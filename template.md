- This repository is forked from [daily-arXiv-ai-enhanced](https://github.com/dw-dengwei/daily-arXiv-ai-enhanced), which crawls daily published arXiv articles and summarizes their abstracts using an LLM.
- ~~This fork is configured for `astro-ph.GA`.~~ From 0710 on, the scope has been expanded to `astro-ph.GA`, `astro-ph.CO` and `astro-ph.IM`.
- The summaries are generated solely based on the article titles and abstracts, without analyzing the full text of the papers.
- For instructions on how to fork, use, and modify the project, please refer to the original repository.
