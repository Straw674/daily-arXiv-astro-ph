- This repository is forked from [daily-arXiv-ai-enhanced](https://github.com/dw-dengwei/daily-arXiv-ai-enhanced), which crawls daily published arXiv articles and summarizes their abstracts using an LLM.
- The original repository targets the `cs.CV` and `cs.CL` categories on arXiv, while this fork is configured for `astro-ph.GA`.
- The summaries are generated solely based on the article titles and abstracts, without analyzing the full text of the papers.
- For instructions on how to fork, use, and modify the project, please refer to the original repository.
