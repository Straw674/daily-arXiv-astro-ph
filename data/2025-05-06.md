### [1] [A XRISM Observation of the Archetypal Radio-Mode Feedback System Hydra-A: Measurements of Atmospheric Motion and Constraints on Turbulent Dissipation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01494)
*Tom Rose,B. R. McNamara,Julian Meunier,A. C. Fabian,Helen Russell,Paul Nulsen,Neo Dizdar,Timothy M. Heckman,Michael McDonald,Maxim Markevitch,Frits Paerels,Aurora Simionescu,Norbert Werner,Alison L. Coil,Edmund Hodges-Kluck,Eric D. Miller,Michael Wise*

**TL;DR**: 通过XRISM Resolve观测Hydra-A星系团，研究其高功率射电喷流对热大气速度结构的影响，发现湍流动能不足以完全抵消冷却效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Hydra-A是一个红移z=0.054的最亮星系团，拥有附近宇宙中最大且最强大的FR-I射电源之一，其中心射电喷流在热大气中形成了X射线空腔。

Data: 使用XRISM Resolve观测数据，覆盖190×190 kpc的区域，包含大部分冷却体积。

Method: 通过分析一维大气速度分布和湍流动能占比，评估射电喷流对热大气的影响。

Result: 观测到一维大气速度分布为164±10 km/s，湍流动能仅占热能的2.5%，不足以完全抵消冷却效应，但射电喷流仍能提供所需动能。

Abstract: We present XRISM Resolve observations centered on Hydra-A, a redshift z =
0.054 brightest cluster galaxy which hosts one of the largest and most powerful
FR-I radio sources in the nearby Universe. We examine the effects of its high
jet power on the velocity structure of the cluster's hot atmosphere. Hydra-A's
central radio jets have inflated X-ray cavities with energies upward of
$10^{61}~\rm erg$. They reach altitudes of 225 kpc from the cluster center,
well beyond the atmosphere's central cooling region. Resolve's $3\times3$
arcmin field-of-view covers $190\times190$ kpc, which encompasses most of the
cooling volume. We find a one dimensional atmospheric velocity dispersion
across the volume of $164\pm10\,\rm{km\,s}^{-1}$. The fraction in isotropic
turbulence or unresolved bulk velocity is unknown. Assuming pure isotropic
turbulence, the turbulent kinetic energy is $2.5\,\%$ of the thermal energy
radiated away over the cooling timescale, implying that kinetic energy must be
supplied continually to offset cooling. While Hydra-A's radio jets are powerful
enough to supply kinetic energy to the atmosphere at the observed level,
turbulent dissipation alone would struggle to offset cooling throughout the
cooling volume. The central galaxy's radial velocity is similar to the
atmospheric velocity, with an offset of $-37 \pm 23\,$ km s$^{-1}$.

**TL;DR**: 在类星体PSO J158-14的前景中发现了一个与极贫金属吸收系统相关的莱曼α发射体候选者，为研究第三族恒星提供了潜在场所。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 在类星体PSO J158-14的前景中，发现了一个莱曼α发射体候选者，与极贫金属吸收系统相关。这一系统在之前的类星体吸收线光谱搜索中被遗漏，因为它未在背景类星体光谱中留下可检测的金属吸收线。

Data: 使用了甚大望远镜/多单元光谱探测器（VLT/MUSE）的档案观测数据，以及麦哲伦望远镜/Folded-port InfraRed Echellette（FIRE）和VLT/X-Shooter光谱仪的中等分辨率光谱数据。

Method: 通过分析莱曼α发射线的红移和类星体邻近区的外缘对齐情况，推测其可能与一个近亚阻尼莱曼α吸收系统相关。

Result: 发现了一个极贫金属的星系候选者，其金属丰度约束为[Z/H] < -3，为研究第三族恒星提供了潜在场所。

Abstract: We report the discovery of a Lyman $\alpha$ emitter (LAE) candidate in the
immediate foreground of the quasar PSO J158-14 at $z_{\rm QSO}=6.0685$ at a
projected distance $\sim29\ {\rm pkpc}$ that is associated with an extremely
metal-poor absorption system. This system was found in archival observations of
the quasar field with the Very Large Telescope/Multi-Unit Spectroscopic
Explorer (VLT/MUSE) and was previously missed in searches of absorption systems
using quasar absorption line spectroscopy as it imparts no detectable metal
absorption lines on the background quasar spectrum. The detected Ly$\alpha$
emission line at a redshift of $z_{\rm LAE}=6.0323$ is well aligned with the
outer edge of the quasar's proximity zone and can plausibly cause its observed
damping wing if it is associated with a proximate sub-damped Ly$\alpha$
absorption system with a column density of $\log {N_{\rm HI} / {\rm cm}^{-2}}
\approx 19.8$. A $>10$ hour medium-resolution spectrum of the quasar observed
with the Magellan/Folded-port InfraRed Echellette (FIRE) and VLT/X-Shooter
spectrographs reveals a metallicity constraint of ${\rm [Z/H]} < -3$. Such low
metallicity makes this system an extremely metal-poor galaxy candidate and
provides an exciting site to study possible signatures of Population III stars.

### [3] [eROSITA view on the Halo Mass-Temperature relation. From low mass groups to massive clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01502)

**TL;DR**: 研究通过eROSITA观测数据验证了从大质量星系团到低质量星系群的质量-温度关系，发现低质量星系群遵循与星系团相同的幂律关系，表明温度可作为整个质量范围内的可靠质量代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系群和星系团是宇宙学背景下结构形成和增长的重要探针，其重子成分主要由星系团内介质（ICM）主导，其热力学性质可用于确定自相似情景下的晕质量。然而，AGN反馈和气体冷却等重子过程可能影响ICM的全局性质，尤其是在星系群范围内，导致其标度关系偏离自相似预测。

Data: 使用eROSITA eRASS1数据对光学选星系群进行光谱叠加，并利用Magneticum流体动力学模拟的eRASS:4模拟数据进行验证。

Method: 通过光谱叠加方法分析eROSITA观测数据，并结合Magneticum模拟数据进行验证。

Result: 研究发现低质量星系群遵循与星系团相同的质量-温度幂律关系，表明AGN反馈更可能影响星系群内介质的重子分布而非整体晕气体温度，温度可作为整个质量范围内的可靠质量代理。

Abstract: Galaxy groups and clusters are one of the best probes of structure formation
and growth in a cosmological context. Most of their baryonic component is
dominated by the intracluster medium (ICM), whose thermodynamical properties
serve as indicators of the halo's dynamical state and can be used for the halo
mass determination in the self-similar scenario. However, baryonic processes,
such as AGN feedback and gas cooling, may affect the global properties of the
ICM, especially in the group regime. These effects might lead to deviations
from self-similar predictions in galaxy groups' scaling relations, while they
remain in place for massive galaxy clusters. Additionally, the low-mass end of
the scaling relations, ranging from $10^{13}$ to $10^{14} M_\odot$, remains
unclear and poorly populated, as current X-ray surveys detect only the
brightest groups. Here, we present the Mass-Temperature relation across the
full mass range, from massive clusters to low-mass groups ($10^{13}M_\odot$),
as observed by eROSITA. Using spectral stacking from eROSITA eRASS1 data for
optically selected galaxy groups, we find that, in the lower mass range, galaxy
groups follow the power-law relation known for galaxy clusters. We further
validate these results by conducting the same stacking procedure on mock
eRASS:4 data using the Magneticum hydrodynamical simulation. This indicates
that AGN feedback is more likely to affect the distribution of baryons in the
intragroup medium rather than the overall halo gas temperature. No significant
changes in the Mass-Temperature relation slope suggest that temperature can
serve as a reliable mass proxy across the entire mass range. This validates the
use of temperature-derived masses, particularly in cosmological studies,
significantly broadening the mass range and enabling applications such as
improving the cluster mass function studies and cosmological parameter
estimates.

### [4] [Physical properties and gas kinematics of massive star forming region G328.24$-$0.55](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01582)
*Chukwuebuka J. Ugwu,James O. Chibueze*

**TL;DR**: 利用ALMA波段6档案数据研究G328.24−0.55恒星形成区中年轻恒星天体的物理和运动学特性，揭示了5个原恒星天体的存在及其不同激发条件和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: G328.24−0.55恒星形成区中年轻恒星天体的物理和运动学特性尚不明确，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Data: ALMA波段6档案数据，包括尘埃连续谱图像和分子跃迁数据。

Method: 通过尘埃连续谱图像和分子跃迁分析，确定原恒星天体的物理和运动学特性。

Result: 发现5个原恒星天体（MM1a、MM1b、MM1c、MM2和MM3），其中MM1a质量最大且存在吸积和外流现象；不同天体的激发条件和质量差异显著。

Abstract: This study presents the results of ALMA band 6 archival data of
G328.24$-$0.55, with the aim to pin down the physical and kinematic properties
of young stellar objects (YSOs) in G328.24$-$0.55 star forming region. The dust
continuum image reveals 5 protostellar objects (MM1a, MM1b, MM1c, MM2 and MM3),
with MM1a dominating the region. The dust continuum peaks do not coincide with
the strongest radio continuum peak previously detected in the region in a
MeerKAT observation, but coincide with the weaker MeerKAT peak. The dust
continuum objects are associated with faint unresolved infrared emission. We
detected 70, 49, 26, 7 and 8 molecular transitions toward MM1a, MM1b, MM1c, MM2
and MM3, respectively. This variation in the number of detected molecular
transitions supports different excitation conditions in these objects. The
excitation temperatures estimated toward MM1a, MM1b and MM1c are $\sim$ 183,
168 and 110\,K, respectively. MM2 and MM3 lack multiple transitions of
molecular lines to determine their excitation temperatures. The masses of MM1a,
MM1b, MM1c, MM2 and MM3 were calculated to be 23.2, 16.1, 12.0, 9.8 and
14.9$M_{\odot}$, respectively. The velocity gradient of CH$_{3}$OH
($10_{2,8}-9_{3,7}$) emission traces a rotating structure, probably an envelope
of gas around MM1a. Bipolar outflow traced by CO emission is seen towards MM1a.
The properties of MM1a clearly point to the existence of a massive protostellar
object that is still undergoing accretion and outflow in its early formative
stage.

### [5] [The mass-morphology relation of TNG50 galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01620)
*Bruno M. Celiz,Julio F. Navarro,Mario G. Abadi,Volker Springel*

**TL;DR**: 通过TNG50宇宙学流体动力学模拟，研究发现星系质量与形态的关系受恒星形成空间分布影响，揭示了矮星系旋转支持较低的原因及其形成机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域关注星系质量与形态的关系，尤其是矮星系与质量较大星系在旋转支持上的差异。TNG50模拟为理解这一关系提供了新的视角。

Data: 使用TNG50宇宙学流体动力学模拟数据，分析恒星质量在8<log(M*/Msun)<11范围内的孤立星系。

Method: 通过TNG50模拟，研究恒星形成在星系内的空间分布及其对星系形态的影响。

Result: 研究发现恒星形成主要集中在两个区域：非旋转的中心重子团块和旋转支持的外盘，解释了矮星系旋转支持较低的原因及其形成机制，并指出模拟中的数值效应可能影响结果。

Abstract: We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation TNG50 to study the galaxy
mass-morphology relation, as measured by the rotational support of the stellar
component of simulated galaxies. For isolated galaxies with stellar mass in the
range $8<\log(M_{*}/M_{\odot}) < 11$, rotational support increases with $M_*$,
from dispersion-supported spheroidal dwarfs to massive galaxies with prominent
rotationally supported discs. Our results indicate that this correlation arises
from the spatial distribution of star formation in TNG50 galaxies, which occurs
primarily in two distinct regions: an unresolved, non-rotating central baryonic
clump $(r \lesssim 1~\mathrm{kpc})$ and a rotationally supported outer disc,
separated by a quiescent region. The importance of the inner clump increases
with decreasing $M_*$; it makes up more than 80\% of all stars in dwarfs. This
explains why dwarfs have less rotational support than massive galaxies, as well
as why all dwarfs have similar stellar half-mass radii regardless of $M_*$. It
also explains why dwarfs in TNG50 appear to form outside-in, as star formation
in the dominant inner clump moves progressively inward. The clump-disc
segregation of star formation in TNG50 galaxies is probably numerical in
origin. Inner clumps are formed by the accumulation of low-angular momentum gas
supported by the equation of state introduced to prevent artificial
fragmentation. The decoupled-wind feedback implementation in TNG50 helps to
preserve the clumps but disrupts disc formation in its immediate surroundings.
This hinders the formation of discs in (dwarf) galaxies whose sizes are not
substantially larger than the clump, but has little effect on the larger discs
of more massive systems. Our results argue for caution when interpreting the
dependence on stellar mass of TNG50 galaxy morphologies, or the evolution of
galaxy sizes, especially at the dwarf end.

### [6] [Identifying Doppelganger Active Galactic Nuclei across redshifts from spectroscopic surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01642)
*Shreya Sareen,Swayamtrupta Panda*

**TL;DR**: 本研究通过分析低红移和高红移活动星系核（AGNs）的光谱特征，发现存在光谱高度相似的AGNs对，表明本地AGNs可能与高红移AGNs具有相似的内在性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 活动星系核（AGNs）是宇宙中最明亮的天体之一，是研究星系演化的有力工具。然而，理解AGN性质如何随时间演化仍是一个基本挑战。本研究探讨低红移AGNs是否能作为高红移AGNs的替代研究对象。

Data: 研究使用了斯隆数字巡天（SDSS）数据发布16中的AGNs光谱数据，包括连续谱和发射线（如N V、C IV、Mg II、Hβ和Fe II的光学与紫外发射线），以及等效宽度、速度弥散（FWHM）和连续谱光度（135nm、300nm和510nm）等性质。

Method: 通过分析AGNs的关键光谱特征，包括发射线性质和连续谱光度，识别光谱高度相似的AGNs对（即'doppelgängers'）。

Result: 初步结果表明存在多个光谱高度相似的AGNs对，表明本地AGNs可能与高红移AGNs具有相似的内在性质，并展示了一个候选AGNs对。

Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are among the most luminous objects in the
universe, making them valuable probes for studying galaxy evolution. However,
understanding how AGN properties evolve over cosmic time remains a fundamental
challenge. This study investigates whether AGNs at low redshift (nearby) can
serve as proxies for their high-redshift (distant) counterparts by identifying
spectral 'doppelg\"angers', AGNs with remarkably similar emission line
properties despite being separated by vast cosmic distances. We analyze key
spectral features of bona fide AGNs using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey's Data
Release 16, including continuum and emission lines: Nitrogen (N V), Carbon (C
IV), Magnesium (Mg II), Hydrogen-beta (H$\beta$), and Iron (Fe II - optical and
UV) emission lines. We incorporated properties such as equivalent width,
velocity dispersion in the form of full width at half maximum (FWHM), and
continuum luminosities (135nm, 300nm, and 510nm) closest to these prominent
lines. Our initial findings suggest the existence of multiple AGNs with highly
similar spectra, hinting at the possibility that local AGNs may indeed share
intrinsic properties with high-redshift ones. We showcase here one of the
better candidate pairs of AGNs resulting from our analyses.

**TL;DR**: 利用澳大利亚望远镜致密阵列（ATCA）对28颗大质量原恒星进行高分辨率观测，揭示了其中80%为喷流结构，68%与非热辐射相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 大质量原恒星在MeerKAT银河平面巡天中被发现，但分辨率较低（约8角秒），无法分辨其细节结构。

Data: 使用ATCA在5.5 GHz和9.0 GHz频率下对28颗大质量原恒星进行观测。

Method: 通过ATCA的高分辨率观测（5.5 GHz时为2.0角秒，9.0 GHz时为1.2角秒）分析原恒星的结构和辐射性质。

Result: 80%的探测对象被分类为喷流，其中68%与非热辐射相关，分辨率提升至1920 AU（最近目标）。

Abstract: We present high-resolution observations made with the Australia Telescope
Compact Array (ATCA) at 5.5 GHz and 9.0 GHz of a sample of twenty-eight massive
protostars. These protostars were initially detected at radio wavelengths in
the MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey at 1.3 GHz, where they were unresolved with
an angular resolution of approximately 8 arcseconds. The resolution of the ATCA
observations at 5.5 GHz and 9.0 GHz are significantly higher at, 2.0 and 1.2
arc seconds, respectively. The highest angular resolution corresponds to a
linear resolution of 1920 AU for our nearest object. This improvement in
resolution enabled us to resolve the components of extended emission and to
more accurately determine the nature of the objects. Approximately 80% of the
detections were classified as jets with 68% of the jets found to be associated
with non-thermal emission.

### [8] [Non-thermal Radio Emission from Massive Protostars in the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01683)
*W. O Obonyo,M. G Hoare,S. L Lumsden,M. A Thompson,J. O. Chibueze,W. D. Cotton,A. Rigby3,P. Leto,C. Trigilio,G. M. Williams*

**TL;DR**: 利用SARAO MeerKAT银河平面巡天数据，研究了已知大质量年轻恒星天体（MYSOs）的L波段发射，发现至少50%的喷流发射非热辐射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 大质量年轻恒星天体（MYSOs）的喷流研究对理解恒星形成过程至关重要，但目前对喷流中非热辐射的研究较少。

Data: 使用了398个来自Red MSX Source（RMS）巡天的大质量原恒星样本，其中162个远离明亮HII区域，适合研究喷流。

Method: 利用MeerKAT观测数据，结合以往观测的流量数据，计算了喷流的光谱指数，并分析了非热辐射的存在。

Result: 研究发现至少50%的喷流发射非热辐射，部分源的SED和射电光度也显示出非热辐射的证据。

Abstract: We present an investigation of the L-band emission from known massive young
stellar objects (MYSOs) in the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey to search
for non-thermal radio emitters in the sample. A total of 398 massive
protostars, identified from the Red MSX Source (RMS) survey, are located within
the survey region. Among these, 162 fields that host the protostars are
isolated from nearby bright HII regions, allowing for the study of any ionized
jets present. Seventy-one of these fields have jets with five-sigma detections
or higher, corresponding to a detection rate of 44%. The MeerKAT fluxes of the
detections, together with the upper limits of the non-detections and any other
fluxes from previous observations, were used to estimate the spectral indices
of the jets, and to search for the presence of non-thermal radiation. In cases
where a source manifests as single in a given observation but is resolved into
multiple components in observations of higher resolutions, the sum of the
fluxes of the resolved components was used in estimating the indices. Any
e!ects from missing flux in higher-resolution observations were incorporated
into the index uncertainties. The spectral indices of the sample show that at
least 50% of the jets emit non-thermal radiation. Additionally, the spectral
energy distribution (SED) of some of the sources, as well as their radio
luminosities exhibit evidence of non-thermal emission, especially in extended
sources.

*Pius Privatus,Umananda Dev Goswami*

**TL;DR**: 该研究利用MaNGA的积分视场光谱数据，探讨了星系形态是否影响其颜色和颜色-星等平面对环境的依赖性，发现形态确实对环境依赖性有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域关注星系形态与其颜色和颜色-星等平面的环境依赖性之间的关系，但现有研究对形态的具体影响尚未充分探讨。

Data: 使用Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA)的积分视场光谱(IFS)数据。

Method: 将星系分为六种形态（椭圆、透镜状、早型、中间型、晚型旋涡和不规则），并进一步分为场环境和群环境，比较颜色分布和颜色-星等平面。

Result: 研究发现中间型和晚型旋涡星系更倾向于存在于场环境中，而早型旋涡星系存在于群环境中；椭圆、透镜状、早型和中间型旋涡星系的颜色和颜色-星等平面对环境有依赖性，而晚型和不规则星系的依赖性较弱，表明形态对环境依赖性有显著影响。

Abstract: This study involves the use of integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data from
Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) to investigate
whether the morphology influences the environmental dependence of galaxies'
colours and the colour-magnitude planes. The galaxies are classified into six
morphologies (Elliptical, Lenticular, Early-type, Intermediate-type, Late-type
spirals and Irregular) and further in field and group environments. The
distributions of colours ($B-V, B-R, u-g, g-r, r-i$ and $i-z$) are compared
between field and group environments and then the colour-magnitude planes are
analysed. It is observed that Intermediate and Late-types spirals
preferentially exist in field environments while Early-type spirals exist in
groups. The colours and colour-magnitude planes of Elliptical, Lenticular,
Early-type and Intermediate-type spirals depend on the environment while for
the Late-type and Irregular galaxies, their dependence on the environment is
very weak. The study concludes that the dependence of colours and
colour-magnitude planes on the environment is influenced by morphology.

*S. Ortolani,S. O. Souza,D. Nardiello,B. Barbuy,E. Bica*

**TL;DR**: 通过贝叶斯等龄线拟合方法，利用哈勃太空望远镜的WFC3和ACS光度数据，确定了NGC 6528和NGC 6553这两个银河系最富金属的球状星团的基本参数，包括年龄、距离、红化和总选择性吸收系数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: NGC 6528和NGC 6553是银河系核球中最富金属的球状星团之一，代表了银河系化学富集的上限，对研究星团形成和富集过程具有重要意义。

Data: 使用了哈勃太空望远镜WFC3和ACS的光度数据，并进行了自行运动校正。

Method: 采用了贝叶斯等龄线拟合方法，通过主序转折点的形态约束年龄和金属丰度。

Result: 两个星团的年龄均为11±0.5 Gyr，金属丰度为太阳值；NGC 6528和NGC 6553的红化分别为E(B-V) = 0.63和0.76，距离分别为7.85和5.1 kpc；这些富金属星团的年龄比中等金属丰度的核球星团年轻约2 Gyr，且与核球场星的年龄和金属丰度高度一致。

Abstract: NGC 6528 and NGC 6553 are among the most metal-rich globular clusters in the
Galactic bulge. They represent the upper end of the chemical enrichment in the
Galaxy, and can inform on the processes of cluster formation and enrichment. We
aim to refine the fundamental parameters of NGC 6528 and NGC 6553, based on
proper motion-corrected Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 and ACS photometries.
Methods. In order to derive the fundamental parameters age, distance,
reddening, and the total-to-selective absorption coefficient, we employed a
Bayesian isochrone fitting. Age and metallicity are mainly constrained by the
turn-off morphology, thanks to the unprecedented quality of the proper-motion
cleaned photometry. The two clusters show remarkably similar Colour-Magnitude
Diagrams. We derived an age of 11+-0.5 Gyr with a solar metallicity for both
clusters. The reddening for NGC 6528 and NGC 6553 is E(B-V) = 0.63 and 0.76 and
the distances from the Sun are d = 7.85 and 5.1 kpc, respectively, recalling
that distances strictly depend on the adopted total-to-selective absorption
parameter. The age of these metal-rich clusters is about 2 Gyr younger than the
moderately metal-poor bulge clusters. The ages and metallicities are remarkably
identical to that of the bulk of bulge field stars.

*Souradeep Bhattacharya,Magda Arnaboldi,Chiaki Kobayashi,Ortwin Gerhard,Kanak Saha*

**TL;DR**: 通过SDSS观测约3000个恒星形成星系，首次揭示了它们在log(O/Ar) vs 12+log(Ar/H)平面上的分布，发现不同质量的星系遵循不同的化学丰度序列，与银河系及其卫星星系中的恒星化学演化序列一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 银河系及其卫星星系中的恒星在α丰度与金属丰度平面上显示出与星系恒星质量相关的序列。然而，由于超出本地群的深吸收线光谱观测主要局限于附近的高质量早型星系，测试这种序列的普遍性一直具有挑战性。

Data: 使用了Sloan-Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)观测的约3000个恒星形成星系（SFGs）的数据，红移范围至z约0.3，直接测定了O和Ar的丰度。

Method: 通过分析SDSS观测数据，直接测定了恒星形成星系中的O和Ar丰度，并研究了它们在log(O/Ar) vs 12+log(Ar/H)平面上的分布。

Result: 研究发现，较高质量（平均质量约2.6×10^9太阳质量）和较低质量（平均质量约1.7×10^7太阳质量）的恒星形成星系在log(O/Ar) vs 12+log(Ar/H)平面上显示出明显的质量依赖性序列，与银河系及其卫星星系中恒星的化学演化序列一致，支持主要由核心坍缩超新星和Ia型超新星驱动的星系化学演化模型。

Abstract: Individual stars in the Milky Way (MW) and its satellites have been shown to
trace galaxy stellar mass dependent sequences in the $\alpha$-abundance
([$\alpha$/Fe]) vs metallicity ([Fe/H]) plane. Testing the universality of such
sequences has been elusive as deep absorption-line spectra required for
[$\alpha$/Fe] and [Fe/H] measurements beyond the local group are mostly limited
to integrated light from nearby, relatively high-mass, early-type galaxies.
However, analogous to [$\alpha$/Fe] vs [Fe/H] for stars, we now have log(O/Ar)
vs 12+log(Ar/H) for the integrated nebular light of star-forming galaxies
(SFGs). From Sloan-Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) observations of $\sim3000$ SFGs
out to z$\sim0.3$, where we directly determined O & Ar abundances, we obtain
for the first time the distribution of an ensemble of SFGs in the log(O/Ar) vs
12+log(Ar/H) plane. We show that higher
(<M$\rm_{*}$>$\sim2.6\times10^9$M$_{\odot}$) and lower mass
(<M$\rm_{*}$>$\sim1.7\times10^7$M$_{\odot}$) SFGs clearly trace distinct mass
dependent sequences in this plane, qualitatively consistent with the mass
dependence of chemical enrichment sequences observed for the stars in the MW
and its satellites. Such sequences are consistent with expectations from galaxy
chemical evolution (GCE) models that are driven primarily by the interplay of
core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae.

**TL;DR**: 通过长期高频率光谱监测15个具有强Fe II发射的PG类星体，首次获得了这些类星体的Hβ宽发射线光变与光学连续谱强度变化之间的精确时间延迟，并计算了中心超大质量黑洞的维里质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前对类星体的研究需要更精确的时间延迟测量以理解其中心超大质量黑洞的性质，现有研究因采样稀疏导致结果不一致。

Data: 使用Calar Alto天文台2.2米望远镜在2017年5月至2020年7月期间对15个PG类星体进行了V波段、5100 Å连续谱和Hβ宽发射线的光变曲线测量。

Method: 通过高频率光谱监测和回响映射技术，测量了Hβ宽发射线光变与光学连续谱强度变化之间的时间延迟，并计算了黑洞的维里质量。

Result: 获得了15个类星体的时间延迟（17.0至95.9天）和黑洞质量（0.50至19.17×10^7太阳质量），其中11个类星体为首次回响分析结果，与早期研究相比时间延迟更精确。

Abstract: We present the first results from long-term high-cadence spectroscopic
monitoring of 15 PG quasars with relatively strong Fe II emission as a part of
a broader reverberation mapping campaign performed with the Calar Alto
Observatory 2.2m telescope. The $V$-band, 5100 \r{A} continuum, and H$\beta$
broad emission line light curves were measured for a set of quasars for between
dozens to more than a hundred epochs from May 2017 to July 2020. Accurate time
lags between the variations of the H$\beta$ broad line fluxes and the optical
continuum strength are obtained for all 15 quasars, ranging from
$17.0_{-3.2}^{+2.5}$ to $95.9_{-23.9}^{+7.1}$ days in the rest frame. The
virial masses of the central supermassive black holes are derived for all 15
quasars, ranging between $0.50_{-0.19}^{+0.18}$ and $19.17_{-2.73}^{+2.98}$ in
units of $10^7 M_\odot$. For 11 of the objects in our sample, this is the first
reverberation analysis published. Of the rest, two objects have been the
subject of previous reverberation studies, but we determine time lags for these
that are only half as long as found in the earlier investigations, which had
only been able to sample much more sparsely. The remaining two objects have
previously been monitored with high sampling rates. Our results here are
consistent with the earlier findings in the sense that the time lag and the
line width vary inversely consistent with virialization.

**TL;DR**: 通过长期高频率的回响映射观测，研究团队测量了11个PG类星体的Hβ时间延迟，并估算了中心超大质量黑洞的质量，扩展了相关样本至26个对象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 此前已有对15个PG类星体的类似研究（Hu et al. 2021），本次研究进一步扩展样本，对11个PG类星体进行了观测，其中8个首次测量了Hβ时间延迟，另外3个对象的先前测量结果不确定性较高。

Data: 研究使用了Calar Alto Observatory的2.2米望远镜获取的长期光变曲线数据，包括V波段光度、5100 Å连续谱和Hβ发射线，观测持续3-6年，频率为6-14天。

Method: 采用长期高频率的回响映射技术，测量Hβ发射线的时间延迟，并基于此估算中心超大质量黑洞的维里质量。

Result: 获得了11个PG类星体的Hβ时间延迟（20-150天），估算的中心黑洞质量范围为3-300×10^7太阳质量；结合先前研究，样本扩展至26个对象，初步拟合Hβ时间延迟与连续谱光度关系的斜率为0.53。

Abstract: We report the results of a long-duration high-cadence reverberation mapping
campaign of a second batch of 11 PG quasars using the 2.2m telescope at the
Calar Alto Observatory. This follows a similar earlier study of another sample
of 15 objects reported by Hu et al. (2021). Among the 11 PG quasars, 8 objects
have the H$\beta$ time lags measured for the first time, while the other 3
objects were observed in previous campaigns, but only had highly uncertain
H$\beta$-lag measurements. Long-term light curves are presented of photometric
$V$-band, spectroscopic 5100 \r{A} continuum, and the H$\beta$ emission line,
lasting for $\sim$3--6 years with a cadence of $\sim$6--14 days. Accurate
H$\beta$ time lags ranging from $\sim$20 to 150 days in the rest frame are
obtained. The estimated virial masses of the central supermassive black holes
range from $\sim$(3--300)$\times10^7 M_\odot$. Combining these results with
those reported in Hu et al. (2021), we now have 26 PG quasars, with
representative properties, having reliable H$\beta$ time-lag measurements from
our long-duration high-cadence campaign. A tentative fit to the relation
between the H$\beta$ time lag and the continuum luminosity for these 26 objects
gives a slope of 0.53.

**TL;DR**: The study evaluates the detection capabilities and morphological measurement accuracy of the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) using mock galaxies, comparing its performance to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and providing correction functions to align CSST measurements with HST standards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) is China's upcoming next-generation ultraviolet and optical survey telescope, with imaging resolution comparable to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The study aims to assess CSST's capabilities in galaxy detection and morphological measurements, addressing potential deficiencies compared to HST.

Data: The study uses a sample of 3,679 CSST realistic mock galaxies constructed from HST CANDELS/GOODS-North deep imaging observations, with stellar masses log(M*/Msun) > 9.0 and redshifts z < 2.

Method: The study evaluates CSST's detection capabilities and the accuracy of measuring non-parametric morphological indicators (C, A, Gini, M20, AO, DO) of galaxies, comparing its performance to HST. Correction functions are provided to adjust CSST measurements to align with HST standards.

Result: CSST's deep field surveys match HST's deep field observations in galaxy detection but show deficiencies in wide-field surveys for high-redshift, low-mass, low-surface-brightness galaxies. Morphological measurements in deep fields are accurate except for the asymmetry indicator (A), while wide-field surveys exhibit systematic biases. Correction functions are provided to align CSST measurements with HST.

Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) is China's upcoming
next-generation ultraviolet and optical survey telescope, with imaging
resolution capabilities comparable to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). In this
study, we utilized a comprehensive sample of 3,679 CSST realistic mock galaxies
constructed from HST CANDELS/GOODS-North deep imaging observations, with
stellar masses $\log\left(M_{*} / M_{\odot}\right) > 9.0$ and redshifts $z <
2$. We evaluate the detection capabilities of CSST surveys and the accuracy in
measuring the non-parametric morphological indicators ($C$, $A$, $Gini$,
$M_{\rm 20}$, $A_{\rm O}$, $D_{\rm O}$) of galaxies. Our findings show that in
terms of galaxy detection capabilities, CSST's deep field surveys can achieve
the same level as HST's deep field observations; however, in wide-field
surveys, CSST exhibits a significant deficiency in detecting high-redshift,
low-mass, low-surface-brightness galaxies. Regarding the measurement of galaxy
morphology, CSST's deep field surveys achieve high accuracy across all
indicators except for the asymmetry indicator ($A$), whereas its wide-field
surveys suffer from significant systematic biases. We thus provide simple
correction functions to adjust the non-parametric morphological indicators
obtained from CSST's wide-field and deep-field observations, thereby aligning
CSST measurements with those from HST. This adjustment enables the direct
application of non-parametric morphological classification methods originally
developed for HST data to galaxies observed by CSST.

### [15] [Toward A General Theory of Grain Alignment and Disruption by Radiative Torques and Magnetic Relaxation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02157)
*Thiem Hoang*

**TL;DR**: 该研究推广了磁增强辐射扭矩（MRAT）对齐理论，分析了不同天体物理环境下的颗粒对齐和旋转破坏机制，揭示了辐射场强度对颗粒对齐效率的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域关注颗粒在辐射场和磁场作用下的对齐机制，但现有研究对辐射场强度与颗粒对齐效率的关系尚未充分探讨。本研究通过推广MRAT理论，填补了这一空白。

Data: 研究使用了无量纲参数U/(n1T2)来描述天体物理环境，其中U为局部辐射强度，n1为氢密度，T2为气体温度。

Method: 研究首先推导了临界磁弛豫δmag,cri，随后通过数值模拟研究了MRAT机制下的颗粒对齐和旋转破坏，考虑了气体碰撞和磁涨落的影响。

Result: 研究发现，在碰撞主导（CD）区域，颗粒可实现完美慢对齐；在辐射主导（RD）区域，颗粒对齐效率受辐射扭矩捕获效应限制；极端辐射场下，磁弛豫对对齐效率的贡献被抑制。

Abstract: We generalize the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment
theory for general astrophysical environments described by a dimensionless
parameter $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$ with $U$ local radiation strength, $n_{1}=n_{\rm
H}/(10{\rm cm}^{-3})$ the hydrogen density, and $T_{2}=T_{\rm gas}/100{\rm K}$
the gas temperature. We first derive the critical magnetic relaxation
$\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ required to produce high-J attractors for different RAT
models and local conditions and find that $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ must be larger
for stronger radiation fields. We then numerically study the grain alignment
and rotational disruption by the MRAT mechanism taking into account gas
collisions and magnetic fluctuations. We find that, for the collision-dominated
(CD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})\leq 1$), collisional and magnetic excitations can
slowly transport large grains from low-J rotation to high-J attractors, leading
to the perfect {\it slow alignment} within $\sim 10-100$ damping times due to
MRATs. However, for the radiation-dominated (RD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})>1$),
only a fraction of grains can be fast aligned at high-J attractors by MRATs,
and the majority of grains are trapped at low-J rotation due to strong
radiative torques, a new effect we term {\it radiative torque (RAT) trapping}.
For extreme radiation fields of $U/(n_{1}T_{2})>10^{4}$, the efficiency of
magnetic relaxation on grain alignment is suppressed, and grains only have fast
alignment and disruption purely determined by RATs. We quantified the fraction
of grains with fast alignment at high-J attractors, $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm
fast}$, for different RAT models, magnetic relaxation, and $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$,
and found that the maximum $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$ can reach $45\%$ by
MRATs and $22\%$ by RATs.

*Artak Mkrtchyan,Dieter Horns*

**TL;DR**: 研究估计了银河系类似星系中未合并的中等质量黑洞数量及其对背景光的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 中等质量黑洞（10^2 - 10^5 M⊙）的存在尚未被确认，它们可能压缩周围暗物质分布形成“尖峰”，若暗物质自湮灭，可能产生可探测的伽马射线。

Data: 使用A-SLOTH半解析模拟代码模拟和追踪Population III恒星。

Method: 通过将Population III双黑洞合并率应用于由Population III恒星形成率确定的有效体积，约束中等质量黑洞数量。

Result: 预计银河系类似星系中存在约130个未合并的中等质量黑洞，其前身对近红外背景光的贡献低于10^-3 nW m^-2 sr^-1。

Abstract: The mass range of observed black holes extends from stellar-mass to
supermassive scales, yet the existence of objects in the intermediate-mass
range of $10^{2} - 10^{5} \text{M}_{\odot}$ remains unconfirmed. Black holes
are suspected to compress the surrounding dark matter distribution, forming a
``spike''. If dark matter is self-annihilating, the spike could produce
gamma-ray emission sufficiently luminous to be detected. This work aims to
estimate the number of expected unmerged intermediate-mass black holes in a
Milky Way-like galaxy that could form such spikes. These intermediate-mass
black holes are assumed to have formed from the collapse of high-mass
Population III stars, such that the resulting merger rate is constrained by
observations of gravitational wave emission. It is furthermore estimated to
what extent the progenitor Population III stars contribute to the extragalactic
background light. The Population III stars are simulated and tracked using the
A-SLOTH semi-analytical simulation code and the resulting number of
intermediate-mass black holes is constrained by applying the Population III
binary black hole merger rate to an effective volume determined from the
Population III star formation rate. In this framework, $\sim 130$ unmerged
IMBHs from Population III stars are expected to reside in a Milky Way-like
galaxy. The contribution of their progenitors to the EBL in the near-infrared
is less than $10^{-3} \text{nW} \text{m}^{-2} \text{sr}^{-1}$, well below
previous estimates.

Background: 研究背景包括利用Edelson和Malkan（2012）以及Stern等人（2012）的选择技术识别AGN候选者，并通过后续观测验证这些候选者的身份。

Data: 使用了125个来自Lick 3米望远镜的长缝光学光谱、58个来自Palomar 5米望远镜的光谱和3个来自Keck 10米望远镜的光谱。

Method: 采用了Edelson和Malkan（2012）以及Stern等人（2012）的选择技术，并通过光学光谱验证候选者身份，进一步通过Baldwin, Phillips & Terlevich图和光谱能量分布（SED）比较分析样本性质。

Result: 确认了105个Type 1 AGN和35个Type 2 AGN，总体可靠性约为75%，主要方法的可靠性为87%-96%，样本的AGN群体与其他方法识别的结果一致。

Abstract: We utilized the Edelson and Malkan (2012) and Stern et al. (2012) selection
techniques and other methods to identify AGN candidates that were monitored
during the Kepler prime and K2 missions. Subsequent to those observations, we
obtained 125 long-slit optical spectra with the Lick 3-m telescope, 58 spectra
with the Palomar 5-m telescope, and three with the Keck 10-m telescope to test
these identifications. Of these 186 AGN candidates, 105 were confirmed as Type
1 AGN and 35 as Type 2 AGN, while the remaining 46 were found to have other
identifications (e.g., stars and normal galaxies). This indicated an overall
reliability of about 75%, while the two main methods had much higher
reliability, 87%-96%. The spectra indicated redshifts out to z = 3.4. Then, we
examined the AGN sample properties through the Baldwin, Phillips & Terlevich
diagram and compared the AGN's spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with those
from the literature. We found that our sample yielded the same AGN population
as those identified through other methods, such as optical spectroscopy.

**TL;DR**: 本研究通过比较SIMBA宇宙学模拟数据与GAMA、G10-COSMOS和3D-HST观测数据，揭示了模拟与观测在贫尘和富尘星系中的显著偏差，指出差异源于星系群体和SIMBA模拟的局限性而非尘埃物理机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系中尘埃的丰度直接影响其演化，现有模型通过模拟尘埃的生成、增长和破坏过程来匹配这一丰度，但这些模型需要改进，尤其是在早期宇宙阶段。

Data: 使用了来自SIMBA宇宙学模拟套件的数据，以及来自Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA)、G10-COSMOS子集和哈勃太空望远镜(3D-HST)的观测数据。

Method: 在恒星质量范围(10^8.59 < M⊙ < 10^11.5)和红移区间(z = 0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5)内，选择均匀尘埃质量范围(10^6 < MD [M⊙] < 10^9)的星系进行比较分析。

Result: 结果显示SIMBA模拟数据与观测数据在贫尘和富尘星系中存在显著偏差，差异主要源于星系群体和SIMBA模拟的局限性，而非尘埃物理机制本身。

Abstract: The abundance of dust within galaxies directly influences their evolution.
Contemporary models attempt to match this abundance by simulating the processes
of dust creation, growth, and destruction. While these models are accurate,
they require refinement, especially at earlier epochs. This study aims to
compare simulated and observed datasets and identify discrepancies between the
two, providing a basis for future improvements. We utilise simulation data from
the SIMBA cosmological simulation suite and observed data from the Galaxy and
Mass Assembly (GAMA), a subset of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (G10-COSMOS), and
the Hubble Space Telescope (3D-HST). We selected galaxies in the observed and
simulated data in a stellar mass range of $(10^{8.59} < M_\odot < 10^{11.5})$
and at redshift bins centering around $(z = 0.0)$, $(z = 0.1)$, $(z = 0.5)$,
$(z = 1.0)$, and $(z = 1.5)$ in a homogeneous dust mass range $((10^{6} < M_D
[M_\odot] < 10^{9}))$. Our results show notable deviations between SIMBA and
observed data for dust-poor and rich galaxies, with strong indications that
differences in galaxy populations and SIMBA limitations are the underlying
cause rather than the dust physics implemented in SIMBA itself.

**TL;DR**: 研究通过AutoMeKin工具探索了甘油醛（GCA）及其类似物在星际介质中的气相化学反应网络，揭示了其形成的可能途径及主要产物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星际介质中复杂有机分子的形成对天体化学和生命前化学至关重要，甘油醛（GCA）虽未在星际介质中被直接检测到，但其结构类似物的存在暗示其可能在星际条件下形成。

Data: 研究使用了C3H6O3（GCA）、C3H7O3（氢化类似物）和C2H5O2的气相化学反应网络数据。

Method: 采用AutoMeKin工具系统探索反应网络，反应路径在wB97XD/Def2-TZVPP理论水平表征，关键过程的速率系数通过竞争性标准统一统计（CCUS）模型计算。

Result: 研究发现甘油醛的形成途径多为瞬态且难以直接检测，而甲醛、乙醇醛和(Z)-乙烯-1,2-二醇等产物更符合当前天文观测结果。

Abstract: The formation of complex organic molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM)
is central to astrochemistry and prebiotic chemistry, as these species may act
as precursors to biomolecules essential for life. Although glyceraldehyde
(HOCH2CH(OH)C(O)H, GCA) has not yet been detected in the ISM, the presence of
structurally related compounds in various astronomical environments suggests
that it may form under interstellar conditions. In this study, we employed the
automated reaction discovery tool AutoMeKin to systematically explore the
gas-phase chemical reaction networks (CRNs) of C3H6O3 (GCA), C3H7O3 (a
hydrogenated analog), and C2H5O2. Reaction pathways were characterized at the
wB97XD/Def2-TZVPP level of theory, and rate coefficients for key processes were
computed using the competitive canonical unified statistical (CCUS) model,
which accounts for multiple dynamic bottlenecks. Our analysis revealed several
barrierless pathways leading to GCA or to GCA and a leaving group. Notably, the
reaction between glyoxal (HCOHCO) and the HOCHCH2OH radical, though neither has
yet been detected in the ISM, was found to efficiently produce GCA and a formyl
radical. However, aside from the aforementined exception, most GCA formation
channels result in highly vibrationally excited intermediates that are more
likely to undergo rapid unimolecular decomposition than to be stabilized by
radiative emission under typical ISM conditions. These results suggest that
while gas-phase GCA formation is chemically feasible, it is likely transient
and difficult to detect directly. In contrast, alternative products such as
formaldehyde, glycolaldehyde, and (Z)-ethene-1,2-diol dominate many pathways
and align better with current astronomical observations.

Background: 超新星观测表明II型超新星前身星周围存在密集且不对称的星周环境，但红超巨星的质量损失仍不清楚。

Data: 使用NOEMA在230 GHz的干涉观测数据。

Method: 通过干涉观测估计尘埃质量和温度，测量星周环境的范围和形态复杂性。

Result: 探测到两个强连续谱成分，总尘埃质量约为2×10^-3太阳质量，位于距恒星约2000 AU处；CO发射范围支持质量损失率为每年几×10^-4太阳质量；发现未解析的高速成分，并提出可能存在未知双星伴星。

Abstract: Supernova observations imply the presence of a dense and asymmetric
circumstellar environment around SN Type II progenitors, whereas the mass loss
from these progenitors, namely, red supergiants, is still poorly constrained.
We aim to characterise the dust and gas in the circumstellar environment of the
extreme Galactic red supergiant \nmlcyg in terms of mass, morphology, and
kinematics. Based on interferometric observations with NOEMA at 230 GHz we
estimated dust masses and temperatures, and measured the extent and
morphological complexity of the circumstellar environment. We detected two
strong continuum components, amounting to an estimated total dust mass of
$\sim2\times10^{-3}M_{\odot}$ located out to ~2000 AU from the star, largely
beyond the dust detected at optical/infrared wavelengths. The extent of the
detected CO emission supports the notion that the outflow is formed by a
mass-loss rate of several $10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$/year and that it is not
primarily shaped by extreme irradiation from the Cyg OB2 cluster it has been
associated with. We have detected, but not resolved, previously unseen
high-velocity components close to the star. The observations reveal a very
complex circumstellar morphology and we propose that some of the detected
components could be the imprint of a hitherto unknown binary companion.

Method: 分析了暗物质晕旋转矢量的演化，并构建了一个简单的随机模型来模拟其演化过程。

Result: 发现暗物质晕旋转矢量的演化存在特征平面，且该平面可能反映了周围大尺度结构的几何特征；随机模型能够重现N体模拟中的主要特征。

Abstract: We follow the spin vector evolutions of well resolved dark matter haloes
(containing more than 300 particles) in merger tree main branches from the
Millennium and Millennium-II N-body simulations, from z about 3.3 to z = 0. We
find that there seems to be a characteristic plane for the spin vector
evolution along each main branch. In the direction perpendicular to it, spin
vectors oscillate around the plane, while within the plane, spin vectors show a
coherent direction change as well as a diffusion in direction (possibly
corresponds to a Gaussian white noise). This plane may reflect the geometry of
surrounding large-scale structures. We also construct a simple stochastic model
in which halo spin vector evolution is assumed to be driven by accretion of
halo mass and angular momentum. This model can reproduce major features of the
results from N-body simulations.

**TL;DR**: 研究发现在1 < z < 2的过渡时期，星系团环境对星系的红外和射电辐射有显著影响，尤其是在低红移（1 < z < 1.37）时，红外-射电相关性参数差异更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 在1 < z < 2的过渡时期，星系团中的星系首次开始普遍停止恒星形成，研究环境对星系红外和射电辐射的影响具有重要意义。

Data: 使用了来自IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey (ISCS)、IRAC Distant Cluster Survey (IDCS)的129个星系团成员星系数据，以及Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA)的3 GHz射电图像。

Method: 通过计算红外-射电相关性斜率参数q，比较星系团星系与场星系样本在不同红移下的差异，并使用Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验分析显著性。

Result: 研究发现星系团星系与场星系的红外-射电相关性参数存在显著差异（~2sigma-3sigma水平），低红移（1 < z < 1.37）时差异更明显；活动星系核（AGNs）对结果无显著影响。

Abstract: We investigate the effect of the environment on the infrared and radio
emission of cluster galaxies during the transition epoch at 1 < z < 2 when they
first start to quench consistently in the majority of galaxy clusters. We
considered a sample of 129 cluster member galaxies from 11 massive clusters at
a confirmed redshift of 1.0-1.8 from the IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey (ISCS),
the IRAC Distant Cluster Survey (IDCS), and new 3 GHz images from the Karl G.
Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We calculated the IR-radio correlation slope
parameter, q, in order to identify differences in the ratios of IR to radio of
cluster galaxies and field galaxy comparison samples at different redshifts.
Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) were identified and analyzed to search for any
effect on the IR-radio correlation. The correlation parameter values were also
compared by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with field galaxies. Our comparison of
the IR-radio correlation in cluster galaxies to the control sample of field
galaxies reveals a marginally to modestly significant difference in the
correlation slope parameter at the ~2sigma-3sigma level. A split of the
clusters into low-redshift (1 < z < 1.37) and high-redshift (1.37 < z < 1.8)
bins indicates a more significant difference in the correlation parameter in
the lower redshift cluster subsample, where widespread quenching begins. We
find no difference in the IR-radio correlation between galaxies that host AGNs
and non-active star-forming galaxies either. This suggests that our AGNs are
overwhelmingly radio quiet and therefore do not affect the results we described
above. We conclude that further investigations based on larger datasets are
needed to constrain the impact of the cluster environment on the IR-radio
correlation better.

*Christopher J. R. Clark,Julia. C. Roman-Duval,Suzanne C. Madden Marc Mertens,Claire E. Murray,Jürgen Stutzki,Elizabeth Tarantino,and Kirill Tchernyshyov*

**TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种利用远红外[CII]吸收线测量弥散星际介质中碳丰度和消耗的新方法，并通过SOFIA的初步研究验证了其可行性，同时探讨了未来远红外望远镜的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 碳在星际介质中扮演着重要角色，但关于其在弥散星际介质中的丰度和消耗的测量非常有限，传统紫外测量方法难度大且数据稀少。

Data: 使用了SOFIA观测的IC342和Circinus星系视线方向的[CII]吸收数据。

Method: 提出了一种通过远红外158微米[CII]吸收线测量碳丰度和消耗的新方法，并进行了初步观测验证。

Result: 在IC342视线方向上可能探测到了银河系[CII]吸收，但需要进一步分离IC342自身的发射；Circinus视线方向因仪器基线不稳定未能成功探测。研究还评估了未来远红外望远镜的探测潜力。

Abstract: Carbon plays key roles in the InterStellar Medium (ISM) -- as a constituent
of dust, as the carrier of the dominant far-infrared cooling line, and as a
component of various important molecules. But despite this, there are very few
measurements of the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse ISM. As
with other elements, these measurements are traditionally performed in the
ultraviolet. But for carbon, such measurements are extremely difficult, and
less than 20 have been reported in the literature to date. Here, we present a
novel method of measuring the abundance and depletion of carbon in the diffuse
ISM: by observing absorption of the 158 $\mu$m [CII] line in the far-infrared.
We present a catalog of 432 candidate sightlines that use bright nearby
galaxies as background sources, and predict the [CII] absorption expected
towards each. We conducted a pilot study using SOFIA, targeting sightlines
towards the galaxies IC342 and Circinus. We report a potential detection of
Galactic [CII] absorption along the IC342 sightline, although it requires
disentangling [CII] emission from IC342 itself. The Circinus sightline had an
insufficiently stable instrumental baseline to allow a detection. This SOFIA
study informs the prospects for [CII] absorption measurements with future
facilities. To that end, we explore the potential for four proposed future FIR
telescopes -- PRIMA, FIRSST, SALTUS, and Origins -- to detect [CII] absorption.
We find that all four facilities would be able to detect [CII] absorption along
a significant number of sightlines.

### [24] [Molecular gas excitation and outflow properties of obscured quasars at z$\sim$0.1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02759)
*A. Audibert,C. Ramos Almeida,S. García-Burillo,G. Speranza,I. Lamperti,M. Pereira-Santaella,F. Panessa*

**TL;DR**: 本文通过高分辨率ALMA观测研究了六颗z∼0.1的II型类星体，发现分子外流与高激发气体区域共位，且外流速率远低于AGN光度预期，表明喷流和风的共同作用可能是驱动外流的主要机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究背景聚焦于探讨风和低至中等功率喷流对AGN冷分子气体储层的影响，尤其是II型类星体中分子气体的激发和外流特性。

Data: 使用了ALMA的CO(2-1)和CO(3-2)高角分辨率观测数据，样本来自Quasar Feedback (QSOFEED)的六颗z∼0.1的II型类星体。

Method: 通过空间分辨的分子线比率图（R32 = L'CO(3-2)/L'CO(2-1)）和运动学建模，约束气体激发变化并识别气体外流。

Result: 研究发现分子外流与R32>1的区域共位，表明外流中存在温度升高和光学薄气体；外流速率范围为5-150太阳质量/年，远低于AGN光度预期；喷流和风的共同作用可能是驱动外流的主要机制，且喷流与ISM的耦合在AGN反馈中可能起重要作用。

Abstract: To investigate the impact of winds and low-to-moderate power jets on the cold
molecular gas reservoirs of AGN, we present high angular resolution ALMA
CO(2-1) and CO(3-2) observations of a sample of six type-2 quasars (QSO2s) at
z$\sim$0.1 from the Quasar Feedback (QSOFEED) sample. Spatially resolved
molecular line ratio maps, defined as $R_{32}=L'_{CO(3-2)}/L'_{CO(2-1)}$, and
kinematic modelling were used to constrain changes in gas excitation and to
identify gas outflows, respectively. We find that the molecular outflows are
co-spatial with regions with $R_{32}$>1, indicating enhanced temperature
relative to the discs and the presence of optically thin gas in the outflows.
We find mass outflow rates of 5$<\dot{M}_{out}<$150$M_\odot$/yr, much lower
than those expected from their AGN luminosities of $10^{45.5-46}$erg/s. The
outflow kinetic energies might be driven by the combined action of jets and
winds/radiation pressure, with radiative coupling efficiencies
($\epsilon_{AGN}=\dot{E}_{out}/L_{bol}$) ranging from
$10^{-6}<\epsilon_{AGN}<10^{-4}$ and jet coupling efficiencies
($\epsilon_{jet}=\dot{E}_{out}/P_{jet}$) from $10^{-3}<\epsilon_{AGN}<10^{-2}$.
A linear regression including the six QSO2s follows the locus of
$\epsilon_{jet}\sim$0.1\%. Our results provide evidence that AGN-driven
jets/winds disturb the molecular gas kinematics and excitation within the
central kpc of the galaxies. The coupling between compact jets and the ISM
might be relevant to AGN feedback, even in the case of radio-quiet galaxies,
which are more representative of the AGN population. Finally, we find that the
warm and cold molecular gas phases seem to be tracing the same outflow, with
the main distinction between them being the mass they carry, while the warm
ionized outflows do not seem to be another face of the same outflow, as they
show different orientation, velocity, and radius.

### [25] [The Rapidly--Changing Period of the QPE Source 1ES~1927+654](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02832)
*Andrew King*

**TL;DR**: 该研究提出，低质量星系核中的准周期性喷发（QPEs）现象可能是由von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai（ZLK）周期引起的，并通过1ES~1927+654系统的观测数据验证了这一假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 近年来，观测到多个低质量星系核中出现了准周期性喷发（QPEs）现象。其中，1ES~1927+654系统的准周期在短短两年内从约18分钟变为约7.1分钟，这一剧烈变化引发了对其机制的探讨。

Data: 研究使用了1ES~1927+654系统的观测数据，特别是其准周期从18分钟变为7.1分钟的变化过程。

Method: 研究提出了von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai（ZLK）周期作为解释机制，并通过模型分析验证了白矮星轨道平面与远距离恒星轨道平面之间的振荡关系。

Result: 研究发现，白矮星轨道平面的振荡幅度约为71度，且轨道偏心率和准周期变化与引力辐射驱动的吸积光度相关。QPE系统可能是多恒星复杂坠落事件的产物，未来需要进一步监测。

Abstract: Several low--mass galaxy nuclei are observed to produce quasiperiodic
eruptions (QPEs). Recently one of these systems, 1ES~1927+654, changed its
quasiperiod drastically, from $\sim 18$ minutes to $\sim 7.1$ minutes, over a
span of just two years. I suggest that this is an effect of von Zeipel -- Lidov
-- Kozai (ZLK) cycles, where a more distant star orbits the QPE `binary' in
which a white dwarf orbits a moderately massive central black hole. I show that
in 1ES~1927+654 the white dwarf's orbital plane oscillates with angular
amplitude $\simeq 71^{\circ}$ each side of the orbital plane of the distant
star. This causes correlated changes of the orbital eccentricity and
quasiperiod, and of the accretion luminosity driven by gravitational radiation
losses. The GR luminosity has the characteristic property that it is inversely
proportional to the instantaneous binary quasiperiod in all cases. The QPE
system is probably just one of the effects produced by a complex infall event
involving several stars. The whole system is likely to evolve rapidly, and will
repay further monitoring.

### [26] [SHAPE: cosmology with cluster halo intrinsic alignments from subhalo distributions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01588)
*Shogo Ishikawa,Atsushi Taruya,Takahiro Nishimichi,Teppei Okumura,Satoshi Tanaka*

**TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种名为SHAPE的新技术，通过子晕分布重建星系团晕的形状，用于研究晕形状与周围密度场的内在关联性，并展示了其在宇宙学参数估计中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系团追踪了最巨大的暗物质晕，其形状和方向反映了宇宙大尺度潮汐场的印记。目前的研究需要一种新方法来更准确地测量晕形状及其与周围密度场的关联性。

Data: 研究使用了N体模拟数据，包括真实空间和红移空间的数据。

Method: 本文提出了SHAPE技术，通过子晕的投影分布重建晕的形状和方向，并计算了内在关联性相关函数。

Result: SHAPE技术能够准确恢复晕的形状和方向，其内在关联性相关函数显示出与重子声学振荡和红移空间畸变一致的特征，且能无偏估计结构增长率参数。

Abstract: Galaxy clusters trace the most massive dark matter haloes, whose shapes and
orientations reflect the imprint of the cosmic large-scale tidal field. This
paper introduces the Subhalo-based Halo Alignment and Projected Ellipticity
(SHAPE) technique, which reconstructs cluster halo shapes from the projected
distribution of subhaloes, providing a novel approach to investigate intrinsic
alignment (IA) correlations between cluster halo shapes and the surrounding
density field. We measure halo shapes and orientations using different
line-of-sight projection depths and find that, with modest projection depths,
the shapes and orientations recovered by SHAPE show good agreement with those
measured directly from the simulation particles. Using these SHAPE-derived
shapes, we compute IA correlation functions from N-body simulations in both
real and redshift space. The IA correlation multipoles exhibit features
consistent with baryon acoustic oscillations around 100 Mpc/h and show
redshift-space distortion (RSD) effects that agree well with predictions from a
non-linear alignment model incorporating RSD. We further demonstrate that the
structure growth rate parameter can be robustly estimated without bias from
these IA correlations, providing a new avenue for cosmological parameter
estimation. Expanding the IA correlations in an associated Legendre basis
yields results consistent with those from the standard Legendre expansion, but
with improved statistical significance. These results suggest that SHAPE may
enhance cosmological parameter constraints in future galaxy surveys.

*M. Mugrauer,A. -K. Kollak,L. Pietsch,K. -U. Michel*

**TL;DR**: 该研究利用Gaia任务的数据，对745颗TESS目标恒星进行了多星性调查，发现了92个双星系统和2个三合星系统，并分析了伴星的质量和分离距离分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前对TESS目标恒星的多星性研究仍存在不足，尤其是伴星的性质和分布特征尚未充分探索。本研究利用Gaia任务的最新数据填补了这一空白。

Data: 使用了ESA Gaia任务最新发布的天体测量和光度数据。

Method: 通过分析Gaia数据中的天体测量和光度信息，检测并表征了目标恒星的伴星性质。

Result: 研究发现92个双星系统和2个三合星系统，伴星质量范围为0.12到1.6太阳质量，分离距离为110到9600天文单位，且在300到800天文单位范围内伴星频率最高。此外，还发现了5颗白矮星伴星。

Abstract: In this paper we present the latest results of our ongoing multiplicity
survey of (Community) TESS Objects of Interest, using astrometry and photometry
from the latest data release of the ESA Gaia mission to detect stellar
companions of these stars and to characterize their properties. A total of 92
binary and two hierarchical triple star systems are identified among the 745
target stars whose multiplicity is explored in this study, all at distances of
less than 500pc around the Sun. As expected for components of gravitationally
bound star systems, the targets and the detected companions are at the same
distance and share a common proper motion, as shown by their accurate Gaia
astrometry. The companions have masses of about 0.12 to 1.6$M_\odot$. and are
most frequently found in the mass range up to 0.6$M_\odot$. The companions have
projected separations from the targets between about 110 and 9600au. Their
frequency is highest and constant from about 300 to 800au, decreasing at larger
projected separations. In addition to main sequence stars, five white dwarf
companions are detected in this study, whose true nature is unveiled by their
photometric properties.

*S. de Wit,G. Muñoz-Sanchez,G. Maravelias,A. Z. Bonanos,K. Antoniadis,D. García-Álvarez,N. Britavskiy,A. Ruiz,A. Philippopoulou*

**TL;DR**: 通过光学光谱调查NGC 6822、IC 10和IC 1613中的演化大质量恒星，ASSESS项目揭示了尘埃环境中的红超巨星（RSGs）与质量损失的关系，并发现尘埃RSGs更冷、更亮、更易变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 大质量恒星的质量损失对其演化和爆炸过程至关重要，但间歇性质量损失的研究仍不充分。

Data: 使用NGC 6822、IC 10和IC 1613中122个独特源的光谱数据，其中大部分具有尘埃环境。

Method: 通过光谱分类、MARCS模型获取表面特性（如有效温度）和光谱能量分布拟合获取恒星光度，并分析光学光度变异性。

Result: 发现尘埃RSGs比非尘埃RSGs更冷、更亮、更易变，并确认了多个候选间歇性质量损失源，如两个光谱类型变化的RSGs和四个尘埃K型RSGs。

Abstract: Mass loss in massive stars is crucial to understanding how these stars evolve
and explode. Despite increasing evidence indicating its importance, episodic
mass loss remains poorly understood. Here we report the results of an optical
spectroscopic survey of evolved massive stars in NGC 6822, IC 10, and IC 1613,
conducted by the ASSESS project (Episodic Mass Loss in Evolved Massive Stars:
Key to Understanding the Explosive Early Universe), which aimed to investigate
the role of episodic mass loss, by targeting stars with infrared excesses
indicating a dusty circumstellar environment. We assigned a spectral class to
122 unique sources, the majority of which are dusty. The rate of evolved
massive stars was over 60% for the highest-priority targets. We discovered 2
blue supergiants, 1 yellow supergiant, 1 emission-line object, and confirmed 2
supernova remnant candidates, a Wolf-Rayet star, and 2 H II regions.
Twenty-eight unique sources were classified as red supergiants, 21 of which are
new discoveries. In IC 10, we increased the sample of spectroscopically
confirmed RSGs from 1 to 17. We used the MARCS models to obtain their surface
properties, most importantly the effective temperature, and spectral energy
distribution fitting to obtain the stellar luminosity for 17 of them. The dusty
RSGs are cooler, more luminous, more extinguished, and more evolved than the
non-dusty ones, in agreement with previous findings. Investigating the optical
photometric variability of the RSGs from light curves covering a period over a
decade revealed that the dusty RSGs are more variable. We further highlight the
very extinguished emission-line object, two RSGs that display a significant
change in spectral type between two observed epochs, and four dusty K-type RSGs
as candidates for having undergone episodic mass loss.

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过分析Gaia档案数据寻找原初黑洞（PBHs），尽管未成功，但指出未来利用Rubin望远镜进行微引力透镜观测是探测PBHs的有效工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 原初黑洞（PBHs）在天文学中具有重要意义，可能解释暗物质、解决哈勃张力问题以及作为超大质量黑洞的来源。尽管Stephen Hawking和Albert Einstein曾对其探测持悲观态度，但技术进步为探测PBHs提供了新机会。

Data: 研究使用了Gaia档案中的数据。

Method: 研究通过分析Gaia档案数据进行了PBHs的搜索，并建议未来利用Rubin望远镜进行微引力透镜观测。

Result: 尽管在Gaia档案中未发现PBHs的证据，但研究指出微引力透镜技术是未来探测PBHs的关键工具。

Abstract: In the Brief History of Time Stephen Hawking was pessimistic about
astronomers detecting primordial black holes (PBHs). He would not be the only
distinguished scientist to underestimate the extraordinary power of new
technology. In a related area Albert Einstein published the equations for
microlensing, but wrote off their practicality. Perhaps they meant "during my
lifetime." The amazing properties of PBHs, however, validate heroic efforts to
detect them. If they exist, their niches in our current history of time include
supplying dark matter to bind galaxies, offering a solution for the Hubble
tension, and, as supermassive black holes, giving us quasars as far as the eye
can see. This Research Note describes a search for PBHs in the Gaia archive. In
spite of the high density of local dark matter, it was unsuccessful.
Microlensing with the Rubin telescope is the tool at our disposal to open the
asteroid window for PBH.

**TL;DR**: 通过7年的机器人望远镜观测，研究发现NGC2261反射星云中存在持续的低水平光暗波纹，揭示了R Monocerotis周围薄屏状反射物质的结构和运动特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: NGC2261是一个由年轻恒星R Monocerotis照亮的反射星云，因其附近移动物体偶尔投射阴影而被称为哈勃变光星云。

Data: 自2017年春季以来的7年间，机器人望远镜收集了约每周两次的观测数据，共获得1000多张不同时期的图像。

Method: 通过分析图像中的光暗波纹变化，研究了R Mon的光输出变化及其反射物质的结构和运动特性。

Result: 研究发现反射物质呈薄屏状（厚度小于3x10^16厘米），形状类似半抛物面，密度高于1.7x10^5cm^-3，并以几公里/秒的速度向我们移动，与R Mon的流出物质一致。

Abstract: NGC2261 is a reflection nebula illuminated by the young star R Monocerotis.
Objects moving near the star occasionally cast shadows on the nebula, giving
rise to its alternative name: Hubble's Variable Nebula. For 7 years since
Spring 2017 robotic telescopes have been used to compile a roughly twice-weekly
record of changes in the object. The results, over 1000 images at separate
epochs, have been compiled into a movie. This shows that, as well as the large
scale but infrequent variability for which it is famous, the nebula is
continually traversed by low level `ripples' of light and dark. These record
changes in the light output from R Mon and analysis of their progress indicates
that the reflecting material takes the form of a thin (<3x10^16cm) screen whose
shape resembles a half paraboloid, rooted at the star and bowed towards us. The
brightness of the screen in Herschel far-IR maps indicates a density n_H>
1.7x10^5cm^-3 and CO observations show the material is moving towards us at a
few km/s relative to the rest cloud, consistent it with being a dense shell of
material displaced by R~Mon's outflow. The results demonstrate the value of
studying such objects in the time domain, and are a glimpse of what will be
achieved by instruments like the Zwicky Transient Facility and Vera Rubin
Observatory.

**TL;DR**: The study investigates the EXor-type young star Gaia23bab during its 2023 outburst, measuring its accretion rate and physical properties through optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Episodic accretion is a key process in stellar mass build-up, with EX Lupi-type eruptive young stars (EXors) being a primary type. The research focuses on Gaia23bab, a recently discovered EXor, to understand its outburst behavior and physical properties.

Data: Optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy data were collected during the 2023 outburst, along with archival photometry from a previous outburst.

Method: The study employed several accretion tracers, including the Ca II triplet, He I, and hydrogen lines from the Paschen and Brackett series, to measure the accretion rate and analyze physical conditions.

Result: The accretion rate was found to be approximately 2.0 times 10 to the power of minus 7 solar masses per year. Analysis of hydrogen lines indicated excitation temperatures of 5000 to 10000 K and electron densities of 10 to the power of 9 to 10 to the power of 10 per cubic centimeter, confirming Gaia23bab as a prototypical EXor.

Abstract: Episodic accretion is a fundamental process in the build-up of the stellar
mass. EX Lupi-type eruptive young stars (EXors) represent one of the main types
of episodic accretion. We study the recently discovered EXor Gaia23bab during
its 2023 outburst. We obtained optical and near-infrared photometry and
spectroscopy to probe the variation of the physical properties of Gaia23bab
during its recent outburst. We also collected archival photometry to study a
previous outburst of the star. We used several accretion tracers, including the
Ca II triplet, He I, and various hydrogen lines from the Paschen and Brackett
series, to measure the accretion rate during the outburst. The accretion rate
is consistent with $\sim 2.0 \times 10^{-7} M_\odot$ $\rm{yr}^{-1}$. Comparing
the line fluxes of the hydrogen Brackett series to predictions of Case B theory
suggests excitation temperatures of 5000 - 10000 K and electron densities of
$10^9$-$10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Comparison to the predictions of a model for T
Tauri stars revealed that the fluxes of the Balmer series are consistent with
temperatures of 5000 - 12500 K and a hydrogen density of $10^8$ cm$^{-3}$,
while the fluxes of the Paschen series are consistent with temperatures in the
range between 10000 and 12500 K and a hydrogen density of $10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$.
The derived temperatures and densities confirm that Gaia23bab is a prototypical
EXor, not only due to its accretion rate, but also based on the best fit
temperatures and densities revealed by the detected hydrogen lines.

Background: 激变变星（CVs）及其周围星云的研究揭示了它们与星际气体云的相互作用，但目前对这类现象的观测和理解仍有限。

Data: 研究使用了Halpha和[O III] 5007波段的观测数据。

Result: 发现LS Pegasi和ASASJ2054周围存在弓形激波星云，且这些星云与星际气体云的相互作用导致重组现象，支持了激变变星紫外和X射线辐射对星云的影响。

Abstract: We report discoveries of bow-shock nebulae, seen in Halpha and [O III] 5007,
around two cataclysmic variables (CVs): LS Pegasi and ASASSN-V
J205457.73+515731.9 (hereafter ASASJ2054). Additionally, both stars lie near
the edges of faint extended Halpha-emitting nebulae. The orientations of the
bow shocks are consistent with the directions of the objects' proper motions.
The properties of LS Peg and ASASJ2054, and of their nebulae, are remarkably
similar to those of SY Cancri, which we described in a recent paper; SY Cnc is
a CV likewise associated with a bow shock and an off-center Halpha nebula.
These objects join V341 Arae and BZ Camelopardalis, CVs that are also
accompanied by similar nebulae. All five stars belong to the nova-like variable
(NLV) subclass of CVs, characterized by luminous optically thick accretion
disks that launch fast winds into the surrounding space. We suggest that the
bow shocks and nebulae result from chance encounters of the NLVs with
interstellar gas clouds, with the stars leaving in their wakes Stromgren zones
that are recombining after being photoionized by the CVs' ultraviolet and X-ray
radiation. Our discoveries illustrate the power of small telescopes equipped
with modern instrumentation, and used to accumulate extremely long exposure
times, for the detection of very low-surface-brightness nebulae.

Background: Blazars是宇宙中最强大的长寿命电磁辐射源，其高能辐射起源模型（轻子与强子）长期存在争议。

Data: 使用了从射电到伽马射线的多波段观测数据，特别是光学和X射线的偏振数据。

Method: 采用了多波段偏振观测方法，包括光学和X射线的偏振测量。

Result: 观测结果显示X射线偏振度低于7.4%，排除了高能辐射的强子起源，支持轻子模型；光学偏振度的显著变化首次被解释为磁‘弹簧’的松弛现象。

Abstract: Blazars, supermassive black hole systems (SMBHs) with highly relativistic
jets aligned with the line of sight, are the most powerful long-lived emitters
of electromagnetic emission in the Universe. We report here on a radio to
gamma-ray multiwavelength campaign on the blazar BL Lacertae with unprecedented
polarimetric coverage from radio to X-ray wavelengths. The observations caught
an extraordinary event on 2023 November 10-18, when the degree of linear
polarization of optical synchrotron radiation reached a record value of 47.5%.
In stark contrast, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) found that the
X-ray (Compton scattering or hadron-induced) emission was polarized at less
than 7.4% (3sigma confidence level). We argue here that this observational
result rules out a hadronic origin of the high energy emission, and strongly
favors a leptonic (Compton scattering) origin, thereby breaking the degeneracy
between hadronic and leptonic emission models for BL Lacertae and demonstrating
the power of multiwavelength polarimetry to address this question. Furthermore,
the multiwavelength flux and polarization variability, featuring an extremely
prominent rise and decay of the optical polarization degree, is interpreted for
the first time by the relaxation of a magnetic "spring" embedded in the newly
injected plasma. This suggests that the plasma jet can maintain a predominant
toroidal magnetic field component parsecs away from the central engine.

**TL;DR**: 研究通过数值模拟分析GSN069和eRO-QPE2的准周期性爆发（QPEs）的长期周期性演化，发现其轨道衰减速率支持太阳型主序星作为轨道天体，而非恒星质量黑洞或裸简并核心。

Background: 准周期性爆发（QPEs）的长期周期性演化机制尚不明确，研究通过假设其由星盘碰撞驱动，探讨了GSN069和eRO-QPE2的轨道衰减速率。

Data: 使用了GSN069和eRO-QPE2的观测数据，包括周期性衰减速率（GSN069为约-3160±720秒每年，eRO-QPE2为约-370±40秒每年）。

Method: 通过数值模拟方法，比较了观测到的周期性衰减速率与不同轨道天体（如恒星质量黑洞、裸简并核心和太阳型主序星）的理论预测。

Result: 研究发现太阳型主序星可能是GSN069和eRO-QPE2的轨道天体，但其表面密度需在特定范围内（如GSN069为3×10^5至2×10^6克每平方厘米，eRO-QPE2为5×10^4至10^6克每平方厘米），且其寿命不超过约12年。

Abstract: We study the secular periodic evolution of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs)
for GSN069 and eRO-QPE2 assuming that they are driven by star-disc collisions.
We set up numerical simulations and compared them with the observed periodic
decay of $\sim -3160\pm720$ s yr$^{-1}$ in GSN069 and $\sim -370\pm40$ s
yr$^{-1}$ in eRO-QPE2. We find that: (1) Stellar mass black holes are unlikely
the orbiters in these two sources, as their periodic decay are on the order of
$<10$ s yr$^{-1}$; (2) A naked degenerate core (including white dwarf) is
unlikely the orbiter in GSN069, as the decay is on the order of $<200$ s
yr$^{-1}$. However, it is possible in eRO-QPE2, although the required surface
density of the accretion disc is relatively high (e.g., $\Sigma\gtrsim10^7\sim
10^8$ g cm$^{-2}$); (3) Both the orbiters in GSN069 and eRO-QPE2 can be
solar-like main-sequence stars (MSs). However, each collision can lead to
gradual ablation of the stellar envelope in the order of $10^{-5}\sim
10^{-3}M_\odot$. To reproduce the observed decay while surviving for $\gtrsim
3$ yr, the surface density of the disc needs to be within a certain range. For
example, given a $1M_\odot$ MS orbiter the surface density of the disc gas
should be in the range of $3\times10^5\sim 2\times10^6$g cm$^{-2}$ for GSN069
or $5\times10^4\sim 10^6$ g cm$^{-2}$ for eRO-QPE2. In both of these two
sources, the MS can not survive for more than $\sim 12$ yr. We expect that
future observations of these two sources can help to distinguish whether the
orbiters are degenerated compact objects or gaseous stars.

Background: 超大质量黑洞双星（SMBHBs）是星系层级合并的晚期阶段产物，但由于被气体和尘埃遮挡，难以探测。X射线和紫外辐射的周期性变化可能成为探测这些系统的关键。

Data: 使用了SRG/eROSITA多历元全天巡天的软X射线（0.2--2.3 keV）光变曲线数据，以及Swift-XRT和NICER的后续监测数据。

Method: 通过搜索光变曲线中的上下起伏模式（up-down-up-down或down-up-down-up），筛选出16个候选体，并利用Swift-XRT和NICER进行后续监测。光学光谱观测用于确认核区和星系外性质。

Result: 发现16个候选体，其中15个被确认为核区或星系外天体，最有望的候选体eRASSt J0530-4125表现出一年周期的X射线准周期性变化。估计SMBHB候选体在星系中的比例上限约为0.05。

Abstract: Abridged: Supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) separated by (sub)-pc
scales represent one of the latest stages of hierarchical galaxy assembly.
However, many of these objects are hidden behind large columns of gas and dust
at the center of galaxies and are difficult to detect. The X-ray and UV
emission in these systems are predicted to vary regularly on timescales
comparable to that of the orbital period of the binary. This is the first of a
series of papers where we aim to find SMBHB candidates based on quasi-periodic
light curves from the soft X-ray instrument eROSITA on board the
Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory and X-ray follow-up. We searched the
multi-epoch SRG/eROSITA all-sky surveys for extragalactic sources that show an
`up-down-up-down' or `down-up-down-up' profile (from scan to scan) in their
0.2--2.3 keV flux light curves. We compiled a sample of 16 sources that are
suitable for X-ray follow-up campaigns given their brightness and significant
variability between bright and faint SRG/eROSITA flux levels. We triggered
extensive Swift-XRT and NICER monitoring campaigns on the best SMBHB candidates
to confirm or discard their tentative periodicities. Optical spectroscopic
observations confirmed the nuclear and extragalactic nature of 15/16 objects
and enabled single-epoch SMBH mass measurements and BPT classifications. Our
most promising candidate, eRASSt J0530-4125, shows X-ray quasi-periodic
variability with a typical time scale of one year in the observed frame. By
stacking the X-ray observations of each source in our sample, we find that
14/15 sources can be modeled by a power law with a photon index ranging from
$\Gamma\sim1.8-2.8$. Based on our selection, we estimate an optimistic upper
limit on the fraction of SMBHB candidates to be $\sim 0.05$ per galaxy. We
emphasize that further observational evidence is needed to confirm the SMBHB
nature of our sources.
