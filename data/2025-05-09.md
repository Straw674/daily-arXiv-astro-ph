### [1] [A data-driven approach for star formation parameterization using symbolic regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04681)
*Diane M. Salim,Matthew E. Orr,Blakesley Burkhart,Rachel S. Somerville,Miles Cramner*

**TL;DR**: 本研究利用机器学习和符号回归技术，基于FIRE-2模拟数据，首次提出了数据驱动的恒星形成率解析表达式，揭示了气体密度、速度弥散和恒星密度对恒星形成的关键影响。

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 恒星形成（SF）是理解星系演化和行星形成的基础，但目前开发能够将恒星形成与关键物理变量（如气体密度和湍流）联系起来的解析表达式仍具挑战性。

Data: 使用了公开的FIRE-2模拟套件中的数据。

Method: 采用了基于机器学习的符号回归（SR）技术，使用PySR软件包中的遗传算法训练管道，结合自定义损失函数和模型选择技术，从FIRE-2星系中提取的八个变量中推导恒星形成率的解析表达式。

Result: 研究发现，恒星形成率的最佳解析表达式包含气体表面密度、气体速度弥散和恒星表面密度；在较长时间尺度上，这些表达式收敛为类似标度关系的方程，并能够捕捉Kennicutt-Schmidt平面内的物理散射。

Abstract: Star formation (SF) in the interstellar medium (ISM) is fundamental to
understanding galaxy evolution and planet formation. However, efforts to
develop closed-form analytic expressions that link SF with key influencing
physical variables, such as gas density and turbulence, remain challenging. In
this work, we leverage recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and use
symbolic regression (SR) techniques to produce the first data-driven,
ML-discovered analytic expressions for SF using the publicly available FIRE-2
simulation suites. Employing a pipeline based on training the genetic algorithm
of SR from an open software package called PySR, in tandem with a custom loss
function and a model selection technique which compares candidate equations to
analytic approaches to describing SF, we produce symbolic representations of a
predictive model for the star formation rate surface density
($\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$) averaged over both 10 Myr and 100 Myr based on eight
extracted variables from FIRE-2 galaxies. The resulting model that PySR finds
best describes SF, on both averaging timescales, features equations that
incorporates the surface density of gas, $\Sigma_\mathrm{gas}$, the velocity
dispersion of gas $\sigma_{\mathrm{gas,~z}}$ and the surface density of stars
$\Sigma_\mathrm{*}$. Furthermore, we find that the equations found for the
longer SFR timescale all converge to a scaling-relation-like equation, all of
which also closely capture the intrinsic physical scatter of the data within
the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) plane. This observed convergence to physically
interpretable scaling relations at longer SFR timescales demonstrates that our
method successfully identifies robust physical relationships rather than
fitting to stochastic fluctuations.

### [2] [The Impact of Early Massive Galaxy Formation on the Cosmic Microwave Background](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04687)
*Eda Gjergo,Pavel Kroupa*

**TL;DR**: The study highlights the significant impact of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) on Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) foreground contamination, suggesting their formation around redshift 15-20 and accounting for up to 1.4% of the CMB energy density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies are fundamental to cosmology and the Big Bang model, but the formation of massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) has been overlooked as a foreground component. Recent JWST observations of massive, evolved systems at extreme redshifts (z > 13) and constraints from chemical evolution emphasize the rapid formation of massive ETGs, requiring intense star formation and a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF).

Data: The study uses constraints from chemical evolution, stellar population synthesis models, and the integrated galaxy-wide IMF (IGIMF) theory to analyze massive ETGs.

Method: The research incorporates the properties of massive ETGs in a flat-LCDM cosmological context, utilizing the IGIMF theory to model their formation and evolution without relying on CMB priors or constraints.

Result: The findings indicate that massive ETGs formed around redshift 15-20 and contribute significantly to CMB foreground contamination, accounting for 1.4% to the full present-day CMB energy density.

Abstract: The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, corrected for foreground
effects, form the foundation of cosmology and support the Big Bang model. A
previously overlooked foreground component is the formation of massive
early-type galaxies (ETGs), which can no longer be ignored, particularly in
light of JWST's detection of massive, evolved systems at extreme redshifts (z >
13). The rapid formation of massive ETGs has been advocated in galaxy evolution
studies for decades, and recent evidence has compelled even proponents of
hierarchical mass assembly to acknowledge the fact that massive ETGs evolve
quickly. Constraints from chemical evolution are particularly stringent.
Without both intense star formation and a top-heavy galaxy-wide initial mass
function of stars (IMF), it is difficult to reconcile stellar population
synthesis models with the high metallicity and abundance patterns of alpha
elements. We infer from previous studies that the progenitor cloud of each
massive ETG must have had a radius of approximately 400 kpc. Comparing this
value to the average present-day separation of massive ETGs, their formation
may have occurred around 15 < z < 20. We consider this epoch of formation in a
flat-LCDM cosmological context, incorporating the known and necessary
properties of massive ETGs. Such properties are encapsulated independently by
the integrated galaxy-wide IMF (IGIMF) theory. The massive ETG evolution
presented in this work is consistent with recent advancements in stellar and
galaxy evolution, and is derived entirely without priors or constraints from
the CMB. Yet, it emerges as a non-negligible source of CMB foreground
contamination. Even in our most conservative estimates, massive ETGs account
for 1.4% up to the full present-day CMB energy density.

**TL;DR**: 利用MUSE积分场光谱分析了NGC 253外流中Hα发射电离气体的动力学和物理特性，揭示了最大外流速度、电子密度分布及质量外流率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: NGC 253外流中的电离气体动力学和物理特性研究对于理解星系外流机制及其对星系演化的影响具有重要意义。

Data: 使用了Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE)的积分场光谱数据，分析了Hα、[N II]和[S II]发射线。

Method: 在每个空间像素中，将Hα、[N II]和[S II]发射线分解为最多3个高斯分量，考虑了盘和流出锥壁的速度贡献。

Result: 在南部外流瓣中，最大去投影外流速度达到约-500 km/s，电子密度在核附近峰值达2100 cm^-3，质量外流率为0.4 M⊙/年，质量加载因子η约为0.1，恒星爆发能量效率约为2%。

Abstract: We present an analysis of the H$\alpha$-emitting ionized gas in the warm
phase of the NGC 253 outflow using integral field spectroscopy from the Multi
Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). In each spaxel, we decompose H$\alpha$, [N
II], and [S II] emission lines into a system of up to 3 Gaussian components,
accounting for the velocity contributions due to the disk and both intercepted
walls of an outflow cone. In the approaching southern lobe of the outflow, we
find maximum deprojected outflow velocities down to ~ -500 km/s. Velocity
gradients of this outflowing gas range from ~ -350 to -550 km/s/kpc with
increasing distance from the nucleus. Additionally, [N II]/H$\alpha$ and [S
II]/H$\alpha$ integrated line ratios are suggestive of shocks as the dominant
ionization source throughout the wind. Electron densities, inferred from the [S
II] doublet, peak at 2100 cm$^{-3}$ near the nucleus and reach $\lesssim 50
$cm$^{-3}$ in the wind. Finally, at an uncertainty of 0.3 dex on the inferred
mass of $4\times10^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$, the mass-outflow rate of the
H$\alpha$-emitting gas in the southern outflow lobe is ~ 0.4 M$_{\odot}$/year.
This yields a mass-loading factor of $\eta$ ~ 0.1 and a ~ 2% starburst energy
efficiency.

**TL;DR**: JWST发现了一批在再电离时期被轻度遮蔽的低光度活动星系核，这些天体可能是连接遮蔽类星体和经典非遮蔽类星体的桥梁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜（JWST）的高灵敏度揭示了再电离时期（EoR）中存在大量被轻度遮蔽的低光度活动星系核（AGNs），但这些天体与经典非遮蔽类星体之间的联系尚不明确。

Data: 研究使用了JWST/NIRSpec的后续观测数据，分析了13个最初从紫外成像调查中选出的天体，这些天体具有高光度（>10^43 erg s^-1）的窄Lyα发射线。

Method: 通过JWST/NIRSpec的后续观测，研究人员检测了这些天体在H I Balmer线和He I线中的宽成分，并利用Balmer递减推断出轻度尘埃遮蔽（0 < A_V < 3）。

Result: 研究发现这些宽线天体可能是再电离时期被遮蔽的高光度类星体的对应物，其超大质量黑洞（SMBHs）质量在10^7.8-9.1 M⊙之间，且处于亚爱丁顿到爱丁顿吸积状态。AGN的密度估计为大于2×10^-8 Mpc^-3，表明在再电离时期有大量活动SMBHs被遮蔽且被过去的紫外调查忽略。

Abstract: The unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has
uncovered a surprisingly abundant population of mildly obscured, low-luminosity
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the epoch of reionization (EoR). However, the
link between these objects and classical unobscured quasars remains a mystery.
Here we report the discovery of obscured quasars hosted by the most luminous
galaxies at $z > 6$, possibly bridging the gap between the two AGN populations.
The 13 objects presented here were originally selected from a rest-frame
ultraviolet (UV) imaging survey over $>$1000 deg$^2$, and were known to have
luminous ($>10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$) narrow Ly$\alpha$ emission. With
JWST/NIRSpec follow-up observations, we found that nine of them exhibit a broad
component in H I Balmer lines and He I lines, but not in [O III] and other
forbidden lines. Mild dust obscuration ($0 < A_V < 3$) is inferred from the
Balmer decrements. The estimated intrinsic luminosities suggest that our broad
line (BL) objects are the long-sought UV-obscured counterparts of luminous
quasars in the EoR. They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses
$10^{7.8 - 9.1} M_\odot$, undergoing sub-Eddington to Eddington accretion. Most
of the BL objects are spatially unresolved, and are close to "little red dots"
with their blue rest-UV and red rest-optical colors. We estimate the AGN number
density among similarly luminous Ly$\alpha$ emitters to be larger than $2
\times 10^{-8}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. This density is comparable to that of classical
quasars with similar continuum luminosities, suggesting that a substantial
fraction of active SMBHs are obscured in the EoR and have been overlooked in
past rest-UV surveys.

**TL;DR**: 本文通过Chandra X射线观测和JWST-NIRSpec光谱分析，研究了四个z~6的窄线类星体候选体，发现它们具有X射线静默和弱宽巴尔默发射的特征，可能由光学厚遮蔽物质或超临界吸积流中的膨胀盘引起。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 窄线类星体候选体在z~6时具有窄（FWHM<310 km/s）、高亮度（>1e44 erg/s）的Lya发射和微弱的UV连续谱（M_1450 = -22 - -21），这促使研究者探讨它们是否在再电离时期被遮蔽的明亮活动星系核（AGN）。

Data: 研究使用了Chandra X射线观测数据和JWST-NIRSpec的光谱数据。

Method: 通过Chandra X射线观测和JWST-NIRSpec光谱分析，结合低红移AGN的比例关系，研究了这些候选体的X射线静默和光学特征。

Result: 这些候选体未被Chandra探测到，X射线亮度上限为2e44 erg/s（2 sigma），光学光谱显示弱宽巴尔默发射，可能与光学厚遮蔽物质或超临界吸积流中的膨胀盘有关。

Abstract: We report on Chandra X-ray observations of four narrow-line quasar candidates
at z~6, selected from the SHELLQs project, based on the Subaru Hyper
Suprime-Cam survey. These objects are characterised by narrow (FWHM<310 km/s),
luminous (>1e44 erg/s) Lya and faint UV continuum (M_1450 = -22 - -21),
prompting us to examine whether they are obscured luminous AGN at the epoch of
reionization. However, none of these objects were detected by Chandra, giving
an upper limit to their rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosity (Lx) of 2e44 erg/s (2
sigma), assuming a spectral slope Gamma=2. Subsequent rest-frame optical
spectroscopy of these objects by the JWST-NIRSpec, presented in a companion
paper, show weak broad Balmer emission at the base of narrow cores. With the
scaling relation for low-redshift AGN, the observed strong [OIII]5007 flux of
these sources would predict Lx to be around 1e45 erg/s, which is well above the
Chandra upper limits. These optical spectra and X-ray quietness are reminiscent
of JWST-selected broad-line AGN. We attribute the weak broad Balmer emission to
the broad-line regions hidden partially by optically-thick obscuring matter
which also hides the optical and X-ray continuum emission from the accretion
disc. Compton-thick obscuration, which would strongly suppress X-ray emission,
could be due to a dense inter-stellar medium that is often present in galaxies
at high redshifts. Alternatively, the same effect could be obtained from an
inflated disc at the innermost radii in a supercritical accretion flow, when
the disc is viewed at inclined angles.

Abstract: We present the results of our pipeline for discovering strong gravitational
lenses in the ongoing Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey
(UNIONS). We successfully train the deep residual neural network (ResNet) based
on CMU-Deeplens architecture, which is designed to detect strong lenses in
ground-based imaging surveys. We train on images of real strong lenses and
deploy on a sample of 8 million galaxies in areas with full coverage in the g,
r, and i filters, the first multi-band search for strong gravitational lenses
in UNIONS. Following human inspection and grading, we report the discovery of a
total of 1346 new strong lens candidates of which 146 are grade A, 199 grade B,
and 1001 grade C. Of these candidates, 283 have lens-galaxy spectroscopic
redshifts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and an additional 297 from
the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 (DR1). We find
15 of these systems display evidence of both lens and source galaxy redshifts
in spectral superposition. We additionally report the spectroscopic
confirmation of seven lensed sources in highquality systems, all with z > 2.1,
using the Keck Near-Infrared Echelle Spectrograph (NIRES) and Gemini

Background: 詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜发现了一类具有强宽Hα发射的致密源，通常被认为是低光度宽线（Type 1）活动星系核（BLAGN）。这些观测结果是否与星系形成模型存在冲突是一个重要问题。

Result: 在合理选择参数的情况下，FLARES能够复现z=5时的Hα光度函数和等效宽度分布的观测约束。

Abstract: One of the most remarkable results from the \emph{James Webb Space Telescope}
has been the discovery of a large population of compact sources exhibiting
strong broad H$\alpha$ emission, typically interpreted to be low-luminosity
broad-line (Type 1) active galactic nuclei (BLAGN). An important question is
whether these observations are in tension with galaxy formation models, and if
so how? While comparisons have been made using physical properties (i.e.~black
hole mass and accretion rate) inferred from observations, these require the use
of SED modelling assumptions, or locally inferred scaling relations, which may
be unjustified, at least in the distant high-redshift Universe. In this work we
take an alternative approach and forward model predictions from the First Light
And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) suite of cosmological
hydrodynamical zoom simulations to predict the observable properties of BLAGN.
We achieve this by first coupling \flares\ with the \qsosed\ model to predict
the ionising photon luminosities of high-redshift ($z>5$) AGN. To model the
observed broad H$\alpha$ emission we then assume a constant conversion factor
and covering fraction, and the fraction of AGN that have observable
broad-lines. With a reasonable choice of these parameters, \flares\ is able to
reproduce observational constraints on the H$\alpha$ luminosity function and
equivalent width distribution at $z=5$.

Background: 研究旨在理解NGC 1068中心活动星系核（AGN）的燃料机制及其能量输出对周围分子气体的影响，填补了高分辨率观测数据的空白。

Data: 使用了HCO+4->3和CO 3->2分子线的高角分辨率和光谱分辨率ALMA观测数据。

Method: 通过分析矩图、位置-速度（PV）图和核连续源位置的光谱，并结合3DBarolo软件开发的简单运动学模型进行研究。

Result: 观测揭示了核盘东西两侧在形态、速度和线强度上的显著不对称性，并发现低速度连接延伸至13 pc，表明与更大尺度结构的相互作用；核区的CO/HCO+线比率极低。

Abstract: We dissect the kinematics and morphology of the molecular gas within the
near-nuclear region of NGC 1068 to understand the mechanisms in the central AGN
that might be fueling it, and the impact of its energy output on the
surrounding molecular gas. We present high angular and spectral resolution ALMA
observations of the HCO$^+$4->3 and CO 3->2 molecular lines in the near-nuclear
region of the prototype Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068. The spatial resolution
(1.1~pc) is almost two times better than that of previous works studying the
same molecular lines at the same transitions and is the highest resolution
achievable with ALMA at these frequencies. Our analysis focuses on moment maps,
position-velocity (PV) diagrams, and spectra obtained at the position of the
nuclear continuum source, along with a simple kinematic model developed using
the 3DBarolo software. Our observations reveal significant asymmetry between
the eastern and western sides of the nuclear disc in terms of morphology,
velocity, and line intensity. The broad lines seen in the inner 2 pc could be
accounted for by either beam smearing or highly turbulent gas in this region.
Outside this radius the mean velocities drop to $\pm$30 km/s, which cannot be
explained by asymmetric drift. We find low velocity connections extending to 13
pc suggesting interactions with larger scale structures. The CO/HCO$^+$ line
ratio at the nucleus reported here are extremely low compared to values in the
literature of the same galaxy at lower spatial resolutions.

**TL;DR**: 通过引入密度调制恒星形成效率（DMSFE）的模型，结合尘埃和爆发性恒星形成的影响，研究成功解释了詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜在超高红移（z≳10）观测到的紫外发光星系数量密度的异常现象。

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜在超高红移（z≳10）观测到的紫外发光星系数量密度比基于低红移观测或发射前物理模型的预测更高且随红移增加下降更慢，现有模型假设的恒星形成效率（SFE）仅为几个百分点，与附近星系的观测结果一致。

Data: 研究使用了詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜在超高红移（z≳10）观测到的紫外发光星系数据。

Method: 研究将密度调制恒星形成效率（DMSFE）引入半解析宇宙学模型（SAM），并模拟了尘埃和爆发性恒星形成对星系观测特性的影响。

Result: 新模型在合理参数（如致密气体比例f_dense）下能够重现甚至超过红移z∼6-17的星系数量密度观测值，但单一f_dense值无法解释z≳12时星系数量密度的缓慢下降，可能需要f_dense随宇宙时间变化。

Abstract: The number density of UV luminous galaxies discovered by the James Webb Space
Telescope at ultra high redshift ($z \gtrsim 10$) is higher, and declines much
more slowly with increasing redshift, than expected from extrapolations of
lower redshift observations or pre-launch physics-based models. Most of these
models assume star formation efficiencies (SFE) of only a few percent,
motivated by observations of nearby galaxies. In this work, we incorporate a
scaling of SFE with gas surface density (which we refer to as Density Modulated
SFE; DMSFE), motivated by cloud-scale simulations and theory, into a
semi-analytic cosmological model (SAM) of galaxy formation which is calibrated
to match the observed rest-UV sizes of high redshift galaxies. We also model
the impact of dust and bursty star formation on the SAM-predicted properties of
observed galaxies. We show that with plausible values of the main parameters,
such as the fraction of gas in dense clouds $f_{\rm dense}$, our new models
easily reproduce or even exceed the observed galaxy number densities at $z\sim
6$-17. While no single value of $f_{\rm dense}$ is able to reproduce the very
shallow observed decline of the galaxy number density at $z\gtrsim 12$, it is
plausible and even expected for $f_{\rm dense}$ to have some effective
dependence on cosmic time, which could bring these models into closer agreement
with the data. We show that the combined effects of DMSFE, decreasing dust
attenuation, and increasingly bursty star formation at earlier cosmic epochs
could conspire to reproduce the observed evolution.

**TL;DR**: 利用Gaia DR3 XP光谱首次对500 pc内的年轻恒星天体（YSOs）进行了全天均匀分析，揭示了低吸积YSOs的广泛分布及其与恒星形成区域的空间关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 原行星盘对形成中恒星的吸积率是恒星形成和原行星盘演化的关键因素。以往研究通过光谱和窄带测光对单个恒星形成区域进行了广泛调查，但缺乏全天均匀的分析。

Data: 使用了Gaia DR3 XP光谱和Hα伪等效宽度数据，分析了145,975个候选YSOs的Hα发射线。

Method: 通过Hα伪等效宽度和XP光谱表征YSOs的Hα发射线，推导了吸积光度、质量吸积率和恒星参数。

Result: 发现了一个未被先前调查发现的低吸积YSOs群体，其空间分布分散，远离恒星形成区域；确定了吸积光度与恒星光度、质量吸积率与恒星质量的关系；并拟合了Sco-Cen复合体中不同年龄星团的吸积恒星比例，得出吸积时间尺度为2.7±0.4 Myr。

Abstract: Accretion rates from protoplanetary disks onto forming stars are a key
ingredient in star formation and protoplanetary disk evolution. Extensive
efforts surveying individual star forming regions with spectroscopy and
narrow-band photometry have been performed to derive accretion rates on large
populations of young stellar objects (YSOs). We use Gaia DR3 XP spectra to
perform the first all-sky homogeneous analysis of YSO accretion within 500 pc.
We characterise the H$\alpha$ line emission of YSOs by using the H$\alpha$
pseudo-equivalent widths and XP spectra from Gaia DR3. We derive accretion
luminosities, mass accretion rates and stellar parameters for 145 975 candidate
YSO H$\alpha$ emitters all-sky. We describe filtering strategies to select
specific sub-samples of YSOs from this catalogue. We identify a large
population of low-accreting YSO candidates untraced by previous surveys. The
population of low accreting YSOs is mostly spatially dispersed, away from star
forming regions or more clustered environments of star formation. Many YSOs
appear disconnected from young populations, reminiscent of 'Peter Pan' YSOs. We
find $L_{acc}\propto L_\star^{1.41\pm0.02}$ and $\dot M_{acc}\propto
M_\star^{2.4\pm0.1}$ for the purest all-sky sample of YSO candidates. By
fitting an exponential to the fraction of accreting stars in clusters of
different ages in the Sco-Cen complex, we obtain an accretion timescale of
2.7$\pm$0.4 Myr. The percentage of accretors found by fitting a power-law is
70% at 2 Myr and 2.8% at 10 Myr. With this new catalogue of H$\alpha$ emitters
we significantly increase the number of YSO candidates with accretion rate
estimations in the local neighbourhood. This allows us to study accretion
timescales and the spatial and physical properties of YSO accretion from a
large, all-sky, and homogeneous sample for the first time. [abridged]

Abstract: Metal-poor stars are a rare and ancient type of stars; Carbon-Enhanced
Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars are a subset of these celestial bodies that show an
enrichment of carbon relative to iron. They are believed to be formed from gas
polluted by the first generation of stars after the Big Bang and are important
objects for studying the early universe, galaxy evolution, and nucleosynthesis.
Due to their rarity, the search for metal-poor stars and CEMP stars is a
valuable task. This study investigates the search for CEMP stars based on the
low-resolution stellar spectra from LAMOST DR8, and proposes a deep learning
scheme. From the LAMOST DR8 spectral library, this work discovered 12,766 CEMP
star candidates. For ease of reference and use, we provide the estimated
parameters $T_\texttt{eff}$, $\log~g$, [Fe/H] and [C/H] for them.

Abstract: We design an uncertainty-aware cost-sensitive neural network (UA-CSNet) to
estimate metallicities from dereddened and corrected Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra
for giant stars. This method accounts for both stochastic errors in the input
spectra and the imbalanced density distribution in [Fe/H] values. With a
specialized architecture and training strategy, the UA-CSNet improves the
precision of the predicted metallicities, especially for very metal-poor (VMP;
$\rm [Fe/H] \leq -2.0$) stars. With the PASTEL catalog as the training sample,
our model can estimate metallicities down to $\rm [Fe/H] \sim -4$. We compare
our estimates with a number of external catalogs and conduct tests using star
clusters, finding overall good agreement. We also confirm that our estimates
for VMP stars are unaffected by carbon enhancement. Applying the UA-CSNet, we
obtain reliable and precise metallicity estimates for approximately 20 million
giant stars, including 360,000 VMP stars and 50,000 extremely metal-poor (EMP;
$\rm [Fe/H] \leq -3.0$) stars. The resulting catalog is publicly available at
https://doi.org/10.12149/101604. This work highlights the potential of
low-resolution spectra for metallicity estimation and provides a valuable
dataset for studying the formation and chemo-dynamical evolution of our Galaxy.

**TL;DR**: 本研究结合AKARI和Spitzer太空望远镜的红外数据，分析了四颗原恒星的中红外光谱，通过全局拟合方法识别了冰成分的吸收特征，并比较了不同演化阶段原恒星中冰的丰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 原恒星的中红外光谱分析是研究星际冰成分的重要手段，但目前对冰吸收特征的分解和识别仍存在挑战。

Data: 使用了AKARI和Spitzer太空望远镜获取的2.5-30微米范围内的红外光谱数据。

Method: 通过连续谱确定和硅酸盐吸收扣除方法处理光谱，并采用全局拟合方法结合实验冰吸收数据识别冰成分。

Result: 成功识别了H2O、NH3、CH3OH、CO2和CO等冰成分的吸收特征，并比较了不同演化阶段原恒星中冰的丰度，还探索了有机冰物种的可能吸收。

Abstract: We present the combined 2.5$-$30$\mu$m spectra of four protostars acquired
with the infrared camera and the infrared spectrograph on board the AKARI and
Spitzer space telescopes, respectively. To analyze the ice absorption features
in the 8$-$22$\mu$m, we first performed a continuum determination process on
mid-infrared spectra and applied a method to subtract the silicate absorption.
We conducted a global fitting process to the absorption features in the
combined infrared spectra using the experimental ice absorbance data to
identify the intrinsic absorption of each ice component. We first derived the
H$_{2}$O ice column densities of both stretch and libration modes at 3.05$\mu$m
and 13.6$\mu$m simultaneously. We also identified the absorption features
containing NH$_{3}$, CH$_{3}$OH, CO$_{2}$, and CO and decomposed their mixed
components and compared their ice abundances at different evolutionary stages
of the protostars. We explored possible absorptions of the organic ice species
such as HCOOH, CH$_{3}$CHO, and CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$OH in the mid-infrared ranges.
The ice analysis method developed in this study can be applied to the ice
spectra obtained by the James Webb Space Telescope.

### [14] [Cluster Lensing Mass Inversion (CLUMI+): Combining Dynamics and Weak Lensing around Galaxy Clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04694)
*Keiichi Umetsu,Michele Pizzardo,Antonaldo Diaferio,Margaret J. Geller*

**TL;DR**: CLUMI+是一种结合引力透镜和动力学观测的多探针方法，用于重建星系团及其周围的质量分布，无需依赖平衡假设，并在大半径范围内提高了精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系团质量分布的重建通常依赖于引力透镜和动力学观测，但现有方法在平衡假设和精度方面存在局限性。

Data: 使用了来自IllustrisTNG模拟的合成弱透镜和相空间数据，以及Abell 2261的Subaru和哈勃太空望远镜的弱+强透镜数据与Hectospec Cluster Survey的光谱测量数据。

Method: CLUMI+方法结合了弱透镜剪切和放大数据与星系团流入区域的投影逃逸速度测量，通过分段定义的收敛剖面和投影幂律形式建模质量分布，并整合了强透镜约束。

Result: CLUMI+在模拟数据中实现了无偏的投影和三维质量剖面重建，并在大半径范围内提高了10%--30%的精度，应用于Abell 2261时展示了多探针建模的稳健性。

Abstract: We present CLUMI+, a self-consistent, multi-probe methodology for
reconstructing the mass distribution in and around galaxy clusters by combining
gravitational lensing and dynamical observations. Building on the
joint-likelihood framework of Umetsu (2013), CLUMI+ integrates weak-lensing
shear and magnification data with projected escape velocity measurements in the
cluster infall region, yielding tighter constraints on the gravitational
potential without relying on equilibrium assumptions. The mass distribution is
modeled using a flexible, piecewise-defined convergence profile that
characterizes the azimuthally averaged surface mass density within the lensing
field, transitioning to a projected power-law form at larger radii where
phase-space constraints complement lensing. Additional strong-lensing
constraints are incorporated via central aperture-mass measurements, enabling
full-scale mass reconstruction from the cluster core to the outskirts. We
validate CLUMI+ using synthetic weak-lensing and phase-space data for a massive
cluster from the IllustrisTNG simulations, demonstrating unbiased recovery of
projected and three-dimensional mass profiles and achieving 10%--30%
improvement in precision at large radii. As a case study, we apply CLUMI+ to
Abell 2261, combining Subaru and Hubble Space Telescope weak+strong lensing
data with spectroscopic measurements from the Hectospec Cluster Survey. This
analysis demonstrates the power of multi-probe, equilibrium-free modeling for
robust cluster mass reconstruction.

Background: 合并星系团中的射电晕是由湍流加速宇宙射线形成的，已知这些星系团中存在Mpc尺度的射电晕，但对其外围区域的了解有限。

Data: 高频射电观测数据，包括PLCK G287.0+32.9、Abell 2744和Bullet三个合并星系团的数据，并与MACS J0717+3745和Abell 2142的数据进行比较。

Result: 研究发现射电晕可以延伸至星系团外围，且其性质与经典射电晕相似，但需注意无关源的精确扣除以避免外围区域的虚假次级成分。

Abstract: We present new, high frequency radio observations of the merging galaxy
clusters PLCK G287.0+32.9, Abell 2744, and Bullet. These clusters are known to
host $\sim$Mpc scale sources, known as radio halos, which are formed by the
acceleration of cosmic rays by turbulence injected into the intracluster medium
during cluster mergers. Our new images reveal previously undetected faint
outermost regions of halos, extending to over 2 Mpc. This discovery highlights
the presence of radio halos with large extents at high frequencies and suggests
that their observable size depends on a combination of the observation
sensitivity and uv-coverage, and their radio power. We additionally compare the
properties of these three clusters with MACS J0717+3745 and Abell 2142, both of
which are known to host prominent large radio halos. Remarkably, all five
halos, despite their exceptionally large extents, exhibit properties similar to
other classical halos: their radial profiles are described by a
single-component exponential fit, they show radial spectral index steepening,
and have an average radio emissivity of about $10^{-42}\,
\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-3}\,Hz^{-1}}$. Our results demonstrate that radio
halos can extend to the cluster periphery, without the transition to an
observationally distinguishable different halo component in the outermost
regions. Our findings highlight that careful subtraction of unrelated sources
embedded in the halo is necessary to measure the radio surface brightness
accurately, as incomplete subtraction can introduce an apparent secondary
component in the peripheral regions.

Abstract: Little red dots (LRDs) are a newly identified class of broad-line active
galactic nuclei (AGN) with a distinctive v-shape spectrum characterized by red
optical and blue UV continuum emission. Their high abundance at redshifts of
$z\sim6-8$ and decline at lower redshifts suggest a transient origin. We
propose that the spectral shape of LRDs originates from compact binary black
hole systems, where each black hole is surrounded by a mini-disk and embedded
in a larger circum-binary disk. With a binary separation of $\lesssim 10^3$
Schwarzschild radii, the Wien tail of a $T\simeq 5000~{\rm K}$ blackbody
spectrum at the inner edge of the circum-binary disk produces the red optical
emission, while the mini-disks power the UV continuum. Binary torques carve out
a gap between the circum-binary disk and mini-disks, setting the turnover
wavelength of the v-shaped spectrum around the Balmer limit. This scenario
naturally reproduces LRD spectra requiring only modest dust attenuation
($A_V\lesssim 1$ mag), resolving overestimated luminosities for LRDs in
previous studies and alleviating a tension with the so-called Soltan argument.
This model predicts a distinct spectral evolution as the binary orbit decays
through binary-disk interactions and gravitational waves (GWs), linking
early-stage "proto-LRD" binaries to the broader AGN population and late-stage
"LRD-descendants" to coalescing binaries detectable in GW experiments.
