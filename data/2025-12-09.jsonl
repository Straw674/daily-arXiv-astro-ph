In radio astronomy, Fast Imaging Pipeline (FIP) addresses this need by reconstructing radio astronomical images and identifying candidates statistically. The FIP comprises imaging and localisation components but conventional radio astronomical imagers, optimised for longer integrations, limit its efficiency. To overcome this limitation, a Transient-Oriented Imager (TOI) is developed based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and parallelised on NVIDIA GPUs using CUDA. Integrating the TOI with an advanced transient detector, FITrig, forms the FIP-TOI enabling real-time and high-precision localisation of pulsar candidates. For 4K x 4K-pixel images, FIP-TOI accelerates localisation by roughly tenfold compared to a pipeline using the standard imager WSClean. Testing on diverse datasets -- including fields with multiple pulsars, an on-and-off pulsar, and a pulsar exhibiting intensity changes -- FIP-TOI demonstrates robust performance across all scenarios."}

While the narrow line widths are consistent with the formal definition of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies, the broader accretion and emission properties reveal key distinctions. The sample exhibits sub-Eddington accretion rates (median $\\log R_{Edd} \\approx -0.68$) and comparatively weak FeII emission (median $R_{FeII} \\approx 0.61$), in contrast to the strong FeII strengths and high Eddington ratios characteristic of classical NLSy1s. Optical variability amplitudes, derived from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves, are similar to those typically seen in Seyfert 1 galaxies, with a median $\\log(σ) \\approx -0.68$, suggesting the AGN component's significant contribution to variability. In the optical plane of the 4D Eigenvector 1 (4DE1) parameter space, these sources occupy a distinct locus in the low-$R_{FeII}$, low-$R_{Edd}$ regime, suggesting a physically distinct accretion state.

Lyman-alpha emission in the EoR is strongly shaped by resonant absorption from neutral hydrogen in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM), which transforms galactic sources into a low surface-brightness background. In this work, we leverage the state-of-the-art THESAN cosmological simulations to produce high-resolution theoretical predictions for future Lyman-alpha LIM studies, constructing continuous light cones for line-of-sight cosmological integrations. We assess the contributions of recombination, collisional excitation, and unresolved HII regions to the total Lyman-alpha spectral intensity. In addition, we explore the IGM in absorption at different redshifts using damping wing analysis. We produce channel maps exploring spatial fluctuations across redshift bands probe-able by LIM instruments. We find that the slope of the absorption-included Lyman-alpha fluctuation power spectrum at smaller scales (k > 10^(-2) 1/arcsec) steepens toward lower redshift, and that our emission-only Lyman-alpha power spectrum lies above the SPHEREx sensitivity, whereas the absorption-included signal is ~4 orders of magnitude lower--providing a conservative lower limit on inhomogeneity signatures and highlighting the importance of including resonant scattering in our model in the future. We also find that including outflows in a simple toy model boosts power by four orders of magnitude. We identify limitations in our analysis and propose next steps, including incorporating the effects of resonant Lyman-alpha scattering and line interlopers, as well as larger simulation volumes."}

Using the GLEAM-X Dec = 1.6 degree pointing, which is stationary in azimuth (on the local Meridian) and elevation (near the celestial Equator), the very wide field of view of the MWA maintains custody of a large number of satellites in geostationary and geosynchronous (GEO) orbits in this direction for long periods of time. We use one night of GLEAM-X data in the 72 - 231 MHz frequency range to form stacked images at the predicted coordinates of up to 162 such satellites, in order to search for unintended radio emission. In the majority of cases, we reach 4 sigma upper limits of better than 1 mW Equivalent Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) in a 30.72 MHz bandwidth (dual polarisation), with the best limits below 10 uW. No convincing evidence for unintended emissions at these detection thresholds was found. This study builds on recent work showing an increasing prevalence of unintended emissions from satellites in LEO. Any such emission from objects in GEO could be a significant contributor to radio frequency interference experienced by the low frequency Square Kilometre Array and warrants monitoring. The current study forms a baseline for comparisons to future monitoring."}

All three simulations reproduce the strong observed trend that lower-mass satellites are more likely to be quenched, closely matching the stellar-mass dependence seen in SAGA, ELVES, and the MW+M31 system. This agreement indicates that the mass dependence of satellite quenching is a robust outcome of contemporary galaxy formation models. Radial trends, however, show meaningful differences. SAGA and ELVES exhibit gently declining quenched fractions with projected distance, reflecting strong environmental quenching at small radii. TNG50 most closely matches this behavior, FIREbox, remains consistent with with a nearly flat trend within uncertainties, and the FIRE-2 zoom-ins show suppressed inner quenched fractions driven almost entirely by their paired MW-M31 hosts, which lack high-mass satellites and show strong radial segregation between star-forming and quenched systems. This environmental imprint suggests that host environment and assembly history can influence satellite quenching outcomes and may contribute to diversity across simulations. Overall, while the simulations consistently recover the stellar-mass dependence of quenching their radial trends vary, highlighting the influence of host-halo conditions and motivating deeper exploration of how host environments shape satellite quenching."}

Using JWST FRESCO data, we investigate the environments of Lyman-$α$ emitters (LAEs) in the GOODS-N and GOODS-S fields by identifying [OIII] emitters and analyzing their large-scale distribution. Using the FRESCO redshifts, we recover eight new LAEs from archival Keck/MOSFIRE observations at $z=7.0-7.7$, including a potential AGN candidate at $z \\sim 7.2$. Complemented by six literature LAEs, our sample consists of 14 LAEs in total, all of which are [OIII] emitters except for one very faint source not detected by FRESCO. We define seven groups of [OIII] emitters centered around the brightest LAEs and find that these bright LAEs do not reside in more overdense environments than the average galaxy population. The overdensity parameters for LAEs and [OIII] emitters without Lyman-$α$, calculated for sources with $\\mathrm{M_{UV}<-19.5}$ to ensure completeness, are similar, indicating that overdensities alone cannot fully explain Lyman-$α$ visibility. While LAEs have slightly higher recent star formation (SFR$_{10}$/SFR$_{50} \\approx 1.3\\times$) and [OIII] EW ($\\approx1.5\\times$), they show no significant differences from [OIII] emitters in UV slope ($β$), UV magnitude ($\\mathrm{M_{UV}}$), or stellar mass ($\\log_{\\mathrm{M}_{\\star}}$).

We generate populations of synthetic black hole (BH) binaries with masses ranging from the intermediate ($10^3-10^5 M_\\odot$) to the supermassive regime ($>10^5 M_\\odot$), formed from the dynamical processes of merging halos and their residing galaxies, assuming that each galaxy is initially seeded with a single black hole at its centre. The aim is to estimate the rate of these BH mergers which could be detected by LISA and LGWA. Using PINOCCHIO cosmological simulation and a semi-analytical model based on GAEA, we construct a population of merging BHs by implementing a \"light\" seeding scheme and calculating the merging timescales using the Chandrasekhar prescription. We provide upper and lower limits of dynamical friction timescale by varying the mass of the infalling object to create \"pessimistic\" and \"optimistic\" merger rates respectively. We find that for our synthetic population of MBHs, both LGWA and LISA are able to detect more than $15$ binary IMBH mergers per year in the optimistic case, while in the pessimistic case less than $\\sim5$ detections would be possible considering the entire lifetime of the detectors. For SMBHs, the rates are slightly lower in both cases. Most mergers below $z\\approx4$ are detected in the optimistic case, although mergers beyond $z=8$ are also detectable at a lower rate. We find that LGWA is better suited for high-SNR IMBH detections at higher redshift, while LISA is more sensitive to massive SMBHs.

Gas line-of-sight (LoS) velocity maps show a gradient of $60-100$ km s$^{-1}$, generally interpreted as a rotating gas disk consistent with the Tully-Fisher relation. Yet, the stars don't show rotation. Despite a small on-sky extent ($\\sim4$ kpc), the SMC exhibits a large ($\\sim10$ kpc) LoS depth, and the stellar photometric center is offset from the HI kinematic center by $\\sim$1 kpc. With N-body hydrodynamical simulations, we show that a recent ($\\sim$100 Myr ago) SMC-LMC collision (impact parameter $\\sim2$ kpc) explains the observed SMC's internal structure and kinematics. The simulated SMC is initialized with rotating stellar and gaseous disks. Post-collision, the SMC's tidal tail accounts for the large LoS depth. The SMC's stellar kinematics become dispersion dominated ($v/σ\\approx0.2$), with radially outward motions at $R>2$ kpc, and a small ($<10$ km s$^{-1}$) remnant rotation at $R<2$ kpc, consistent with observations. Post-collision gas kinematics are also dominated by radially outward motions, without remnant rotation. Hence, the observed SMC's gas LoS velocity gradient is due to radial motions as opposed to disk rotation. Ram pressure from the LMC's gas disk during the collision imparts $\\approx30$ km s$^{-1}$ kick to the SMC's gas, sufficient to destroy gas rotation and offset the SMC's stellar and gas centers. Our work highlights the critical role of group processing through galaxy collisions in driving dIrr to dE/dSph transformation, including the removal of gas. Consequently, frameworks that treat the SMC as a galaxy in transformation are required to effectively use its observational data to constrain interstellar medium and dark matter physics."}

We aim to investigate scaling relations between observable cluster properties and mass, and to study the radial X-ray profiles of a large sample of optically selected clusters. We analyze a sample of 997 CAMIRA clusters with richness $N > 15$ and redshifts of $0.1 < z < 1.3$. Using bolometric luminosities derived from count rates and a weak-lensing mass calibration, we study the $L-M$ and $N-M$ scaling relations through stacking analysis, while accounting for selection effects and redshift evolution. We also compare clusters with and without X-ray counterparts in the eFEDS catalog in terms of their scaling relations and surface brightness profiles. The best-fit $L-M$ slope ($1.56^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$) is slightly steeper than the self-similar prediction, yet remains consistent with our previous findings. The $N-M$ slope ($0.766^{+0.070}_{-0.060}$) broadly agrees with theoretical expectations and other optical samples. The data do not require any additional redshift evolution beyond the standard self-similar scaling, although current constraints on evolution remain weak. X-ray detected clusters exhibit a steeper $L-M$ slope, higher central surface brightness, and more centrally concentrated X-ray profiles than undetected systems. Our results highlight systematic differences in the X-ray properties between optically and X-ray selected cluster samples. This study extends scaling relation analyses into lower mass and luminosity regimes, demonstrating the value of combining deep X-ray and optical surveys like eROSITA and Subaru HSC."}

The number of known multiplanetary systems is expected to skyrocket with the advent of PLATO and the Roman space telescope. The spin-orbit angle is a key context information for the systems' dynamical history, and in recent years a growing number of planets had their spin-orbit angle measured, revealing a large diversity in orbital configurations, from well-aligned to polar, and even retrograde, orbits. Still, observers lack a robust tool to compare the dynamical state of different systems and to select the most suitable ones for future avenues of exploration, such as investigating the evolutionary pathways and their links to the atmospheric composition. Here, we present ExoNAMD, an open source code aimed at evaluating the dynamical state of multiplanetary systems via the Normalized Angular Momentum Deficit (NAMD) metric. The NAMD measures the deficit in angular momentum with respect to circular, co-planar orbits. It is normalized to compare systems with different architectures and provides a lower limit on the past dynamical excitation of the system. We find that using the spin-orbit angle parameter in the NAMD calculation (A-NAMD) improves the dynamical state's description, compared to using only the relative inclinations (R-NAMD). Comparison of A-NAMD and R-NAMD also yields powerful insights into the interplay between eccentricity and spin-orbit angle. ExoNAMD is a timely tool for easy and fast comparison of the myriad of exoplanetary systems to be discovered by PLATO and Roman, and to optimize the target selection and scientific output for future atmospheric characterization using ELTs, JWST, and Ariel."}

Establishing the correct classification of in-situ and accreted tracers, and distinguishing the various different progenitors that contributed to the accreted population are important tools to deepen our understanding of galactic formation and evolution. Our aim is to refine our knowledge of the assembly history of the Milky Way by studying the dynamics of its globular cluster population and establishing an updated classification among in-situ objects and the different merger events identified. We used a custom built orbit integrator to derive precise orbital parameters, integrals of motions and adiabatic invariants for the globular cluster sample studied. By properly accounting for the rotating bar, which transforms the underlying model in a time-varying potential, we proceeded to a complete dynamical characterisation of the globular clusters. We present a new catalogue of clear associations between globular clusters and structures (both in-situ and accreted) in the Milky Way, and a full table of derived parameters. By using all dynamical information available, we were able to attribute previously unassociated or misclassified globular clusters to the different progenitors, including those responsible for the Aleph, Antaeus, Cetus, Elqui, and Typhon merger events.

Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to discover nearly a million Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa), offering an unprecedented opportunity to constrain dark energy. The vast majority of these events will lack spectroscopic classification and redshifts, necessitating a fully photometric approach to maximize cosmology constraining power. We present detailed simulations based on the Extended LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC), and a cosmological analysis using photometrically classified SNeIa with host galaxy photometric redshifts. This dataset features realistic multi-band light curves, non-SNIa contamination, host mis-associations, and transient-host correlations across the high-redshift Deep Drilling Fields (DDF) (~ 50 deg^2). We also include a spectroscopically confirmed low-redshift sample based on the Wide Fast Deep (WFD) fields. We employ a joint SN+host photometric redshift fit, a neural network based photometric classifier (SCONE), and BEAMS with Bias Corrections (BBC) methodology to construct a bias-corrected Hubble diagram. We produce statistical + systematic covariance matrices, and perform cosmology fitting with a prior using Cosmic Microwave Background constraints. We fit and present results for the wCDM dark energy model, and the more general Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) w0wa model. With a simulated sample of ~6000 events, we achieve a Figure of Merit (FoM) value of about 150, which is significantly larger than the DESVYR FoM of 54. Averaging analysis results over 25 independent samples, we find small but significant biases indicating a need for further analysis testing and development."}

This classification may be biased, as some apparently non-repeating sources could simply have undetected subsequent bursts. To address this, we develop a semi-supervised learning framework to identify distinguishing features of repeaters using primary observational parameters from the Blinkverse database, which draws from the CHIME/FRB Catalogs. The framework combines labeled data (known repeaters and confidently classified non-repeaters) with unlabeled sources previously flagged as non-repeaters but exhibiting repeater-like characteristics. We employ uniform manifold approximation and projection with a nearest-neighbor scheme to select potential candidates, followed by semi-supervised classification using five base estimators, including random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, AdaBoost, and Gradient boost. Each model is fine-tuned through cross-validation, and a voting strategy among the five models is employed to enhance robustness. All models achieve consistently high performance, identifying dispersion measure, peak frequency, and fluence as the most discriminative features. Repeaters tend to show lower dispersion measures, higher peak frequencies, and higher fluences than non-repeaters. We also identify a set of candidate repeaters, several of which are consistent with prior independent studies. Our approach can identify 36 additional repeater candidates that conventional methods may have missed. Finally, the results highlight dispersion measure as a key discriminator between repeaters and non-repeaters, revealing a tension between physical and instrumental origins-either environmental effects, if the two populations arise from distinct progenitors, or detection bias, as nearby sources are more easily observed."}

The observations, centred at 2.1, 5.5, and 9 GHz, cover the central 0.5 deg$^2$ of two Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS) fields down to rms sensitivities of 9-17 $μ$Jy$/$beam at 2.1 GHz, 28-39 $μ$Jy/beam at 5.5 GHz and 38-61 $μ$Jy/beam at 9 GHz. This setup allows us to investigate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of faint radio sources and probe the nature of the sub-mJy population. We extract and validate a robust catalogue of 489 sources at 2.1 GHz, 101 of which are also detected at 5.5 GHz. We perform a multi-frequency analysis of the radio number counts and derive the spectral indices of sources in the deep fields. The spectral index distribution of our sources peaks around $α\\sim -0.7$, consistent with synchrotron emission from the faint radio population. The number counts at 2.1 GHz are consistent with previous deep surveys and theoretical models, and provide a lower limit on the star-forming galaxy population, which is expected to dominate the faint end. The 5.5 GHz data offer new, direct constraints on the sub-mJy radio sky at higher frequencies. By cross-matching with the H-ATLAS catalogue, we identify a sample of sources with far-infrared (FIR) counterparts and explore the far-infrared-radio correlation (FIRRC). The sources with $q_{FIR} \\geq 1.69$ exhibit radio spectral indices typical of star-forming galaxies. Furthermore, we identify a population of radio-only sources with similar indices that may correspond to high-redshift SFGs, lacking counterparts in the FIR survey due to its limited resolution and sensitivity."}

Activity-induced changes in the chromatic apparent stellar radius represent a major challenge for atmospheric characterisation. As surface distributions of magnetic features are generally unknown for stars other than the Sun, we adopt the Sun as a benchmark to study how the chromatic effect depends on the distribution of spots and faculae. Using spot and facular masks derived from SDO/HMI magnetograms and intensitygrams, combined with the SATIRE model, we compute the chromatic dependence of the Sun's apparent radius. We test different methods of convolving surface coverage with spectra the identify physical drivers of the effect. We find that simplified approaches, which neglect the CLV, underestimate the apparent radius, particularly for faculae, whose surface coverage dominates at near-solar activity levels. Proper treatment of facular CLV is therefore essential. The activity-induced variation between solar minimum and maximum reaches around 40 ppm for a Jupiter-like transit, exceeding JWST's expected 10 ppm noise floor, while remaining at around 0.4 ppm for an Earth-like transit."}

Despite these prospects, its faint nature makes a consensus on its origin or population properties difficult to achieve, both in observations and simulations. In the hope of finding a breakthrough, we utilize the ongoing high-resolution cluster simulation, NewCluster. By classifying billions of particles in and around the cluster with a rigorous tracking procedure, we find that the majority of the ICL originates from satellites, including surviving and disrupted galaxies. Another notable finding is that the preprocessed component follows the density profile of dark matter better than the other components and has distinctive properties: old age, low metallicity, and enhanced $α$-element abundance. We further investigate the orbital dynamics, and our results demonstrate that the stripped fraction of satellites is primarily determined by the time since infall and the pericenter distance. By linking the demographic, chemical, and orbital properties of ICL stars to their origins, this work proposes a quantitative approach for tracing the assembly history of galaxy clusters from the ICL."}

The unprecedented combination of extremely precise wavelength calibration, high spectral resolution and high sensitivity of the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) has finally enabled observations that will further constrain both state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of galaxy evolution and theoretical stellar nucleosynthetic yields.

This statistic is analogous to the ''projected fields'' estimator used for the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, $\\langle {\\rm kSZ}^2 \\times {\\rm g} \\rangle$. Our estimator avoids contamination, and is also free from the noise bias that arises when correlating the absolute value of the RMs with galaxies. Moreover, by binning in foreground galaxy redshifts, $\\langle {\\rm RM}^2 \\times {\\rm g} \\rangle$ enables a tomographic reconstruction of the redshift evolution of large-scale cosmic magnetic fields. We model this statistic using the Illustris-TNG cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations and compare with approximate analytic predictions.

It increases towards low redshift, driven by dynamo amplification and magnetized outflows.

In this work, we propose a masked autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on simulated strong-lensing images from the DeepLense ML4SCI benchmark to learn generalizable representations for two downstream tasks: (i) classifying the underlying dark matter model (cold dark matter, axion-like, or no substructure) and (ii) enhancing low-resolution lensed images via super-resolution. We pretrain a Vision Transformer encoder using a masked image modeling objective, then fine-tune the encoder separately for each task. Our results show that MAE pretraining, when combined with appropriate mask ratio tuning, yields a shared encoder that matches or exceeds a ViT trained from scratch. Specifically, at a 90% mask ratio, the fine-tuned classifier achieves macro AUC of 0.968 and accuracy of 88.65%, compared to the scratch baseline (AUC 0.957, accuracy 82.46%). For super-resolution (16x16 to 64x64), the MAE-pretrained model reconstructs images with PSNR ~33 dB and SSIM 0.961, modestly improving over scratch training. We ablate the MAE mask ratio, revealing a consistent trade-off: higher mask ratios improve classification but slightly degrade reconstruction fidelity. Our findings demonstrate that MAE pretraining on physics-rich simulations provides a flexible, reusable encoder for multiple strong-lensing analysis tasks."}

The XODIAC model has been rigorously benchmarked on the well-studied hot Jupiter HD 189733 b, with results compared against these two models. Benchmarking shows excellent agreement and demonstrates that, when the same chemical network and initial conditions are used, the numerical scheme for solving atmospheric chemistry does not significantly affect the results. We also revisited the atmospheric chemistry of HD 189733 b and performed a comparative analysis across the three networks. Sulfur chemistry shows the least variation across networks, carbon chemistry shows slightly more, and phosphorus chemistry varies the most, primarily due to the introduction of unique PHO and PN pathways comprising 390 reactions in the XODIAC-2025 network.

As helium sediments, the gas density in the inner regions of the cluster increases and there is also a non-trivial, radially dependent redistribution of the atomic nuclei and electrons. As a result, the cooling rate in the center increases and this can enhance star formation. On the other hand, there is a slow contraction of the intracluster gas, which may induce gravitational heating and therefore has an opposite effect on star formation. In this work we present these effects and aim to estimate their relevance. For this we have performed a 1-dimensional numerical simulation of helium sedimentation and applied it to a simple semi-analytical model of star formation. We find that for clusters with a halo mass $M_{\\rm halo} \\lesssim 10^{14} M_{\\rm sun}$, helium sedimentation effects on the star formation rate are negligible, even under idealized conditions. In the intermediate range, $10^{14} M_{\\rm sun} \\lesssim M_{\\rm halo} \\lesssim 10^{15} M_{\\rm sun}$, the effects are at most mild, below a factor ~ 2 in the isothermal model we consider, even for idealized conditions.

The supersymmetry-based WZDR framework has demonstrated considerable potential in alleviating the Hubble tension. Previous investigations have examined the interaction between stepped dark radiation and cold dark matter, with the aim of simultaneously addressing both the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions. Given the suppressive effect of scalar field dark matter on small-scale structure growth, we replace cold dark matter with scalar field dark matter in the present work and introduce its interaction with stepped dark radiation via pure momentum coupling, thereby formulating a novel coupling model. We impose constraints on the model parameters using a variety of cosmological datasets, including the Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Type Ia Supernovae, $H_0$ measurements from SH0ES, $S_8$ data from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3, and data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. Our analysis reveals that the performance of the new model is nearly identical to that of the original WZDR model, with only a marginal improvement. When using the full data combination, the best-fit values for $H_0$ in the coupled model and WZDR model are 70.89 km/s/Mpc and 70.68 km/s/Mpc, respectively. For the $S_8$ parameter, the new model results in a decrease from 0.8136 in the original model to 0.8113. Furthermore, the coupling signal remains weak, with the constraint on the coupling parameter being $\\log_{10}(ξ)<4.56$. While the coupling model offers some improvement, it does not fully resolve the cosmological tensions, indicating that further investigation is required to address these issues."}

Accepted by ApJS", "summary": "Recent surveys of the Galactic plane have revealed dozens of giant molecular filaments (GMFs), with lengths ranging from tens to hundreds of parsecs, yet their origins and life cycles remain debated. In this work, we analyze over 700 GMFs identified from synthetic CO emission maps of a high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy, whose lengths range from $\\sim 10$ pc to $\\sim 300$ pc. We find that turbulent shock from galactic shear and stellar feedback are the primary drivers of GMF formation. Magnetized turbulence dominates their internal dynamics, supporting the filaments against global collapse while simultaneously inducing fragmentation into dense clumps. This fragmentation follows the turbulence-driven sausage instability model, rather than pure Jeans instability, and triggers efficient star formation along the filaments. Cloud-cloud collisions are frequent, affecting more than $70\\%$ of GMFs, and often disrupt or reshape their morphology. The typical filamentary lifetime is $t_{\\text{fil}} \\sim 14$ Myr, comparable to the crossing time of giant molecular clouds (GMCs). The molecular gas half-life is $\\sim 7$ Myr, similar to that of GMCs, indicating that GMFs are transient but dynamically important structures."}

Recent studies reopened the possibility of a mass window of PBHs as a compelling candidate for dark matter, particularly in low-mass regimes ($M_{\\text {PBH}}< 10^{15}$ g) where conventional constraints from evaporation are being revisited in light of quantum gravitational effects. One such effect, the \\textit{memory burden effect}, slows down black hole evaporation by incorporating the backreaction of radiation on the black hole microstates, substantially extending the lifetime of light PBHs and thus modifying their late-time emission spectra. This prolonged emission can dramatically alter the energy injection history in the early universe. By computing the modified energy injection rates into the intergalactic medium and incorporating them into the thermal and ionization evolution of neutral hydrogen, we obtain projected constraints on the fraction of dark matter. The bounds are obtained from the fact that these low mass PBHs, which were thought otherwise evaporated, can modify the absorption amplitude in the global 21 cm signal at redshift $z\\approx17$. Considering the two viable scenarios of transition to the memory-burden phase: fast (or instantaneous) and slow (transition with a finite width), we show how the 21 cm bounds are sensitive to different mass ranges. For a broad transition with $δ=10^{-2}$ we find that PBHs in the mass range $M_{\\rm PBH}\\simeq10^{8}$-$10^{13}$ g are excluded at the level of $f_{\\rm PBH}\\gtrsim10^{-8}$. In contrast, for a fast-transition case ($k=1$), the evaporation is suppressed so efficiently that no meaningful 21 cm constraint remains for $M_{\\rm PBH}\\gtrsim10^{7}$ g."}

Using co-spatial UV absorption and optical emission-line spectroscopy, we compare abundances of N, O, S, and Fe in the low-ionization (neutral) and high-ionization (ionized) gas, providing a multi-phase view of enrichment shortly after the current starburst and over longer timescales when ejecta from previous episodes have cooled and mixed. We find that O and S, produced predominantly in short-lived massive stars, are well mixed between the two phases, with scatter reflecting local inhomogeneities. Fe, predominantly produced by Type Ia supernovae on $\\sim$1 Gyr timescales, is higher in the neutral gas, reflecting either delayed mixing of older Fe-enriched material or preferential depletion of Fe from the ionized phase through dust formation in core-collapse supernova ejecta. N exhibits the largest phase offset, with N/H$_{ion}$ systematically $\\sim$0.7 dex higher than N/H$_{neu}$, and the magnitude of this offset correlates with stellar mass, metallicity, star-formation rate, and most strongly with the ISM outflow velocity. N/O ratios in the ionized phase rise rapidly within 3-6 Myr relative to the neutral gas, consistent with N enrichment dominated by Wolf-Rayet stars rather than intermediate-mass AGB stars on longer timescales. These results demonstrate that localized stellar feedback, outflows, and phase-dependent mixing collectively regulate the chemical evolution of star-forming galaxies, providing key insight into the extreme N/O abundances recently observed in galaxies at cosmic dawn."}

Using three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson simulations of multiple soliton mergers, we explore both repulsive and attractive regimes across a wide range of scattering lengths. Our results show that repulsive self-interactions lead to more massive and extended cores with lower central densities compared to the free (non-interacting) fuzzy dark matter case, while attractive interactions enhance central densities and can drive cores toward collapse, once a critical mass is exceeded. We confirm that the mass-radius relation of solitonic cores is well described by analytical predictions, even in the presence of self-interactions, and we extend the core-halo mass relation to scenarios beyond fuzzy dark matter. We find that the scaling relations between core mass, size, and total energy are not universal but depend sensitively on the strength and sign of the self-interaction, as well as on the evolutionary stage of the halo. These results demonstrate that self-interactions provide a natural mechanism to regulate core properties, with important implications for the formation of supermassive black holes and for potential astrophysical signatures in galactic cores."}

A key prediction of this model is that the quasars are seen at smaller angles to the line of sight and so should be more affected by projection, and hence apparently physically smaller, than corresponding radio galaxies, but this has not always been found in earlier studies. We argue that the interpretation of observations requires a less simplistic model for the effects of projection, which takes into account radio sources' finite width and their intrinsic axial ratio distribution. Using this cylindrical configuration as a basis for the simulation of radio galaxies and quasars, we simulate the distribution of the linear size ratio of quasars to radio galaxies for different sample sizes and critical angles. Our simulations that predict the ratio of observed lengths in the presence of a distribution of intrinsic physical sizes and axial ratios that we derive from observation. We conclude that to test the unified scheme, samples should be completely optically identified, sizes should be measurable for all targets, and the sample size should be greater than $\\sim 800$ sources. Such large samples with uniform optical identification and accurate size measurements have not been available in previous work, but should become available from wide-area sky surveys in the near future."}

While CPL serves as a reference parameterization, the Omnipotent and $Λ_{\\rm s}$CDM scenarios were originally proposed as possible solutions to the $H_0$ tension and are selected here because they can yield negative dark energy. These models are examined within a multi-probe framework based on the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect and the lensing-ISW bispectrum. By analyzing both two- and three-point Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) correlations, we assess how their late-time dynamics modify the growth and decay of large-scale gravitational potentials compared to the standard $Λ$CDM cosmology. Despite producing nearly indistinguishable CMB angular spectra at high multipoles, these models yield distinctive signatures in the low-$\\ell$ ISW plateau as well as in higher-order statistics related to ISW, highlighting the power of both large-scale CMB anisotropies and higher-order CMB statistics in testing dark energy physics. Our results demonstrate that combining complementary ISW probes provides an effective way to discriminate between dark energy scenarios and will be crucial to determine whether negative or sign-switching dark energy is ultimately favored or disfavored by forthcoming data."}

We present a comprehensive computational astrochemical model coupling the gas-phase, gas-surface, and surface (cyclotrimerization) reactions, and the physical evolution of the dust grains (coagulation). The model expands upon the basic chemical network from previous models, enhancing them with updated reactions involving hydrocarbons up to pyrene. We applied this model to simulate the chemical evolution of the envelope of the prototypical AGB star IRC+10216, utilizing physical conditions derived from a hydrodynamical model available in literature. To quantify the impact of surface chemistry, we compared scenarios with and without the cyclotrimerization reaction, further testing the sensitivity of our results by varying the key parameter of hydrocarbon desorption energy. We find that surface-catalyzed cyclotrimerization is a viable pathway for aromatic formation in circumstellar environments, capable of enhancing the total abundance of aromatic species by up to an order of magnitude. Crucially, we show that gas-phase chemistry and dust surface processes are intrinsically linked; their synergistic evolution should be modeled self-consistently to accurately predict chemical abundances. This work underscores that constraining uncertain parameters, particularly desorption energies of hydrocarbons, is essential for future realistic modeling of astrochemical processes in evolved stellar systems."}

The code is a development of the AGAMA software package for action-based galaxy modelling and can be downloaded as the AGAMAb code library. Although coded in C++, most of its functions can be accessed from Python. We add to the package functions that facilitate confronting models with data, which involve sky coordinates, lines of sight, distances, extinction, etc. The new torus generator can produce tori for both highly eccentric and nearly circular orbits that lie beyond the range of the earlier torus-mapping code. Tori can be created by interpolation between tori at very low cost. Tori are fundamentally devices for computing ordinary phase-space coordinates from angle-action coordinates, but AGAMAb includes an action finder that returns angle-action coordinates from any given phase-space location. This action finder yields the torus through the given point, so it includes the functionality of an orbit integrator. The action finder is more accurate and reliable but computationally more costly than the widely used Staeckel Fudge. We show how AGAMAb can be used to generate sophisticated but cheap models of tidal streams and use it to analyse data for the GD1 stream. With the most recently published distances to the stream, energy and angular momentum imply that the end that must be leading is trailing, but extremely small changes to the distances rectify the problem."}

There are existing proposals which can effectively eliminate these two contaminants but issues remain for future high-sensitivity and multifrequency CMB polarization observations, such as spatially-varying spectral energy distribution (SED) of polarized foreground and cosmological $B$-mode signals due to primordial magnetic fields (PMFs). In this work, we investigate inference of PGW $B$-mode signals in the presence of both complexities. We employ a constrained moment internal linear combination (cMILC) method to remove polarization signals arising from spatially varying SEDs. Also, we employ a power-spectrum-based approach to extracting both the Galactic and cosmological $B$-mode components. Two methods have been validated by mock data and different consistency tests have been performed. We apply these two methods to end-to-end simulations for future high-sensitivity and multifrequency polarization observations and investigate the detectability of different $B$-mode signals in the presence of non-Gaussian polarized foregrounds under different scenarios.

The central velocities, if attributed entirely to isotropic turbulence, correspond to a transonic ICM at sub-6 kpc scales with three-dimensional Mach number 0.69 (+0.14 / -0.11) and a non-thermal pressure fraction of 21 (+7 / -5)%. Simple models of weak shocks and sound waves and calculations assuming isotropic turbulence both support the hypothesis that the velocity field reflects a mix of shock-driven expansion and turbulence. Compared to other clusters observed by XRISM to date, M87's central region stands out as the most kinematically disturbed, exhibiting both the highest velocity dispersion and the largest 3D Mach number, concentrated at the smallest physical scales."}

Utilizing the latest data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, BAO), Pantheon+ (Type Ia Supernovae, SNIa), and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data (including lensing) from \\textit{Planck} and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), we report three key findings. First, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred from the combined data consistently aligns with early-universe measurements across all models, indicating a persistent Hubble tension. Second, we find compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy: early-universe (CMB) constraints favor a phantom phase (with an equation-of-state parameter $w < -1$), while late-universe (BAO/SNIa) data prefer quintessence ($w > -1$). Third, the full dataset suggests a late-time interaction between dark energy and matter. Our results demonstrate that dark energy evolves with cosmic time, challenging the cosmological constant paradigm."}

In this work, we investigate whether incorporating high-redshift environmental factors improves the accuracy of matching high-redshift galaxies to their $z\\sim0$ descendants, using data from the EAGLE and MAGNETICUM simulations. Using random forest regression, we evaluate the relative importance of a set of environmental metrics at $z\\sim3$ in determining the stellar mass of descendant galaxies at $z\\sim0$. We identify the spherical overdensity within 1 cMpc ($δ_{1,\\mathrm{sp}}$) as the most important environmental predictor. Tracking galaxies at $z\\sim3$ with similar initial stellar masses but different $δ_{1,\\mathrm{sp}}$ values, we find that, across all mass bins in both simulations, high-density environments produce $z\\sim0$ descendants with median stellar masses up to eight times higher than the descendants of galaxies in low-density environments. For galaxies with $M_{*}\\lesssim10^{10}M_{\\odot}$, the difference is attributable to more merger-induced mass growth in high-density environments, whereas for higher-mass galaxies, it results from a combination of enhanced in-situ star formation and greater external mass accretion. By assessing the importance of overdensity across multiple scales and redshifts, we find that at $z\\gtrsim2$, environmental factors become as important as stellar mass in predicting the stellar mass of $z\\sim0$ descendants. Compared to using stellar mass at $z\\sim3$ alone, incorporating $δ_{1,\\mathrm{sp}}$ reduces the scatter in the residuals between the predicted and actual stellar masses by approximately 20% in EAGLE and 35% in MAGNETICUM."}

Deviating slightly from the latter by introducing a homogeneous and isotropic initial velocity dispersion, we show that all higher momentum cumulants are generated dynamically at any perturbative order. We support our numerical solutions by an analytical large-scale approximation.

We identify 22 DSFGs detected by both ALMA and JWST, 10 of which are spectroscopically confirmed as protocluster members. This is the first systematic analysis of a statistical DSFG sample in $z\\sim2$ protocluster environments using JWST/NIRCam data. Most of the DSFG members exhibit very red colors and reside in the dusty star-forming region of the rest-frame UVJ diagram, indicating strong dust obscuration. The Gini-M20 diagram suggests that most DSFGs in this protocluster are late-type disks, with a significant fraction displaying clumpy and disturbed rest-frame UV/optical morphologies, but few showing clear merger signatures. The DSFG members exhibit relatively large stellar disks and effective radii with a median stellar mass of log(M/Msun) = 10.8 +/- 0.3, placing them above coeval field DSFGs and typical protocluster galaxies in the size-mass relation at both rest-frame optical and near-infrared wavelengths. These sizes are comparable to those of more evolved field DSFGs at z~1-2, indicating accelerated structural growth in dense environments. Moreover, these DSFG members show a decreasing trend in stellar size from shorter to longer wavelengths, with a moderately steep slope comparable to coeval field DSFGs. These results may support an inside-out growth scenario for protocluster evolution, in which massive galaxies near the center are more evolved and more strongly affected by AGN feedback and environmental effects, e.g., ram-pressure stripping. We propose that the cold gas accretion at the protocluster outskirts drives intense star formation and stellar disk growth in ALMA-detected DSFGs, which are expected to evolve into massive elliptical galaxies at later stages."}

In this study, we use the high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulation NewHorizon, which self-consistently evolves BH mass and spin, to statistically examine the relationship between AGN jet orientation and host galaxy structure. Building upon our previous work, we extend the analysis of projected (2-d) alignment angles to facilitate more direct comparisons with recent observational studies. In our methodology, galaxy orientations are estimated using optical position angles derived from synthetic DESI-LS and Euclid images, while BH spin vectors serve as proxies for AGN jet directions. From a carefully selected sample of 100 BH-galaxy systems at low redshift, we generate a catalog of 5,000 mock optical images using a Monte Carlo approach that samples random viewing angles and redshifts. Our results reveal a statistically significant tendency for AGN jets to align with the orientation of their host galaxies, consistent with recent observations combining Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and optical imaging of nearby AGNs. Furthermore, we find a slightly stronger alignment when using kinematic position angles derived from synthetic MaNGA-like stellar velocity fields. These findings underscore the importance of combining morphological, kinematic, and polarimetric information to disentangle the complex interplay between black hole spin evolution, accretion mode, and the galactic environment in shaping the direction of relativistic jets."}

Using this sample we reproduce, as the second objective of the paper, the Twins Embedding (TE) spectrophotometric standardisation method, which led to an exceptionally low value of 0.073 mag for the intrinsic scatter. We improve the flux-calibration accuracy of the SEDm SN Ia spectral sample using the ZTF photometric data, which are calibrated at the percent level. We then apply the three steps of the TE parameterisation to a subset of 783 ZTF SN spectra near maximum light, and analyse the resulting standardisation methods. The precision of the phase correction model, which is the first step of the TE, is estimated at 0.01 mag in g band, using ZTF data. Despite the challenge posed by the ZTF spectrum extraction pipeline, we apply a first standardisation in color based on the second step of the TE, the Read Between The Lines (RBTL). When considering the scatter due to the redshift error and the flux calibration error, we estimate a 0.129 mag Hubble residual scatter for this ZTF sample as an upper limit. As expected from the low spectral quality, the final TE standardisation based on three non-linear parameters did not improve the overall dispersion. We release 1897 flux calibrated spectra of 1607 SNe Ia with an estimated photometric accuracy of 0.07 mag. We further demonstrate the ability to apply a spectrophotometric standardisation with limited quality spectra. The RBTL standardisation is more efficient than that of SALT with one less parameter, and the resulting host steps are consistent with zero, making it less prone to astrophysical bias. For future spectroscopic surveys, a better spectral quality would enable the full TE standardisation to be computed. (Abridged)"}

Stellar feedback is the property that most significantly correlates with the HI morphological deviation from observations, although these deviations mostly occur at a high stellar or black-hole mass.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detection of COMs toward a site of SNR-cloud interaction. The derived D/H ratios (0.01-0.04) and COM abundances are consistent with those reported toward typical low-mass starless cores and comparable to cometary values. The overall level of chemical complexity is relatively low, in line with an early evolutionary stage. We suggest that the Clump is a early stage shock-induced low-mass star forming region, not yet protostellar. We speculate that SNR shocks may set the physical and chemical conditions to form stars. The resulting chemical budget may be preserved along the formation process of a planetary system, being finally incorporated into planetesimals and cometesimals."}

Quasar absorption lines - the imprints left by intervening gas on the light from distant quasars - provide key diagnostics of many aspects of this investigation, ranging from fundamental physics to cosmology and galaxy formation. The unprecedented combination of extremely precise wavelength calibration, high spectral resolution and high sensitivity of the Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanet and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO) has finally enabled observations that will further constrain both state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of galaxy evolution and theoretical stellar nucleosynthetic yields. In this article, we present the ESPRESSO Quasar Absorption Line Survey (EQUALS), an ESO Large Programme, designed to tackle several outstanding questions from constraining the properties of dark matter at the smallest scales probed by the Lyman-alpha forest to determining the temperature of the intergalactic medium at z ~ 4 and precisely quantifying the chemical contributions of stellar populations in the early Universe. EQUALS will provide a legacy sample of deep spectra to showcase ESPRESSO capabilities to the quasar absorption line community whilst providing epoch measurements for the key science goals of upcoming spectroscopic instrumentation on the next generations of telescopes."}

We also investigate the scenario of the apparent phantom crossing, where dark matter energy density decreases more slowly than usually expected, which might explain the DESI observations. In the scenarios developed, the energy conditions are not violated by any component of the cosmic fluid. In the framework of the apparent phantom crossing, we also propose a new scenario, where the particle corresponding to the scalar field in the scalar--Einstein--Gauss-Bonnet gravity is dark matter. The mass of the particle might increase due to the coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, which makes the decrease of the dark matter energy density slower. This last scenario may suggest that the inverse phantom crossing might be related to the transition from the decelerating expansion of the Universe to the accelerating expansion."}

Results: The near-IR continuum reveals two infrared sources, IRS 2 and IRS 7, while the main protostellar core IRAS 18162-2048 remains undetected up to $2.47 \\mathrm{μm}$. IRS 7 shows a peculiar Hydrogen Recombination Line Br$γ$ profile with a narrow emission component superimposed on a broad absorption feature, consistent with a B2/B3 zero-age main-sequence star. Extended H$_2$ emission exhibits a `sawtooth' pattern in the excitation diagram, characteristic of UV radiation in a PDR rather than shock excitation.

VLA X and C bands observations reveal a compact radio source previously reported as a stationary condensation (SC) and coincident with IRS 7. For the first time, we detect IRS 7/SC in mm wavelengths. The spectral index in the 3$-$6 cm and 3.3 mm regime is consistent with optically thin free-free emission. Conclusions: Our near-IR and radio observations reveal that IRS 7/SC is a B2/B3 ZAMS star that has begun to photoionise its environment, giving rise to an extended PDR and a compact \\ion{H}{ii} region. The coexistence of this source with the deeply embedded protostar IRAS 18162-2048 and other bubble-like structures in the field, suggests a multigenerational star-forming environment.

Interestingly, inward- and outward-moving satellites/subhalos show contrasting orbital alignment behaviors, which can be understood in terms of their radial alignment, orbit decay due to dynamical friction and the effect of tidal stripping. The orbital alignment is stronger in more massive halos. In the end, we explore the orbital alignment measured by a mock observer, and find that the alignment reported by Pace et al.

In this work, we propose a masked autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on simulated strong-lensing images from the DeepLense ML4SCI benchmark to learn generalizable representations for two downstream tasks: (i) classifying the underlying dark matter model (cold dark matter, axion-like, or no substructure) and (ii) enhancing low-resolution lensed images via super-resolution. We pretrain a Vision Transformer encoder using a masked image modeling objective, then fine-tune the encoder separately for each task. Our results show that MAE pretraining, when combined with appropriate mask ratio tuning, yields a shared encoder that matches or exceeds a ViT trained from scratch. Specifically, at a 90% mask ratio, the fine-tuned classifier achieves macro AUC of 0.968 and accuracy of 88.65%, compared to the scratch baseline (AUC 0.957, accuracy 82.46%). For super-resolution (16x16 to 64x64), the MAE-pretrained model reconstructs images with PSNR ~33 dB and SSIM 0.961, modestly improving over scratch training. We ablate the MAE mask ratio, revealing a consistent trade-off: higher mask ratios improve classification but slightly degrade reconstruction fidelity. Our findings demonstrate that MAE pretraining on physics-rich simulations provides a flexible, reusable encoder for multiple strong-lensing analysis tasks."}

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "This work investigates the presence and evolution of the MZhR from redshift z=3.5 to z=0, and identifies when galaxies settle on the present-day MZhR. We used central galaxies with log10(Mgal/Msun)=[9,11] from CIELO simulations. We identified stellar halos, from z=3.5 to z=0, using the AM-E method, focusing on the region between the 1.5 optical radius and the virial radius. We presented halo cardiograms, a novel approach to studying the assembly history of stellar halos. Using them, we defined a stability time (tst) as the first time that the median halo metallicity does not change more than \\pm 0.1 dex with respect to its value at z=0. CIELO stellar halos reproduce the present-day observed MZhR. At z=3.5, stellar halos already define an MZhR whose slope is similar to the slope at z=0. For a fixed stellar halo mass, the metallicity increases ~0.21 dex from z=3.5 to z=0, reflecting the progressive chemical enrichment provided by the accretion of satellites with diverse masses and different levels of enrichment. When the first stellar halo main contributor (SHMC1) provides a mass fraction at least 20% higher than the remaining contributors, the stellar halo metallicity is set once SHMC1 is fully disrupted (tmerger). This yields a clear correlation between tst and tmerger, with a scatter of 2.2 Gyr driven by the relative importance of the second and third main contributing satellites. We provide two observational tracers for tst: t90 and a stability time from the age-metallicity relation. Our results suggest that estimating tst could serve as a proxy for dating the moment at which the stellar halo reaches the present-day MZhR, as well as for dating the last major merger that builds them. Combined with an estimation of the merger time of the main contributing satellite, it can provide insights into the relative importance of the second and third contributing satellites. (abridged)"}

In the present study, we consider the case of dark matter described by a massive vector field, also referred to as the Proca field. The density profile in the vicinity of the black hole is explicitly constructed for a broad range of dark matter mass, $μ\\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-15}{\\mathrm eV}$, which allows it to exhibit both particle and wave-like characteristics. While in the particle regime, the computation of the DM density distribution is analytically tractable, we find it convenient to compute the same numerically in the wave regime. Nevertheless, in the outer region, the surrounding dark matter is assumed to follow a broken power-law distribution, represented by a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with a central spike. For the purpose of investigating the detectability of the vector dark matter in the gravitational wave spectrum, we have modelled a stellar-mass black hole ($1M_{\\odot}$) inspiralling into a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $10^4M_{\\odot}$ within such a vector dark matter environment. With this setup, we analyzed the dephasing in the gravitational wave strain induced by vector dark matter and performed a Fisher forecast for upcoming LISA observations, with particular emphasis on the distinctive features in both the particle and wave regimes of the dark matter.

Both systems show kiloparsec-scale soft X-ray emission. In FIRST J120041, the X-ray morphology is clumpy and closely follows the [O III] structures, with surface-brightness peaks co-spatial with the highest [O III] velocities (600-750 km s$^{-1}$) and broadest line widths (FWHM~1700 km s$^{-1}$). In 2MASX J130038, the X-rays are more centrally concentrated and only weakly correlated with the largely rotational [O III] kinematics.

Combining these results with a broader sample of twelve type 2 quasars, we argue that luminous quasars evolve along a continuous feedback sequence regulated by the progressive clearing of circumnuclear gas. As AGN radiation and winds pierce through the surrounding medium, systems transition from heavily enshrouded, compact configurations to phases where the X-ray and [O III] components strongly couple and, eventually, to large-scale, energetically dominant outflows. FIRST J120041 and 2MASX J130038 represent two points along this sequence, tracing the emergence and growth of hot winds as primary drivers of quasar-scale feedback."}

It is not statistically consistent with several upper bound derived by two greater and longer life detectors: by IceCube and in particular by AUGER array. Asymmetry in recent IceCube neutrino alert tracks upward and downward at same horizontal angles as ARCA one, suggest that they are mostly polluted atmospheric muon bundles. This paucity also disfavor the skimming neutrino interpretation by ARCA. We suggest that the array floating and bending in the deep sea may lead, sometime, to a misleading geometry that is pointing to a wrong arrival angle direction: a much less horizontal muon (neutrino) track respect to a much real one, more inclined and vertical, due to atmospheric muon bundle or charmed single event.

By employing the methods of Thermofield Dynamics (TFD), a real time formalism of thermal quantum field theory, we derive the modified occupation numbers of the Hawking spectrum for asymptotically flat spacetimes like the Schwarzschild and the Kerr geometries. These corrections depend on the interplay between the BH temperature and the ambient bath temperature. We apply this formalism in the early universe reheating background scenario arising after inflation and demonstrate that the thermal correction to Hawking spectrum enhances the evaporation rate of primordial black holes (PBHs).

By combining phenomenological and photoionization modeling of the absorption features, we characterize empirical correlations among UFO properties. We find that line width, equivalent width, and outflow velocity are positively correlated, indicating that the broadest and strongest absorption lines trace the fastest winds, although the $\\upsilon_\\mathrm{out} - σ$ trend is comparatively weak. The large inferred velocity dispersions, often exceeding the uncertainty on the centroid velocity, must be included when estimating wind energetics and scaling relations. From the velocity constraints we derive lower limits on the launching radii, finding a minimum distance consistent with the innermost stable circular orbit of a weakly or non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole. We also assess for the first time how UFO properties depend on AGN class: differences between Seyferts and quasars, bridged by narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, appear to be driven mainly by black hole mass and luminosity. The observed co-variation of velocity, width, and equivalent width supports a picture of clumpy, multi-component winds propagating through a thermally unstable multiphase medium within the chaotic cold accretion (CCA) cycle, and is consistent with both magnetically and line-driven acceleration.

We derive relativistic accretion rate and compute spin-dependent efficiency $λ_{\\text{Kerr}}(a_*)$. Using this result, we construct coupled evolution equations for the PBH mass and spin that include both relativistic accretion and spin-dependent evaporation.

We generate populations of synthetic black hole (BH) binaries with masses ranging from the intermediate ($10^3-10^5 M_\\odot$) to the supermassive regime ($>10^5 M_\\odot$), formed from the dynamical processes of merging halos and their residing galaxies, assuming that each galaxy is initially seeded with a single black hole at its centre. The aim is to estimate the rate of these BH mergers which could be detected by LISA and LGWA. Using PINOCCHIO cosmological simulation and a semi-analytical model based on GAEA, we construct a population of merging BHs by implementing a \"light\" seeding scheme and calculating the merging timescales using the Chandrasekhar prescription. We provide upper and lower limits of dynamical friction timescale by varying the mass of the infalling object to create \"pessimistic\" and \"optimistic\" merger rates respectively. We find that for our synthetic population of MBHs, both LGWA and LISA are able to detect more than $15$ binary IMBH mergers per year in the optimistic case, while in the pessimistic case less than $\\sim5$ detections would be possible considering the entire lifetime of the detectors. For SMBHs, the rates are slightly lower in both cases. Most mergers below $z\\approx4$ are detected in the optimistic case, although mergers beyond $z=8$ are also detectable at a lower rate. We find that LGWA is better suited for high-SNR IMBH detections at higher redshift, while LISA is more sensitive to massive SMBHs. Joint observations will probe the full BH mass spectrum and constrain BH formation and seeding models."}

We identify 14 AGN exhibiting rapid (on timescales of tens of kiloseconds) X-ray flux variations by factors of two or more that are statistically significant ($p\\le6\\times10^{-4}$), indicative of fast coronal variability. By converting minimum variability timescales to light-crossing times, we place upper limits on the sizes of the variable coronal regions, finding typical scales of $\\lesssim10^{-4}$~pc. The coronal variable region size upper limits of an AGN in our sample are found to be much smaller than the typical coronal sizes inferred from microlensing, suggesting that its corona is composed of localized, transient structures rather than smooth, homogeneous plasmas. Such efficient magnetic energy dissipation in compact volumes is consistent with expectations for magnetically dominated coronae and is supported by recent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Future high-throughput X-ray observatories will enable the detection of even faster coronal variability, providing direct constraints on the physical mechanisms driving plasma energization and flux fluctuation near supermassive black holes. Our results suggest that luminous AGN hosting massive black holes are prime targets for probing the small-scale structure and dynamics of AGN coronae."}

Typically, this is done by measuring the fraction of young stars with infrared-excess, a sign of circumstellar material, in stellar clusters of different ages. However, comparing data from different star-forming regions at different distances introduces uncertainties and biases because of the different sample completeness and environment. This study addresses these challenges by analyzing 33 clusters, aged 3 to 21 million years (PARSEC isochrones), within the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association, sampling the stellar IMF from the hydrogen burning limit to about 8 M$_\\odot$. By using $\\mathit{Gaia}$, 2MASS, and WISE data, we identified stars with infrared-excess through color-color diagrams and spectral energy distributions, ensuring a consistent selection of disk-bearing sources. Our results indicate a disk lifetime of $5.8 \\pm 0.3$ Myr, about a factor of two longer than most previous estimates, suggesting that planet formation may have more time than previously thought. We also find that an exponential decay model best describes disk dispersal. These findings emphasize the importance of studying disk evolution in a single star-forming region to reduce uncertainties and refine our understanding of planet formation timelines."}

Surprisingly, disconnected gamma-ray tails have recently been discovered by H.E.S.S., HAWC and LHAASO, hundreds of light-years away and with energies of tens of TeV. We suggest that tens PeV neutron burst jets were ejected from the SS433 system over the past century. These beams of ultra high-energy PeVatron neutrons, by their in-flight beta decay and Inverse Compton scattering, could be the source of the enigmatic, distant and disconnected tens of TeV gamma-ray beams. These ultra-relativistic PeV neutron jets could have been formed during one of the system's rare and intense tidal eruptions, when tens of PeV protons collide CV October 2025 with thermal ultraviolet photons, creating delta resonances. Their decay into secondary neutron beams of tens of PeV is well consistent with observations. Alternative models appear uncompetitive."}

The precisely determined ages of young open clusters make their planets particularly valuable for tracing the early evolution of planetary systems. As the second paper of the UPiC project, this study focuses on stars in stellar groups that host transiting planets or planetary candidates. We categorize these stellar groups into Open Clusters (OCs) and Moving Groups (MGs) based on the Jacobi radius to investigate potential differences in their planetary systems. By cross-matching the latest star cluster catalogs with catalogs of transiting planets and candidates, we have compiled the most extensive catalog to date, containing 106 confirmed planets and 168 candidates within OCs and MGs. We refitted the structural parameters of these stellar groups and identified substructures using the \\texttt{HDBSCAN} and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithms. Our analysis reveals the density evolution of both MGs and OCs during their first Gyr. We find that MGs consistently exhibit a significantly higher planet fraction than OCs, regardless of sample selection, particularly for Hot Jupiters. Furthermore, exoplanet radii show a clear dichotomy at early stages: most sub-Jupiters evolve into Neptune-sized planets within 100 Myr, while super-Jupiters undergo only minimal contraction. These results suggest that young sub-Jupiters (\\textless 100 Myr) represent puffy, Neptune-mass planets undergoing vigorous photoevaporation, whereas Jupiter-mass planets can maintain their atmospheres. We also report evidence for the early emergence of the hot-Neptune desert at 100 Myr in both OCs and MGs."}

At small Stokes numbers, shock trapping leads to extreme density inhomogeneities and nearly singular aggregation, with correlation dimensions approaching zero. With increasing inertia, particles undergo inertial escape and intermittently cross shock fronts, producing a sharp crossover from shock-dominated trapping to quasi-ballistic dynamics. This crossover is accompanied by a pronounced reduction in density fluctuations, a continuous increase of the correlation dimension from zero to the embedding dimension, and a power-law dependence of density fluctuations on the Stokes number over an extended intermediate regime. In this regime, particle distributions show scale-free coarse-grained density statistics arising from repeated trap--escape dynamics. This behaviour is qualitatively distinct from inertial-particle clustering in incompressible turbulence and is directly relevant to dust concentration in shock-rich regions of protoplanetary discs and other compressible astrophysical environments."}

We show how the escaping CRs accelerate and heat the ISM fluid depending on the CR diffusion coefficient. The CR heating effects are potentially responsible for the recent observations of the unexpected H$α$ and [OIII]$λ$5007 lines in old supernova remnants. The implied gas outflow by CRs can be comparable to the Galactic star formation rate, compatible with the Galactic wind required for the metal-polluted halo gas and the production of eROSITA bubbles. Assuming a locally suppressed CR diffusion and a few nearby CR sources in the Local Bubble, we also propose alternative interpretations for the Galactic CR proton spectrum around the Earth measured with CALET, AMS02, and Voyager I."}

The observed cometary behavior of 3I, including its preponderance of CO$_2$ emission, lack of CO output, small size, and predominance of large icy chunks of material in a flux-dominant coma is reminiscent of the behavior of short period comet 103P/Hartley 2, target of the NASA Deep Impact extended mission in 2010 and a ``hyperactive comet'' near the end of its outgassing lifetime. This correspondence places 3I closer to barely- or non-active 1I/Oumuamua than primitive, ice rich 2I/Borisov, suggesting that ISOs are often highly thermally processed before ejection into the ISM."}

The winds of those stars collide and are accreted, at a rate that depends on their chemical composition. Here we aim to revisit the evolutionary status of the evolved massive stars at the GC, by means of new tracks based on updated mass-loss rate recipes for the earlier stages of massive stars.\n  We use the Geneva-evolution-code for initial stellar masses ranging from 20 to 60 $M_\\odot$, for metallicity $Z=0.020$. We adopt a new mass-loss rate recipe for the line-driven winds of O-type stars and B-supergiants, plus a new recipe for the dust-driven winds of red supergiants (RSG). Additionally, we set up initial rotation $Ω/Ω_\\text{crit}=0.4$, and we adopt the Ledoux criterion for the treatment of convection in inner layers.\n  We found that evolution models adopting new mass-loss rate prescriptions predict that stars will lose less of their outer layers during their initial phases, while a big reduction of mass happens at the RSG phase. As a consequence, the resulting Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are less radially homogeneous in their inner structure from the core to the surface. Also, these new evolution models predict the absence of hydrogen-free WN stars. These evolutionary predictions agree better with the observed chemical abundances of the WR stars at the GC.\n  We provide a table with the chemical H, He, and CNO abundances calculated for the different subtypes of WR stars. We propose a different re-arrangement of the WR subtypes to be used for the modelling of the collision of their winds. We discuss the potential implications of these changes for the colliding winds generated from the massive stars at the GC, which are accreting onto the supermassive black hole Sgr A*."}
