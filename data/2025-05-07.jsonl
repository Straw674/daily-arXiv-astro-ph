Here, we employ\nsupercomoving coordinates to study the magnetic field amplification from\ndecaying turbulence during gravitational collapse. We perform three-dimensional\nsimulations and show that for large magnetic Reynolds numbers, there can be\nexponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time before\nthe decay of turbulence impedes further amplification. The collapse dynamics\nonly affects the nonlinear feedback from the Lorentz force, which diminishes\nmore rapidly for shorter collapse times, allowing nearly kinematic continued\ngrowth. We also confirm that helical turbulence is more efficient in driving\ndynamo action than nonhelical turbulence, but this difference decreases for\nlarger collapse times. We also show that for nearly irrotational flows, dynamo\namplification is still possible, but it is always associated with a growth of\nvorticity -- even if it still remains very small. In nonmagnetic runs, the\ngrowth of vorticity is associated with viscosity and grows with the Mach\nnumber. In the presence of magnetic fields, vorticity emerges from the curl of\nthe Lorentz force."}

By analyzing the spatial distribution of field stars younger than 100\nMyr, we identify large-scale stellar complexes and substructures using HDBSCAN\n-- a density-based clustering algorithm -- and trace their evolution over time.\nWhile comparing these stellar structures in different regions of the galaxy, we\nfind that the central bar-like region shows a clear expansion of the structures\nwithin the first $\\sim$ 60 Myrs, while the arm-like structure in the NE shows\nno discernible trend, possibly due to external perturbations from tidal\ninteractions with a neighboring galaxy. An age-dependent two point correlation\nfunction (TPCF) analysis shows that young stars exhibit a strong hierarchical\ndistribution, with clustering strength decreasing over time. The power-law\nslope of the TPCF, which starts at $\\alpha \\sim 0.65$ for stars younger than 5\nMyr, shows a slight decline to $\\alpha \\sim 0.4$ for stars older than 50 Myr,\nthough it does not reach a completely flat (random) distribution.

These MBHBs may be surrounded by circumbinary disks\nand minidisks, the electromagnetic emission from which are essential for\nlocalizing the MBHBs on the sky. Here we present the first radiative\nmagnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) minidisk simulation that directly solves the\nradiative transfer equation on discretized grid rays. The simulation examines\none of the minidisks in an equal-mass $2\\times10^7\\,M_\\odot$ MBHB separated by\n100 gravitational radii. Minidisks simulated with and without radiative effects\nresemble each other qualitatively but differ in several key aspects. The RMHD\nminidisk is denser and geometrically thinner than the magnetohydrodynamics\nminidisk. Furthermore, the RMHD minidisk, with a nonaxisymmetric photosphere\nand temperature distribution, produces an anisotropic illumination pattern. As\na result, the observed radiative flux of two RMHD minidisks orbiting each other\nvaries at half the binary orbital period, a feature independent of relativistic\nboosting and lensing effects. Such periodic light curves, if identified in\nupcoming optical transient surveys, could reveal the existence of MBHBs on the\nway to merger, particularly if they are in a constant phase relation with\ndetected GWs."}

Authors' version", "summary": "We study the spectroscopic appearance of very massive stars and their effect\non the integrated light of starbursts at low metallicity (Z). We adopt two\nframeworks for the mass loss rates of VMS: in one case we assume no Z\ndependence, in the other case we assume a linear scaling with Z. We compute\nevolutionary models for masses 150, 200, 250 and 300 Msun at Z=0.2, 0.1 and\n0.01 Zsun. We compute the associated synthetic spectra at selected points along\nthe evolutionary tracks. Finally we build population synthesis models including\nVMS. We find that the evolution of VMS critically depends on the assumptions\nregarding mass loss rates. In case of no Z dependence VMS remain hot for all\ntheir lifetime. Conversely when mass loss rates are reduced because of lower Z\nVMS follow a classical evolution towards the red part of the HR diagram. VMS\ndisplay HeII 1640 emission in most phases of their evolution, except when they\nbecome too cool. This line is present in the integrated light of population\nsynthesis models down to 0.1 Zsun whatever the star formation history, and is\nalso sometimes seen at Z=0.01 Zsun. HeII 1640 is weaker in models that include\na Z scaling of the mass loss rates. The optical spectra of starbursts,\nespecially the Wolf-Rayet bumps, sometimes display VMS signatures when these\nstars are present. At low Z, adding VMS to population synthesis models produces\nmore ionising photons down to 45 eV. At higher energy the ionising flux depends\non age, Z, assumption regarding VMS mass loss rates, and on the very short\nphases at the end of VMS evolution. HeII ionising fluxes large enough to\nproduce some amount of nebular HeII 4686 emission can be produced under\nspecific circumstances. Our models are able to reproduce qualitatively and\nsometimes also quantitatively the UV spectra of star-forming regions. However\nwe are not able to clearly identify which mass loss framework is favoured."}

Dispersion measures (DM) serve as a distinctive\nobservable of fast radio bursts (FRBs). They quantify the electron column\ndensity along each line of sight and reveal the missing baryons that are\ndescribed in the Macquart (DM-z) relation. The scatter of this relation is\nanticipated to be caused by the variation in the cosmic structure. This is not\nyet statistically confirmed, however. We present statistical evidence that the\ncosmological baryons fluctuate. Methods: We measured the foreground galaxy\nnumber densities around 14 and 13 localized FRBs with the WISE-PS1-STRM and\nWISE x SCOS photometric redshift galaxy catalog, respectively. The foreground\ngalaxy number densities were determined through a comparison with measured\nrandom apertures with a radius of 1 Mpc. Results: We found a positive\ncorrelation between the excess of DM that is contributed by the medium outside\ngalaxies (DM_cosmic) and the foreground galaxy number density. The correlation\nis strong and statistically significant, with median Pearson coefficients of\n0.6 and 0.6 and median p-values of 0.012 and 0.032 for the galaxy catalogs,\nrespectively, as calculated with Monte Carlo simulations. Conclusions: Our\nfindings indicate that the baryonic matter density outside galaxies exceeds its\ncosmic average along the line of sight to regions with an excess galaxy\ndensity, but there are fewer baryons along the line of sight to low-density\nregions. This is statistical evidence that the ionized baryons fluctuate\ncosmologically on a characteristic scale of $\\lesssim$6 Mpc."}
