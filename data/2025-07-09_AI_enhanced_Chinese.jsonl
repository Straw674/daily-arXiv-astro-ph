The highly magnified object Earendel within the Sunrise was previously\nidentified as a candidate star or binary due to size constraints placed by the\nlensing magnification, however recent works have suggested this constraint may\nbe relaxed to even the size of star clusters. Here, we explore the hypothesis\nthat Earendel may actually be a star cluster, and simultaneously evaluate other\nstar clusters within the host galaxy. Leveraging deep, archival James Webb\nSpace Telescope NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy, we determine a spectroscopic\nredshift for the Sunrise galaxy $z=5.926 \\pm 0.013$, and we fit simple stellar\npopulation (SSP) models from three premier libraries to evaluate the physical\nparameters of Earendel and another distinct star cluster in the Sunrise dubbed\n`$1b$'. We find the rest-UV through optical continuum of Earendel to be\nwell-described by an SSP, nearly equivalently to $1b$ which is confidently a\nstar cluster. We infer they have intermediate ages $t_{\\rm age}\\sim\n30$--$150\\,$Myr, are metal poor ($Z_\\star\\lesssim10\\%\\,Z_\\odot$), and are\nconsistent with the formation age-metallicity trend seen in local globular\nclusters.

We show that SMDS-seeded SMBHs,\nwith comoving seed number density of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-3}$\ncan be the dominant contributor to the PTA signal, with mass $> 10^9 M_\\odot$\nbinaries acquiring a peak merger rate at $z< 1$. By contrast, SMBHs seeded via\nthe DCBH channel may contribute only sub-dominantly unless produced with a much\nlarger number density than implied by numerical simulations.
