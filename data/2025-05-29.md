### [1] [GalSBI-SPS: a stellar population synthesis-based galaxy population model for cosmology and galaxy evolution applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21610)
*Luca Tortorelli,Silvan Fischbacher,Daniel Grün,Alexandre Refregier,Sabine Bellstedt,Aaron S. G. Robotham,Tomasz Kacprzak*

**TL;DR**: GalSBI-SPS是一种新的基于SPS的星系种群模型，通过前向建模生成真实的星系目录，用于模拟HSC数据，并验证其在红移分布、光度特性和物理特性方面的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 下一代光度学和光谱学调查将能够对宇宙学模型和星系形成与演化进行前所未有的测试，但需要精确理解星系的选择效应和测量偏差，特别是红移分布n(z)的准确估计。

Data: 使用了HSC在COSMOS场的数据，以及通过GalSBI-SPS模型生成的模拟数据。

Method: GalSBI-SPS模型通过采样星系物理特性，使用ProSpect计算星等，并通过UFig模拟HSC图像，同时在前向建模框架下进行一致的光度特性测量。

Result: GalSBI-SPS能够重现观测到的grizy星等、颜色和大小分布，红移分布显示出轻微的偏移（0.01-0.08），并在恒星质量-SFR关系和大小-恒星质量关系上与COSMOS2020观测结果定性一致。

Abstract: Next generation photometric and spectroscopic surveys will enable
unprecedented tests of the concordance cosmological model and of galaxy
formation and evolution. Fully exploiting their potential requires a precise
understanding of the selection effects on galaxies and biases on measurements
of their properties, required, above all, for accurate estimates of redshift
distributions n(z). Forward-modelling offers a powerful framework to
simultaneously recover galaxy n(z)s and characterise the observed galaxy
population. We present GalSBI-SPS, a new SPS-based galaxy population model that
generates realistic galaxy catalogues, which we use to forward-model HSC data
in the COSMOS field. GalSBI-SPS samples galaxy physical properties, computes
magnitudes with ProSpect, and simulates HSC images in the COSMOS field with
UFig. We measure photometric properties consistently in real data and
simulations. We compare redshift distributions, photometric and physical
properties to observations and to GalSBI. GalSBI-SPS reproduces the observed
grizy magnitude, colour, and size distributions down to i<23. Median
differences in magnitudes and colours remain below 0.14 mag, with the model
covering the full colour space spanned by HSC. Galaxy sizes are offset by 0.2
arcsec on average and some tension exists in the g-r colour, but the latter is
comparable to that seen in GalSBI. Redshift distributions show a mild positive
offset (0.01-0.08) in the mean. GalSBI-SPS qualitatively reproduces the stellar
mass-SFR and size-stellar mass relations seen in COSMOS2020. GalSBI-SPS
provides a realistic, survey-independent galaxy population description at a
Stage-III depth using only parameters from the literature. Its predictive power
will improve significantly when constrained against observed data using SBI,
providing accurate redshift distributions satisfying the stringent requirements
set by Stage IV surveys.

### [2] [Redshifts of Objects near 3C 220.3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21613)
*Sóley Ó. Hyman,S. P. Willner,Belinda J. Wilkes*

**TL;DR**: 研究3C 220.3透镜系统及其附近天体的光谱数据，揭示了星系红移分布、AGN候选体以及可能的银河系-LMC类似系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 3C 220.3透镜系统及其附近天体的研究有助于理解星系群和透镜效应的背景。

Data: 使用Binospec仪器在MMT上获取的511个天体的光谱数据，以及HST的可见光和近红外成像数据。

Method: 通过光谱分析获取星系红移和恒星分类，并结合HST成像进行形态学分类。

Result: 发现146个高质量星系红移、126颗银河系恒星、12个AGN候选体（包括一个可能的z≈4.64宽线QSO），以及一个类似银河系-LMC系统的星系对。

Abstract: In the course of studying the 3C 220.3 lensing system, spectra were obtained
with the Binospec instrument on the MMT for 511 additional objects in 3C
220.3's vicinity. These gave 146 good-quality galaxy redshifts and identified
126 Galactic stars. The galaxy redshift histogram shows a peak near 3C 220.3's
redshift, but there is no evidence for or against a galaxy group within 2 Mpc
of 3C 220.3 itself. The spectra revealed 12 AGN candidates including a likely
$z\approx4.64$ broad-line QSO. Visible and near-infrared imaging with HST
allowed morphological classifications of 14 galaxies. One system is a potential
analog of the Milky Way-LMC system with stellar mass ratio $\sim$0.6.

### [3] [DAWN JWST Archive: Morphology from profile fitting of over 340,000 galaxies in major fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21622)
*Aurélien Genin,Marko Shuntov,Gabe Brammer,Natalie Allen,Kei Ito,Georgios Magdis,Jasleen Matharu,Pascal A. Oesch,Sune Toft,Francesco Valentino*

**TL;DR**: 本研究通过JWST NIRCam深场成像数据，对超过34万个星系进行了形态学测量，揭示了星系形态与恒星形成活动之间的强关联及其随红移的演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 为了更好地理解星系如何组装其结构并在宇宙时间尺度上演化，研究基于JWST NIRCam深场成像数据，对四个主要河外场（CEERS、PRIMER-UDS、PRIMER-COSMOS、GOODS）中的星系进行了形态学分析。

Data: 使用了JWST NIRCam深场成像数据，覆盖红移范围0到12，来自四个主要河外场（CEERS、PRIMER-UDS、PRIMER-COSMOS、GOODS），并整合在DAWN JWST Archive（DJA）中。

Method: 对所有星系进行了二维表面亮度拟合，采用Sérsic轮廓和双成分（核球和盘）分解模型，得到了一致的结构参数（如有效半径、Sérsic指数、轴比和核球占比B/T）。

Result: 研究发现核球主导的星系（高Sérsic指数和B/T）主要位于UVJ图的静止区域，而盘主导的星系多为恒星形成星系。静止星系在红移4时的恒星质量面密度比红移1时高近一个数量级，支持核球增长与恒星形成停止密切相关的演化模型。

Abstract: To better understand how galaxies assemble their structure and evolve over
cosmic time, we present a new catalog of morphological measurements for over
340,000 sources spanning $0 < z < 12$, derived from deep JWST NIRCam imaging
across four major extragalactic fields (CEERS, PRIMER-UDS, PRIMER-COSMOS,
GOODS) compiled in the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA). We perform two-dimensional
surface brightness fitting for all galaxies in a uniform, flux-limited sample.
Each galaxy is modeled with both a S\'ersic profile and a two-component (bulge
and disk) decomposition, yielding consistent structural parameters - including
effective radius, S\'ersic index, axis ratio, and bulge-to-total ratio ($B/T$).
To demonstrate the scientific application of our morphology catalogs, we
combined these measurements with DJA photometric redshifts, physical parameters
and rest-frame colors, and investigated the relation between total, bulge and
disk sizes, S\'ersic index ($n_S$), star formation activity, and redshift.
Bulge-dominated galaxies (high $n_S$ and $B/T$) predominantly occupy the
quiescent region of the $UVJ$ diagram, while disk-dominated galaxies are mostly
star-forming. A significant bimodality persists, with quiescent disks and
compact, bulge-dominated star-forming galaxies observed out to $z > 3$.
Quiescent galaxies also show significantly higher stellar mass surface
densities, nearly an order of magnitude greater at $z \sim 4$ than at $z \sim
1$. Our results confirm a strong and evolving link between morphology and star
formation activity, and support a scenario in which bulge growth and quenching
are closely connected. This work is a highly valuable addition to the DJA,
adding a morphological dimension to this rich dataset and thus enabling a wider
scientific application.

### [4] [Stealing galaxies from galaxy clusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21629)
*Majda Smole,Miroslav Micic,Ana Mitrašinović*

**TL;DR**: 通过IllustrisTNG300模拟研究发现，经过星系团处理的星系群（尤其是"thief groups"）在统计上表现出与普通场星系群不同的性质，如更不紧凑和更多成员。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究背景是星系群在星系团中的动力学相互作用可能导致其性质发生变化，但这类经过处理的星系群在观测上可能与普通场星系群难以区分。

Data: 研究使用了IllustrisTNG300模拟数据，涵盖总质量在8乘以10的11次方太阳质量到7乘以10的13次方太阳质量之间的星系群。

Method: 通过统计工具对模拟数据进行分析，区分了"thief groups"（捕获更多星系的处理群）和"non-thief groups"（未捕获新成员的处理群）。

Result: 研究发现，"thief groups"通常更不紧凑且包含更多成员，而"non-thief groups"与普通场星系群性质相似，难以区分。

Abstract: We investigate galaxy groups that reside in the field but have been
previously processed by galaxy clusters. Observationally, they would appear to
have the same properties as regular field groups at first glance. However, one
would expect to find quantifiable differences in processed groups as dynamical
interactions within clusters perturb them. We use IllustrisTNG300 simulation to
statistically quantify that processed groups of galaxies show different
properties compared to regular field groups. Our analysis encompasses a broad
range of groups with total masses between $8 \times 10^{11} \Msun$ and $7
\times 10^{13} \Msun$. We distinguish between processed groups that passed
through a galaxy cluster and capture more galaxies, referred to as thief
groups, and groups that did not capture any new members, referred to as
non-thief groups. The employed statistical tools show that thief groups are
generally less compact and contain more members, while non-thief groups seem to
have the same properties as the field groups which makes them
indistinguishable.

### [5] [Quasar absorption outflows on galactic scales: Insights from DESI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21630)
*Maryam Dehghanian,Nahum Arav,Mayank Sharma,Gwen Walker,Kyle Johnston,Matthew Kaupin,Justin Gandhi*

**TL;DR**: 利用DESI早期数据发布的谱线数据，分析了四个中等红移类星体中的五个低电离吸收外流系统，揭示了其物理特性、动力学参数及其在AGN反馈中的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 类星体中的吸收外流对理解活动星系核（AGN）反馈及其对星系演化的影响至关重要。DESI提供的空前光谱数据为研究这些外流开辟了新途径。

Data: 使用了DESI早期数据发布的光谱数据。

Method: 通过光致电离模型和吸收线分析，确定了离子柱密度、总氢柱密度、电子数密度和电离参数，并推导了外流距离AGN的距离及其动力学特性（质量流率、动能光度和动量通量）。

Result: 研究发现五个不同的迷你宽吸收线外流系统，其氢柱密度为log(N_H)=20.0-20.7[cm^{-2}]，电离参数为log(U_H)=-2.7至-2.1，电子数密度为log(n_e)=1.45-2.85[cm^{-2}]。外流距离中心源的距离为4.5至31 kpc，动能光度范围为2×10^{-6}至5×10^{-3}的爱丁顿光度。

Abstract: Absorption outflows in quasars play an important role in understanding active
galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback and their influence on galaxy evolution. The
unprecedented spectral data provided by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI) opens new avenues to explore these outflows. We analyze five
low-ionization absorption outflow systems in four intermediate-redshift quasars
(2 < z < 3) using the data obtained by DESI in order to characterize their
physical properties and energetics, and also to assess their role in AGN
feedback. We use the spectra from DESI's Early Data Release to determine the
ionic column densities, total hydrogen column densities, electron number
densities, and ionization parameters via photoionization modeling and
absorption line analysis. We derive the outflows' distance from the AGN, and
its kinematic properties: mass-flow rates, kinetic luminosity, and momentum
flux. Our study identifies five distinct mini-broad absorption line outflow
systems, hosted by four quasars. The identified outflows exhibit hydrogen
column densities of \log (N_H) = 20.0-20.7[cm^{-2}], ionization parameters of
log (U_H) = -2.7 to -2.1, and electron number densities of log (n_e)
=1.45-2.85[cm^{-2}]. The distances of the outflows from the central source are
between 4.5 to 31 kpc, and the kinetic luminosities range from 2\times10^{-6}
to 5\times10^{-3} of the Eddington luminosity. The outflows in J1407 and J1032
show the largest kinetic luminosities, with momentum flux ratios (\dot{p} /
\dot{p}_{rad}) of about 2 and 0.2, respectively. Our findings highlight the
vital role of DESI data in uncovering the diversity and significance of quasar
outflows in galaxy evolution.

### [6] [First IFU observations of two GRB host galaxies at cosmic noon with JWST/NIRSpec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21643)

**TL;DR**: 利用JWST/NIRSpec IFU对两个长伽马射线暴宿主星系的高分辨率观测揭示了复杂的星系相互作用环境，并提供了关于恒星形成率、金属丰度和星系特性的新见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 长伽马射线暴（GRBs）是探测遥远星系的强大工具，但其宿主星系样本存在偏差，因为它们反映了前身恒星偏好的条件。因此，表征GRB追踪的星系群体对于有效利用GRB作为探测工具以及限制长GRB前身恒星的能力至关重要。

Data: 使用了JWST/NIRSpec IFU对GRB 150403A和GRB 050820A的宿主星系进行观测，空间分辨率约为1.6 kpc，这两个星系分别位于红移z ~ 2.06和z ~ 2.61。

Method: 通过积分场单元（IFU）进行空间分辨的光谱观测，分析了星系中的星际介质和恒星群体。

Result: 观测数据揭示了两个复杂的星系环境，由两个或多个正在相互作用的恒星形成星系组成。这些星系的恒星形成率、气体相金属丰度和关键诊断线比率与其他z > 2的恒星形成星系和GRB宿主星系的性质一致，但相互作用星系之间的恒星形成率和金属丰度差异强调了空间分辨观测的重要性。

Abstract: Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) serve as powerful probes of distant galaxies.
Their luminous afterglow pinpoints galaxies independent of luminosity, in
contrast to most flux-limited surveys. Nevertheless, GRB-selected galaxy
samples are not free from bias, instead tracing the conditions favoured by the
progenitor stars. Characterising the galaxy populations traced by GRBs is
therefore important both to effectively use GRBs as probes as well as to place
stronger constraints on the progenitor stars capable of forming long GRBs.
Spatially-resolved spectroscopic observations with integral field units (IFUs)
provide valuable insights into the interstellar medium and stellar populations
of GRB host galaxies. In this paper we present results of the first two GRB
host galaxies observed with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU with a spatial resolution of ~
1.6 kpc; the hosts of GRB 150403A and GRB 050820A at redshifts z ~ 2.06 and z ~
2.61, respectively. The data reveal two complex galaxy environments made up of
two or more star forming galaxies that are likely interacting given their small
spatial separation (< 20 kpc) and line of sight velocity offsets (< 100 km/s).
The measured gas-phase metallicity, star formation rates (SFRs), and key
diagnostic line ratios for each of the detected galaxies are overall consistent
with the properties of other star forming galaxies and GRB hosts at z > 2.
However, differences in the SFR and metallicities of the interacting galaxies
highlight the importance of spatially resolved observations in order to
accurately characterise the galaxy properties traced by GRBs.

**TL;DR**: 研究发现卫星星系在星系团或星系群中心区域因强潮汐力作用，其外围质量被剥离，导致平均质量密度随距离变化，并通过模拟和观测数据验证了这一现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 卫星星系在星系团或星系群中心区域受到强潮汐力作用，导致外围质量被剥离，而中心密集区域得以保留，这一过程形成了平均质量密度随距离变化的规律。

Data: 研究使用了Virgo和Fornax星系团以及仙女座和银河系系统的观测数据。

Method: 结合半解析卫星轨道模型和宇宙学星系模拟进行分析。

Result: 研究发现卫星的平均总质量密度和平均恒星质量密度均表现出距离依赖性，且在过渡半径处存在特征性变化，与观测数据一致。

Abstract: Satellite galaxies endure powerful environmental tidal forces that drive mass
stripping of their outer regions. Consequently, satellites located in central
regions of galaxy clusters or groups, where the tidal field is strongest, are
expected to retain their central dense regions while losing their outskirts.
This process produces a spatial segregation in the mean mass density with the
cluster-centric distance (the $\bar{\rho}-r$ relation). To test this
hypothesis, we combined semi-analytical satellite orbital models with
cosmological galaxy simulations. We find that not only the mean total mass
densities ($\bar{\rho}$), but also the mean stellar mass densities
($\bar{\rho}^{\star}$) of satellites exhibit this distance-dependent
segregation ($\bar{\rho}^{\star}-r$). The correlation traces the host's tidal
field out to a characteristic transition radius at $\Re_{\star}$ $\approx$
$0.5$ $R_{\rm vir}$, beyond which the satellite population's density profile
can have a slight increase or remain flat, reflecting the weakened tidal
influence in the outskirts of galaxy clusters and beyond. We compare these
predictions with observational data from satellites in the Virgo and Fornax
galaxy clusters, as well as the Andromeda and Milky Way systems. Consistent
trends in the satellite mean stellar mass densities are observed across these
environments. Furthermore, the transition radius serves as a photometric
diagnostic tool: it identifies regions where the stellar components of
satellites underwent significant tidal processing and probes the gravitational
field strength of the host halo.

**TL;DR**: 研究利用多波段观测数据分析了M87星系周围的46 kpc尺度扩散射电瓣，揭示了其结构特征、磁场强度、年龄及能量来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域对M87星系周围的扩散射电瓣的结构和能量来源了解有限，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Data: 使用了MWA、VLA、LOFAR和Effelsberg的多波段观测数据（60 MHz-10.55 GHz）。

Method: 采用了连续注入模型（CI模型）和脉冲注入模型（JP模型）分析射电谱，并通过能量均分分析估计磁场强度。

Result: 研究发现扩散射电瓣的磁场强度约为10微高斯，年龄为30-50 Myr，能量来源主要为AGN驱动的喷流，而非恒星风。

Abstract: This study investigates the projected, quasi-symmetric $\sim\rm46\,kpc$-scale
diffuse radio lobes surrounding the giant elliptical galaxy M\,87, utilizing
well-sampled wideband ($\rm 60\,MHz-10.55\,GHz$) observations from MWA and VLA,
supplemented by data from LOFAR and Effelsberg. The observed structures feature
sharp edges and filaments, with nearly uniform and moderately steep spectral
indices ($\alpha$, mostly within $-1.2\leq\alpha\leq-0.8$), indicating
turbulence. Well-sampled radio spectra for the lobes' diffuse region are
derived using the continuous injection (CI) model (with $\alpha_{\rm
inj}\simeq-0.86$ and $\nu_{\rm b}\simeq1.72\rm\,GHz$), and for its three
localized regions using the impulsive injection model (e.g., JP model). From
energy equipartition analysis, we estimate the typical magnetic field strength
in the lobes' diffuse region to be $B_{\rm eq}\simeq10\,\mu\rm G$. The age of
the lobes is estimated as $\sim30-50\,\rm~Myr$, based on lifetimes derived from
the CI and JP models and sound crossing time. Outflow powers of
$\sim(0.2-2)\times10^{44}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ for the lobes' diffuse components
and $\sim(1-11)\times10^{44}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ for the whole source are
calculated. With this power assessment, we conclude that the galactic stellar
wind has a negligible effect, the active galactic nucleus (AGN)-driven jet can
provide the necessary energy for the whole system. Furthermore, we argue that
while the wind driven by current AGN activity is unlikely to power the lobes'
diffuse components, an average enhancement of AGN activity by a factor of $\sim
10^2$ over the past $\sim 30-50$ Myr remains plausible.

### [9] [Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS): The sSFR-M$_{\star}$plane part I: The recent SFH of galaxies and movement through the plane](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21947)
*L. J. M. Davies,J. E. Thorne,S. Bellstedt,R. H. W. Cook,M. Bravo,A. S. G. Robotham,C. del P. Lagos,S. Phillipps,M. Siudek,B. W. Holwerda,M. N. Bremer,J. D'Silva,S. P. Driver*

**TL;DR**: This study explores the movement of galaxies through the sSFR-M⋆ plane using their recent star-formation histories (SFHs), revealing distinct SFH patterns in different sub-regions and proposing a new selection methodology to better identify galaxies with common SFHs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The research builds on previous work that parameterized the evolution of star-formation rate dispersion (σSFR) across the sSFR-M⋆ plane, suggesting a boundary (M∗σ-min) between different physical mechanisms affecting galaxy evolution. The current study aims to understand how galaxy movement through the sSFR-M⋆ plane leads to the observed σSFR-M⋆ relation.

Data: The study uses data from the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS) and analyzes recent star-formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies.

Method: The authors analyze the recent SFHs of galaxies to track their movement through the sSFR-M⋆ plane and propose a new selection methodology based on stellar mass and position relative to the star-forming sequence (SFS). They also measure the evolution of the SFS using SFH data.

Result: The findings show that galaxies in different sub-regions of the sSFR-M⋆ plane exhibit distinct SFHs, leading to complex evolution of the plane and SFS. The study also reveals varying contributions from galaxies with different SFHs to the observed changes in the SFS's slope, normalization, and turnover stellar mass, and tracks the overall evolution of the sSFR-M⋆ plane from z∼1 to the present.

Abstract: In a recent paper we parameterised the evolution of the star-formation rate
dispersion ($\sigma_{SFR}$) across the specific star-formation rate - stellar
mass plane (sSFR-M$_{\star}$) using the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy
Survey (DEVILS) - suggesting that the point at which the minimum in the
dispersion occurs (M$^{*}_{\sigma-min}$) defines a boundary between different
physical mechanisms affecting galaxy evolution. Here we expand upon that work
to determine the movement of galaxies through the sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane using
their recent star-formation histories (SFHs) and explore how this leads to the
observed $\sigma_{SFR}$-M$_{\star}$ relation. We find that galaxies in
sub-regions of the sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane show distinctly different SFHs,
leading to a complex evolution of the sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane and star-forming
sequence (SFS). However, we find that selecting galaxies based on stellar mass
and position relative to SFS alone (as is traditionally the case), may not
identify sources with common recent SFHs, and therefore propose a new selection
methodology. We then use the recent SFH of galaxies to measure the evolution of
the SFS, showing that it has varying contributions from galaxies with different
SFHs that lead to the observed changes in slope, normalisation and turnover
stellar mass. Finally, we determine the overall evolution of the
sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane from $z\sim1$ to today. In the second paper in this
series we will discuss physical properties of galaxies with common recent SFHs
and how these lead to the observed $\sigma_{SFR}$-M$_{\star}$ relation and
evolution of the sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane.

**TL;DR**: 本文通过比较具有相似近期恒星形成历史的星系性质，探讨了在特定恒星形成率-恒星质量平面（sSFR-M⋆）上星系运动的物理机制，发现低质量星系和高质量星系的运动机制存在显著差异，且AGN反馈是导致高质量星系高SFR离散值的主要驱动因素。

Background: 在系列研究的第一部分中，作者利用深空外可见遗留巡天（DEVILS）讨论了特定恒星形成率-恒星质量平面（sSFR-M⋆）上恒星形成历史（SFHs）的变化。本文进一步探讨了这些观测趋势背后的物理机制。

Data: 使用了深空外可见遗留巡天（DEVILS）的数据。

Method: 通过比较具有相似近期恒星形成历史（SFH）形状的星系性质，分析了星系在sSFR-M⋆平面上的运动机制。

Result: 研究发现，星系在sSFR-M⋆平面上的运动机制可分为两个恒星质量区间，低质量星系的观测结果主要由随机恒星形成过程和绝对sSFR值的多样性导致，而高质量星系的高SFR离散值与活动星系核（AGN）反馈导致的恒星形成历史快速下降相关，表明AGN反馈是星系淬灭的主要驱动因素。

Abstract: In part I of this series we discussed the variation of star-formation
histories (SFHs) across the specific star formation rate - stellar mass plane
(sSFR-M$_{\star}$) using the Deep Extragalactic VIsible Legacy Survey (DEVILS).
Here we explore the physical mechanisms that are likely driving these
observational trends, by comparing the properties of galaxies with common
recent SFH shapes. Overall, we find that the processes shaping the movement of
galaxies through the sSFR-M$_{\star}$ plane can be be largely split into two
stellar mass regimes, bounded by the minimum SFR dispersion ($\sigma_{SFR}$)
point. At lower stellar masses we find that large $\sigma_{SFR}$ values are
likely observed due to a combination of stochastic star-formation processes and
a large variety in absolute sSFR values, but relatively constant/flat SFHs.
While at higher stellar masses we see strong observational evidence that Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are associated with rapidly declining SFHs, and that
these galaxies reside in the high $\sigma_{SFR}$ region of the plane. As such,
we suggest that AGN feedback, leading to galaxy quenching, is the primary
driver of the high $\sigma_{SFR}$ values. These results are consistent with
previous theoretical interpretations of the $\sigma_{SFR}$-M$_{\star}$
relation.

the CGM with different gas flows (shearing, coherent, and static) and diverse
physical properties to track gas mixing and find that shearing flows generally
exhibit a higher dye spread. We then correlate the extent and shape of dye
spread with local gas properties for a generalised understanding of gas mixing.
The velocity dispersion and magnitude of traceless symmetric shear (shear
deformation) tensors in small regions (<5 kpc) around the dye injection
locations most accurately predict the extent of dye spread after 200 Myr
(Spearman rank 0.87). We use this to determine diffusivity calibration
constants for subgrid-scale mixing models. While the dye shape after 200 Myr
aligns well with velocity and magnetic field dispersion, the best alignment
occurs with the dispersion of eigenvectors representing stretching (from
traceless symmetric shear tensor) and plane-of-rotation (from antisymmetric
shear or vorticity tensor) in large regions (>10 kpc) around the dye injection
locations. Therefore, shear-related statistics and velocity dispersion are the
properties best able to predict both the extent and shape of mixed gas in our
simulations. Our dyes spread roughly linearly with time, suggesting
superdiffusive behaviour in the CGM, potentially due to turbulent and
large-scale coherent flows. We calculate physical Reynolds numbers of 10^2-10^3
using gas properties in the CGM of our simulations, which a resolution of a few
hundred pc could resolve, but our 1 kpc resolution leads to significant
numerical mixing. However, our correlation results are robust to changes in
resolution. These results can be used to predict diffusion coefficients from
local gas properties to model processes like magnetic field diffusion, heat
transport, and metal mixing.

**TL;DR**: 研究Abell星系团A496中晚型星系的紫外辐射和冷气体特性，揭示了星系演化过程中的五个阶段及其主导机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 晚型星系在落入星系团时会经历多种演化机制，研究其紫外辐射和冷气体特性有助于理解短寿命星暴和星系熄灭的演化过程。

Data: 使用了UVIT-AstroSat观测的Abell星系团A496中心区域的两个28'视场数据，以及NRAO VLA的HI数据。

Method: 通过分析FUV和HI数据，结合特定恒星形成率（sSFR）和星系质量，研究了星系演化的机制。

Result: 发现FUV检测到的星系通常具有较高的sSFR，高sSFR的大质量星系主要受RPS机制影响，而低质量星系则受潮汐相互作用影响；提出了星系演化的五个阶段序列，并指出这一过程可在几亿年内完成。

Abstract: During the fall of late-type galaxies into clusters, they can experiment a
variety of evolutionary mechanisms according their local environment.
Consequently, studying the UV emission and the cold gas of late-type galaxies
provide key insights in the evolution of short-lived starburst and galaxy
quenching. In this work, we conduted a study of two 28' fields observed with
UVIT-AstroSat in the central region of the Abell cluster A496 ($z=0.033$),
including HI, data from NRAO VLA. We reported 22 cluster members detected in
FUV; all of them are detected in HI, or have upper limits for the HI-mass. We
find our FUV detected galaxies generally have higher specific star formation
rates than other star forming galaxies. Most of the FUV galaxies with masses
above 10$^9 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$,and showing high sSFR have no close neighbors,
pointing at RPS as the dominant mechanism affecting them. In contrast, most of
the low-mass FUV objects present at least one companion, suggesting that tidal
interactions also play an important role in the triggering of infalling
galaxies. Combining the FUV-SFR with the HI properties of the observed galaxies
in A496 we identify an evolutionary sequence consisting of five stages: (1)
Pre-triggering, (2) Initial SF-triggering, (3) Peak of star-formation, (4)
SF-fading, and (5) SF-quenching. During this path, normal gas-rich objects
reach a gas-deficiency phase with SFR well below the main sequence. This
process, prior to becoming a full passive galaxy, can be accomplished within a
few 10$^{8}$ yr.

Data: ALMA对马头星云中H2S、S2H、SO2、CO+和SH+的总功率图像数据。

Result: 首次检测到SH+和CO+，并发现S2H的发射源于光解离前沿附近的暖气体层，表明其形成可能源于非热过程从辐照颗粒表面解吸，而非涉及SH+和H2S的气相反应。

Abstract: Sulfur is essential for life, but its abundance and distribution in the
interstellar medium remain uncertain, with over 90% of sulfur undetected in
cold molecular clouds. Sulfur allotropes (S$_{\rm n}$) have been proposed as
possible reservoirs, but the only detected interstellar molecule with a
disulfide bond is S$_2$H in the Horsehead Nebula, making the estimation of
sulfur chains abundances difficult. Here we present total-power ALMA images of
H$_2$S, S$_2$H, SO$_2$, CO$^+$, and SH$^+$ towards the Horsehead nebula. These
observations, with unprecedented sensitivity (rms $\sim$ 1.5 mK), provide the
first detections of SH$^+$ and CO$^+$ in this region, together with the
identification of a new S$_2$H line. The comparison of the spectroscopic images
of H$_2$S, S$_2$H, SO$_2$, CO$^+$ and SH$^+$ shows that the S$_2$H emission
originates from a warm gas layer adjacent to the photodissociation front. The
emission peak of S$_2$H is offset from those of reactive ions such as SH$^+$,
CO$^+$, and SO$^+$, suggesting that gas-phase reactions involving SH$^+$ and
H$_2$S are not the dominant formation pathway of S$_2$H. Instead, we propose
that S$_2$H is desorbed from irradiated grain surfaces by non-thermal
processes. The SH$^+$ detection indicates that sulfur is not significantly
depleted at the UV-irradiated edge of the molecular cloud, arguing against a
major refractory sulfur reservoir in the interior of molecular clouds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 射电连续谱图像在天文学研究中具有重要意义，但现有数据在深度和分辨率上仍有不足。本研究通过改进的校准流程和更深的图像深度，填补了这一空白，并探讨了射电源的光谱特性与物理参数之间的关系。

Data: 研究使用了Apertif在1.4 GHz波段获得的Lockman Hole和ELAIS-N区域的射电连续谱图像，以及LOFAR深场在150 MHz波段的数据。

Method: 研究采用了方向依赖的校准流程生成图像，并通过交叉匹配Apertif和LOFAR深场数据，构建了一个包含10196个共同射电源的均匀样本。

Result: 研究发现，活动星系核的光谱指数与红移之间的相关性可能源于Malmquist偏差，反映了射电光度与光谱指数之间的内在关系；同时，光谱指数与线源尺寸之间也存在相关性，更紧凑的源具有更陡的光谱。

Abstract: We present two new radio continuum images obtained with Apertif at 1.4 GHz.
The images, produced with a direction-dependent calibration pipeline, cover 136
square degrees of the Lockman Hole and 24 square degrees of the ELAIS-N fields,
with an average resolution of 17x12" and residual noise of 33 uJy/beam. With
the improved depth of the images we found in total 63692 radio sources, many of
which are detected for the first time at this frequency. With the addition of
the previously published Apertif catalog for the Bootes field, we cross-match
with the LOFAR deep-fields value-added catalogs at 150 MHz, resulting in a
homogeneous sample of 10196 common sources with spectral index estimates, one
of the largest to date. We analyze and discuss the correlations between
spectral index, redshift, linear sources size, and radio luminosity, taking
into account biases of flux-density-limited surveys. Our results suggest that
the observed correlation between spectral index and redshift of active galactic
nuclei can be attributed to the Malmquist bias reflecting an intrinsic relation
between radio luminosity and the spectral index. We also find a correlation
between spectral index and linear source size with more compact sources having
steeper spectra.

*Lucas Hallgren,Radoslaw Wojtak,Jens Hjorth,Charles L. Steinhardt*

**TL;DR**: The study examines the robustness of the exponential model for host-galaxy extinction corrections in type Ia supernovae, revealing significant differences between late- and early-type galaxies and highlighting potential biases in current universal prior assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Precise cosmological constraints from type Ia supernovae rely on accurate corrections for host-galaxy extinction, but disentangling supernova intrinsic colors from host-galaxy interstellar reddening remains challenging. Current methods use a universal exponential prior for reddening across all host galaxy types, which may not be universally applicable.

Data: The study uses simulated dust and type Ia supernova distributions in host galaxies of different morphological types, comparing these predictions with observational data from type Ia supernovae.

Method: The research tests the robustness of the exponential model for host-galaxy extinction by simulating dust and supernova distributions in various host galaxy types and comparing the results with observational data.

Result: The findings show significant differences in reddening between late- and early-type host galaxies, driven by stellar-to-dust mass ratios, and reveal biases in current universal prior assumptions, suggesting the need for more tailored extinction models.

Abstract: Precise cosmological constraints from type Ia supernovae require adequately
accurate corrections for host-galaxy extinction. Modelling these corrections is
challenged by the problem of disentangling supernova intrinsic colours from
host-galaxy interstellar reddening.The latter is commonly modelled in a
probabilistic way assuming an exponential distribution exp(-E(B-V)/\tau) as a
universal prior which is applied across all types of supernova host galaxies.
We test the robustness of the exponential model and its universality against
predictions based on simulating dust and type Ia supernova distributions in
host galaxies of different morphological types. We find substantial differences
between predicted interstellar reddening in late- and early-type host galaxies,
primarily driven by the stellar-to-dust mass ratios. The mean simulated
reddening in late-type galaxies matches well those derived from type Ia
supernova observations, but it is significantly lower for early-type host
galaxies. The reddening distributions exhibit an excess of sight lines with
vanishing reddening with respect to the exponential model, although the
difference is quite mild for late-type galaxies. On the other hand, the
distribution may peak at E(B-V)>0 when considering a population of young type
Ia supernovae originating from lower heights within the dust disc. We
demonstrate that assuming a universal reddening prior distribution for modeling
peak magnitude-colour relation, which is currently a common practice, gives
rise to a spurious scatter in the derived extinction properties. It may also
bias relative distances between supernovae originating from different
host-galaxy populations. The discrepancy between the simulated reddening in
average early-type host galaxies and the observed occurrence of reddened
supernovae suggests that reddening does not originate from interstellar dust
expected in these galaxies.

**TL;DR**: 研究发现，12个明亮的亚毫米星系（SMGs）的恒星形成率（SFR）通过低频射电辐射测量显著低于通过多波段SED拟合的结果，表明其与星系主序的偏离程度减小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 明亮的亚毫米星系（SMGs）在红移z=2-4时对恒星形成率密度（20-50%）和恒星质量密度（30-50%）贡献显著，但其高恒星形成率与标准星系形成和演化模型难以调和。

Data: 研究使用了来自NEPSC2调查的12个明亮SMGs样本，并通过国际LOFAR望远镜（ILT）在144 MHz下进行了高分辨率成像。

Method: 通过低频射电辐射作为恒星形成的代理，与多波段SED拟合结果进行比较，并分离了与活动星系核（AGN）相关的射电辐射。

Result: 研究发现射电测量的SFR比SED拟合结果低约5倍（中值），且这些SMGs与星系主序的偏离程度显著减小，仅比主序星系高2倍。

Abstract: Bright SMGs contribute significantly to the star formation rate (SFR) density
(20-50\%) and stellar mass density ($\sim$ 30-50\%) at $z=$ 2-4 with SFRs$\ge
1000$ M$_\odot$,yr$^{-1}$ and stellar masses of $\sim 10^{11}$-$10^{12}$
M$_\odot$. The number of bright SMGs with such high SFRs is hard to reconcile
with the standard models of galaxy formation and evolution. In this paper we
provide evidence that, in a small sample of 12 bright SMGs, the SFRs derived
from spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting are significantly higher than
those obtained using low-frequency radio emission as a proxy for star
formation. Using the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT), which allows imaging
at 144 MHz with sub-arcsecond angular resolution, we have produced deep images
of a small sample of bright SMGs in the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) field
extracted from the NEPSC2 survey. For all 12 SMGs, we find radio-emitting
mid-infrared galaxies at distances from a few arcseconds down to sub-arcsecond
scales from the SMG and/or the presence of a radio-emitting AGN. The SFRs
derived from the radio emission of the SMG, disentangled from the AGN-related
radio emission, are systematically lower by a factor of $\sim 5$ (median value)
than those derived from the multi-band SED fitting. We discuss whether our
assumptions might be, at least in part, responsible for the observed
discrepancy. We argue that the radio-derived SFRs are not systematically
underestimated but can be affected by a significant dispersion ($0.3-0.5$ dex).
Considering these new SFR estimates, the offset of the specific SFR of the 12
bright SMGs from the star-forming galaxy main sequence
($\Delta\mathrm{(SSFR)}$) is significantly reduced, with all 12 bright SMGs
which are only a factor of 2 more star-forming than the main sequence galaxies.

Abstract: The chemical composition of exoplanets is thought to be influenced by the
composition of the disks in which they form. JWST observations have unveiled a
variety of species in numerous nearby disks, showing significant variations in
the C/O abundance ratio. However, little is known about the composition and C/O
ratio of disks around young stars in clusters exposed to strong ultraviolet
(UV) radiation from nearby massive stars, which are representative of the
environments where most planetary systems form, including ours. We present JWST
spectroscopy of d203-504, a young 0.7 $\rm M_{\odot}$ star in the Orion Nebula
with a 30 au disk irradiated by nearby massive stars. These observations reveal
spectroscopic signatures of CO, H$_2$O, CH$_3^+$, and PAHs. Water and CO are
detected in absorption in the inner disk ($r\lesssim 1$ au), where the
estimated gas-phase C/O ratio is 0.48, consistent with the Solar value and that
of the Orion Nebula. In contrast, \ch{CH3+} and PAHs are found in the extended
surface layers of the disk. These results suggest that gas in the inner disk is
chemically shielded from UV radiation while the surface layers of the disk
experience UV-induced chemistry, potentially depleting their carbon content.

Abstract: The recent discovery of a large number of massive black holes within the
first two billion years after the Big Bang, as well as their peculiar
properties, have been largely unexpected based on the extrapolation of the
properties of luminous quasars. These findings have prompted the development of
several theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes,
which are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity
measurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift
7.04, hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the
[OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow Hbeta emission indicates an
extremely low chemical enrichment, less than 0.01 solar. We argue that such
properties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early
cosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has
developed a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models
assuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or
super-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations,
although they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in rare cases.
Models invoking "primordial black holes" (i.e. putative black holes formed
shortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment
associated with this black hole.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: “小红点”（LRDs）是JWST最近发现的一类活动星系核（AGNs），其紧凑形态和红色光学连续谱发射通常被解释为显著的尘埃消光（AV ≥ 3 mag）。然而，这种尘埃消光AGN的假设因其微弱的近远红外发射和可能的“尘埃预算危机”而受到挑战。

Data: 本研究使用了JWST MIRI、Herschel和ALMA的观测数据。

Method: 通过模拟不同消光规律和广泛尘埃分布参数下的紫外到红外光谱，并将预测的红外通量与观测数据进行比较，重新评估了LRDs的尘埃消光水平。

Result: 研究发现，在SMC消光规律下，A2744-45924和RUBIES-BLAGN-1的视觉消光值分别被严格限制在AV ≤ 1.0 mag和AV ≤ 1.5 mag，且紫外范围内灰色消光的约束稍弱。修正后的AV值表明LRDs的辐射效率为10%，缓解了与Soltan论证的紧张关系，并为理解早期宇宙中大质量黑洞的性质和环境提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Little red dots (LRDs), a population of active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
recently identified by JWST, are characterized by their compact morphology and
red optical continuum emission, which is often interpreted as evidence for
significant dust extinction of $A_V \gtrsim 3$ mag. However, the dust-reddened
AGN scenario is increasingly challenged by their faint near-to-far infrared
emission and a potential "dust budget crisis" in cases when the host galaxy is
either undetectably low-mass or absent. In this study, we re-evaluate the dust
extinction level in LRDs by modeling the UV-to-infrared spectra for various
extinction laws and a broad range of dusty distribution parameters. Comparing
the predicted infrared fluxes with observational data from the JWST MIRI,
Herschel, and ALMA, our analysis finds that the visual extinction is tightly
constrained to $A_V \lesssim 1.0$ mag for A2744-45924 and $A_V \lesssim 1.5$
mag for RUBIES-BLAGN-1 under the SMC extinction laws, with slightly weaker
constraints for those with gray extinction in the UV range. The revised $A_V$
values yield a radiative efficiencies of $10\%$ for the LRD population, easing
the tension with the Soltan argument for the bulk AGN population at lower
redshifts. Moreover, this moderate extinction (or dust-free) scenario, with
reprocessed emission spectra testable by future far-infrared observatories,
provides a paradigm shift in understanding their natures, environments, and
evolutionary pathways of massive black holes in the early universe.

Background: NGC 6814的光谱和时间分析是研究X射线与紫外辐射之间关系的重要课题，过去的研究对其吸积盘结构和X射线源的性质提出了多种假设。

Data: 使用了AstroSat 2019年和XMM-Newton 2021年的观测数据，包括FUV（1541 Å）、UVW1（2910 Å）和X射线数据。

Method: 采用了交叉相关分析、宽带SED建模（使用KYNSED模型）以及时间延迟计算等方法。

Result: 研究发现X射线与紫外辐射之间存在约15 ks和30 ks的时间延迟，支持了X射线在灯柱几何框架下照射吸积盘的假设，且不需要假设吸积盘的外缘或内缘被截断。

Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive spectral and timing analysis of NGC 6814 using
AstroSat's 2019 and XMM-Newton's 2021 observations. Cross-correlation analysis
revealed a significant correlation between FUV (1541 \AA)/X-ray and UVW1 (2910
\AA)/X-ray variations, with delays of $\sim 15~\rm{ks}$ and $30~\rm{ks}$,
respectively. We constructed four broadband SEDs after applying aperture
correction (for the UVIT filter), subtracting host galaxy and emission line
contributions from UV flux, and using mean X-ray spectra alongside selected UV
data points. First, we fitted the SEDs with KYNSED model assuming various
combinations of inclination, $\theta$, color correction factors, $f_{\rm col}$,
and BH spins. Best-fit models were achieved for $\theta=70^{\circ}$ (consistent
with past estimates for this source) and for spin $\leq 0.5$, while $f_{\rm
col}$ is not constrained. KYNSED provided satisfactory fit to all SEDs in the
case when the corona is powered by the accretion process, with $\sim 10-20$% of
the accretion power transferred to the corona, $\dot{m}/\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}\sim
0.1$, corona radius of $\sim 6-10~r_g$, and height of $\sim7.5-35~r_g$. Model
time-lags computed using the SED best-fit results are aligned well with the
observed time-lags. Although some of the model parameters are not constrained,
the important result of our work is that both the broadband X-ray/UV spectra
and the X-ray/UV time-lags in NGC 6814 are consistent with the hypothesis of
X-ray illumination of the disc in a lamp-post geometry framework. Within this
model framework, we do not need to assume an outer or inner truncated disc.

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过分析年轻孤立脉冲星的运动和距离数据，推断中子星形成时的初始速度分布，发现其符合对数正态分布，峰值在150-200 km/s，并解决了与先前研究结果的矛盾。

Background: 中子星（NSs）在超新星爆发形成时被认为会受到初始速度（natal kicks）的影响，研究这些速度的大小对于理解中子星的形成和演化具有重要意义。

Data: 研究使用了年轻孤立脉冲星的自行运动和距离估计数据（通过视差或色散测量）。

Method: 通过分析脉冲星的三维速度分布，采用对数正态分布拟合方法，并利用先前建立的通过银河系轨迹偏心率推断速度的方法。

Result: 研究发现年轻脉冲星的速度分布符合对数正态分布，峰值在150-200 km/s，并解决了与Hobbs等人（2005年）研究结果的矛盾，表明先前发现的双峰分布并不具有统计显著性。

Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are thought to receive natal kicks at their formation in
supernovae. In order to investigate the magnitude of these kicks, we analyze
the proper motions and distance estimates -- either through parallax or
dispersion measures -- of young isolated pulsars and infer their
three-dimensional velocities relative to their local standard of rest. We find
that the velocities based on parallax distances of pulsars younger than $10$
Myr follow a log-normal distribution with a mean of
$\ln\left(v/\text{km}/\text{s}^{-1}\right)=5.60\pm0.12$ and a standard
deviation of $0.68\pm0.10$, peaking at ${\sim}150$--$200$ km s$^{-1}$, which we
adopt as our fiducial kick distribution. Using a previously established method
that infers kick magnitudes through the eccentricity of Galactic trajectories,
we also estimate the kick velocities of older pulsars, which we find to be
consistent with our fiducial kick distribution. A log-normal fit to all pulsars
with ages below $40$ Myr yields a more constraining (but possibly more prone to
systematic errors) fit with mean and standard deviation of $5.67\pm0.10$ and
$0.59\pm0.08$, respectively. Moreover, we (1) resolve the tension between our
results and the Maxwellian distribution found by Hobbs et al. (2005), which has
a ${\sim}50\%$ higher median velocity, by showing that their analysis is
missing a Jacobian needed to correct for its logarithmic histogram bin sizes,
and (2) argue that the bimodality found by others is not statistically
significant and that previous results are consistent with our inferred kick
distribution, effectively reconciling the literature on observed NS kicks.

### [22] [Deuterated water abundance in the young hot core RCW 120 S2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21945)
*Maria. S. Kirsanova,Anastasiia A. Farafontova*

**TL;DR**: 通过APEX望远镜观测RCW 120 S2热核中的HDO丰度，发现其值较低，表明该区域的恒星形成仍处于早期阶段。

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 由于水分子发射无法从地球观测，研究使用H2^18O和HDO等同位素分子追踪恒星形成区域中的水。

Data: 使用APEX望远镜的nFLASH230接收器在200-255 GHz范围内观测RCW 120 S2热核。

Method: 通过检测RCW 120 S2中的两条HDO谱线，分析其强度和激发温度。

Result: HDO柱密度范围为3.9-7.9×10^13 cm^-3，丰度为1.5×10^-9，表明RCW 120 S2的恒星形成仍处于早期阶段。

Abstract: Since the emission of water molecules cannot be observed from Earth, less
abundant isotopologues, such as H$_2^{18}$O and HDO, are used to trace water in
star-forming regions. The main aim of this study is to determine HDO abundance
in the hot core RCW 120 S2. We performed observations of the hot core in the
200-255~GHz range using the nFLASH230 receiver on the APEX telescope. Two HDO
lines were detected toward RCW 120 S2. Their intensities are described by
excitation temperature $286\pm2$~K and gas number density $\geq
10^9$~cm$^{-3}$. The emission originates from the hot core rather than the warm
dense envelope surrounding a central young stellar object. The HDO column
density ranges from $(3.9-7.9)\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$ with a most probable
value $5.6\times10^{13}$~cm$^{-3}$. The HDO abundance relative to hydrogen
nuclei is $1.5\times10^{-9}$. This HDO abundance value is among the lowest
reported for hot cores. Combined with the non-detection of the H$_2^{18}$O
line, we conclude that protostellar heating in RCW 120 S2 is still in its early
stages.

### [23] [The stellar evolution perspective on the metallicity dependence of classical Cepheid Leavitt laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22512)
*Saniya Khan,Richard I. Anderson,Sylvia Ekström,Cyril Georgy,Louise Breuval*

**TL;DR**: 本文通过合成造父变星种群分析金属丰度对Leavitt定律的影响，揭示了金属丰度与斜率及截距的依赖关系，并与观测数据进行了比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 金属丰度对造父变星Leavitt定律（LL）以及哈勃常数的影响一直是近期争论的焦点。

Data: 使用了296个共龄种群的数据，这些种群代表了太阳、大麦哲伦云（LMC）和小麦哲伦云（SMC）的金属丰度（Z ∈ [0.014, 0.006, 0.002]）。

Method: 基于Geneva模型和SYCLIST工具计算合成造父变星种群，考虑了旋转速率和伴星分布的多样性，并在14个光学到红外波段及5个无红化Wesenheit星等中计算了Leavitt定律。

Result: 模拟结果显示金属丰度对Leavitt定律斜率有显著影响（βM > 0），且截距依赖关系（αM）与基准周期相关；与SH0ES距离阶梯在H波段Wesenheit星等中的测量结果（-0.217 ± 0.046）吻合良好（αM = -0.20 ± 0.03 mag dex⁻¹）。

Abstract: The impact of metallicity on the Cepheid Leavitt law (LL) and, in turn, the
Hubble constant, has been the subject of much recent debate. Here, we present a
comprehensive analysis of metallicity effects on Cepheid LLs based on synthetic
Cepheid populations computed using Geneva models and the SYCLIST tool. We
computed 296 co-eval populations in the age range of 5-300 Myr for
metallicities representative of the Sun, the LMC, and the SMC ($Z \in [0.014,
0.006, 0.002]$). We computed LLs in fourteen optical-to-infrared passbands and
five reddening-free Wesenheit magnitudes. All Cepheid populations take into
account distributions of rotation rates and companion stars. We show excellent
agreement between the predicted populations and key observational constraints
from the literature. Our simulations predict a significant LL slope-metallicity
dependence ($\beta_{\rm M} > 0$) that renders LLs steeper at lower metallicity
at all wavelengths. Importantly, $\beta_{\rm M} \ne 0$ implies that the
intercept-metallicity dependence, $\alpha_{\rm M}$, depends on pivot period; an
issue not previously considered. Comparison with $\alpha_{\rm M}$ measurements
in individual passbands reported in the literature yields acceptable agreement
on the order of agreement found among different observational studies. The
wavelength dependence and magnitude of the disagreement suggests a possible
origin in reddening-related systematics. Conversely, we report excellent
agreement between our $\alpha_{\rm M} = -0.20 \pm 0.03$ mag dex$^{-1}$ and the
value determined by the SH0ES distance ladder in the reddening-free H-band
Wesenheit magnitude ($-0.217 \pm 0.046$), the currently tightest and
conceptually simplest empirical constraint.

**TL;DR**: 通过模拟300个质量约为7×10^14M⊙的星系团，研究了星系团的重子分数和热气体分数与总质量的关系及其演化，发现幂律关系无法准确描述这些关系，而抛物线或对数形式更适用。

Background: 星系团的重子分数和热气体分数是研究宇宙学参数和星系团内等离子体物理的重要工具，但目前对这些分数与总质量的关系及其演化的理解仍不完善。

Data: 使用了The Three Hundred合作项目中的约300个模拟星系团数据，质量中位数约为7×10^14M⊙，覆盖了从z∼0到z∼1.3的演化。

Method: 通过三种解析形式（线性、二次和对数）拟合模拟数据，分析了重子分数和热气体分数与总质量的关系及其演化。

Abstract: The baryon fraction of galaxy clusters is a powerful tool to inform on the
cosmological parameters while the hot-gas fraction provides indications on the
physics of the intracluster plasma and its interplay with the processes driving
galaxy formation. Using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from The Three
Hundred collaboration of about 300 simulated massive galaxy clusters with
median mass $M_{500}\approx7 \times 10^{14}$M$_{\odot}$ at $z=0$, we model the
relations between total mass and either baryon fraction or the hot gas
fractions at overdensities $\Delta = 2500$, $500$, and $200$ with respect to
the cosmic critical density, and their evolution from $z\sim 0$ to $z\sim 1.3$.
We fit the simulation results for such scaling relations against three analytic
forms (linear, quadratic, and logarithmic in a logarithmic plane) and three
forms for the redshift dependence, considering as a variable both the inverse
of cosmic scale factor, $(1+z)$, and the Hubble expansion rate, $E(z)$. We show
that power-law dependencies on cluster mass poorly describe the investigated
relations. A power-law fails to simultaneously capture the flattening of the
total baryon and gas fractions at high masses, their drop at the low masses,
and the transition between these two regimes. The other two functional forms
provide a more accurate description of the curvature in mass scaling. The
fractions measured within smaller radii exhibit a stronger evolution than those
measured within larger radii. From the analysis of these simulations, we
conclude that as long as we include systems in the mass range herein
investigated, the baryon or gas fraction can be accurately related to the total
mass through either a parabola or a logarithm in the logarithmic plane. The
trends are common to all modern hydro simulations, although the amplitude of
the drop at low masses might differ [Abridged].

**TL;DR**: 本文总结了修正牛顿动力学（MOND）在观测中的优缺点，认为尽管存在不足，它仍具有研究价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 修正牛顿动力学（MOND）是暗物质假说的替代理论，试图通过修改物体动力学来解决天体物理学和宇宙学中的“缺失引力”问题。自1983年提出以来，MOND在解释某些标准宇宙学难以理解的现象（如星系径向动力学中的径向加速度关系）上表现优异，但在其他方面（如星系团的质量差异、太阳系的约束条件以及非径向运动的预测）表现不佳。

Data: 本文未明确提及具体数据，但讨论了MOND在星系径向动力学、星系团质量差异、太阳系约束条件和非径向运动等方面的观测表现。

Method: 本文主要采用文献综述的方法，总结了MOND在不同观测条件下的表现。

Result: 尽管MOND在解释某些现象上表现优异，但在其他方面存在不足；作者认为MOND仍具有研究价值，可能从中获得关键见解。

Abstract: Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is an alternative to the dark matter
hypothesis that attempts to explain the "missing gravity" problem in
astrophysics and cosmology through a modification to objects' dynamics. Since
its conception in 1983, MOND has had a chequered history. Some phenomena
difficult to understand in standard cosmology MOND explains remarkably well,
most notably galaxies' radial dynamics encapsulated in the Radial Acceleration
Relation. But for others it falls flat -- mass discrepancies in clusters are
not fully accounted for, the Solar System imposes a constraint on the shape of
the MOND modification seemingly incompatible with that from galaxies, and
non-radial motions are poorly predicted. An experiment that promised to be
decisive -- the wide binary test -- has produced mainly confusion. This article
summarises the good, the bad and the ugly of MOND's observational existence. I
argue that despite its imperfections it does possess ongoing relevance: there
may yet be crucial insight to be gleaned from it.

### [26] [Ito calculus meets the Hubble tension: Effects of small-scale electron density fluctuations on the CMB anisotropies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22242)
*Jens Chluba,Geoffrey Vasil,Richard Battye*

**TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种新形式主义，研究超小尺度电子密度波动对宇宙微波背景（CMB）各向异性的影响，并发现其对重组历史的修正和散射速率的降低两种新效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域关注宇宙微波背景（CMB）各向异性的形成机制，尤其是电子密度波动在超小尺度上的影响。现有研究未能充分探讨这些波动对CMB观测结果的潜在影响，尤其是在早期结构形成增强的宇宙学模型中。

Data: 研究使用了宇宙微波背景（CMB）的各向异性数据。

Method: 作者开发了一种新形式主义，将电子场作为独立随机变量处理，并利用伊藤微积分获得光子玻尔兹曼方程的系综平均。

Result: 研究发现电子密度波动会导致汤姆逊可见度函数的修正和散射速率的降低，这些效应在LCDM模型中较弱，但在早期结构形成增强的宇宙学模型中可能显著。研究还讨论了这些效应对哈勃张力的潜在影响。

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel formalism to include the effect of electron
density fluctuations at ultra small scales (well below the sound horizon at
last scattering) on the observed anisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB). We treat the electron field as an independent stochastic
variable and obtain the required ensemble-averaged photon Boltzmann equations
using Ito calculus. Beyond changes to the average recombination history (which
can be incorporated in the standard approach) our work identifies two new
effects caused by the clumpiness of the medium. The first is a correction to
the Thomson visibility function caused by correlations of the electron
fluctuations along the line of sight, leading to an additional broadening of
the visibility towards higher redshifts which causes extra damping and smearing
of the CMB anisotropies. The second effect is a reduction of the effective
scattering rate in the (pre-)recombination era that affects the photon transfer
functions in a non-trivial manner. These new effects are subdominant in LCDM
but can be significant in cosmologies with an early onset of structure
formation (e.g., due to generation of enhanced small-scale power) as suggested
by a number of indicators (e.g., the abundance of high redshift galaxies
observed by JWST). We discuss the relevance of these new effects to the Hubble
tension, finding that corrections which cannot be captured by simple
modifications to the average recombination history arise. This highlights how
important an understanding of the recombination process is in cosmological
inference, and that a coordinated simulation and analysis campaign is required
as part of the search for the origin of the various tensions in cosmology.
