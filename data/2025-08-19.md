Abstract: Accurate correction for extinction by Galactic dust is essential for studying
the extragalactic sky. In the low-extinction regions of the Ursa Major
molecular cloud complex, we demonstrate that Galactic dust reddening maps
constructed from observations of far-infrared emission are insensitive to
variations in the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and, as
a result, to PAH-induced variations in reddening. Using galaxy counts to
validate various reddening maps, we find evidence that maps based on
far-infrared emission erroneously under-predict reddening compared to stellar
reddening maps. This underestimation by far-infrared emission based reddening
maps -- representing the largest discrepancy between maps of up to
$E(B-V)=0.08$ mag -- is correlated with the relative brightness of PAH
emission. Furthermore, we demonstrate theoretically that changes in PAH
abundance via accretion from the gas phase is capable of altering extinction
significantly with only minor changes to far-infrared emission. We show that
modeling the extinction of Ursa Major using both far-infrared and mid-infrared
emission more accurately traces dust extinction variations due to changes in
PAH abundance. Finally, we discuss how SPHEREx observations of the 3.3 $\mu$m
PAH feature are a promising way to overcome this limitation of far-infrared
emission.

Abstract: We present a quantitative spectroscopic study of 13 blue supergiant stars in
the Pinwheel Galaxy M101, based on data obtained with the Low Resolution
Imaging Spectrometer available at the Keck I telescope. The average stellar
metallicity decreases from ~1.9 Zsun near the center of the galaxy to ~0.3 Zsun
at the optical outskirts. The galactocentric radial metallicity gradient is
statistically consistent with previous studies of the gas-phase oxygen
abundance from H II regions using the direct method. The H II region-based
Cepheid metallicities used by Riess et al. in their determination of the Hubble
constant H_0 are in substantial agreement with our measurements. The direct
method gas-phase metallicities of the 18 star-forming galaxies we have analyzed
so far, when adjusted upward for a mean ~0.15 dex oxygen dust depletion factor,
are in good agreement with those we infer from the supergiants, over a factor
of 50 in metallicity. From the same data, we derive an expression for the
metal-dependent depletion of oxygen in photoionized nebulae. Utilizing the
flux-weighted gravity - luminosity relationship (FGLR) of blue supergiants, we
measure a distance to M101, D=6.5 +\- 0.2 Mpc (m-M = 29.06 +\- 0.08), which is
within 1 sigma from determinations based on the tip of the red giant branch and
Cepheids. With M101 as a nearby SN Ia host and using the observed standardized
B-band magnitude of the supernova, our FGLR distance yields an independent
value H_0 = 72.5 +\- 4.6 km/s/Mpc.

Abstract: We present a study of quasar host galaxy 3C 297 which is home to a powerful
bent-jet radio source suggesting vigorous interaction with a dense ISM and/or
jet precession. Archival HST imaging showed interestingly perturbed morphology
of the host with a bright ~30 kpc arc feature, extended filamentary structure
of line-emitting gas and clumpy blue excess emission co-spatial with the radio
hotspots. Our VLT/SINFONI integral-field observations reveal complex,
spatially-resolved H{\alpha}+[NII] emission in this source. A prominent
blue-shifted wing in H{\alpha} indicates an ionized gas flow extending out to
~18 kpc from the nuclear region. Combining our SINFONI narrow-H{\alpha} data
with archival HST/UV and VLA imaging, we map the young stellar population in
the host and compare the spatial distribution of star-forming regions with the
ionized gas motion and jet structure. In the attempt to characterize the
feedback mechanisms in this chaotic system, we suggest that the powerful radio
source dominates the feedback with possible contribution from radiation
pressure due to AGN accretion. We also propose that the expanding jet cocoon
likely shocked the ISM, triggering a kpc-scale ionized gas outflow and new
starbursts that enhanced ongoing merger-induced star formation.

Abstract: When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between
the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six
measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a
given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between
orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their
statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a
Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian
algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected
relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four
sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the
general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely
because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is
usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is
applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are
available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where
$G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting
Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm
N}>10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.063_{-0.047}^{+0.058}$ or
$0.134_{-0.040}^{+0.050}$ for $7\text{ or }8$ binaries with $g_{\rm
N}<10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$ (depending on one system) showing tension with Newton.
The Newtonian ``outlier'' is at the boundary set by the Newtonian escape
velocity, but can be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study
demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low
acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.

Abstract: Extreme nitrogen enhancement relative to oxygen, recently found in very
high-redshift galaxies, has been seen in local star-forming galaxies displaying
high log(N/O) values ($\geq\!-1.1$) at relatively low O abundances,
12+log(O/H)$\leq$8. Understanding the physical origins of these extreme
N-emitters at low redshifts enables us to better constrain chemical enrichment
mechanisms that drove such high log(N/O) values in the early Universe. With
direct N and O abundances derived for 944 SFGs with spectroscopic observational
data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 1 (DESI DR1),
we report the discovery of 19 extreme N-emitters at low-z (z$<$0.5). Our sample
of N-emitters represents a five-fold increase in their known number at low-z
with 12+log(O/H)$\leq$8, and statistically, $2.21\pm0.91$\% of DESI DR1 SFGs
with reliable O and N abundances obtained directly, are extreme N-emitters. The
sample spans a mass range of $\sim 10^7$ - $10^{10}$~M$_{\odot}$ with
12+log(O/H) range of $\sim$7.1 - 8.2, and the N-emitter fraction is found to
increase with increasing stellar mass and decreasing metallicity. The most
extreme N-emitter in our sample has log(N/O)=$-0.53\pm0.13$, while also having
the lowest 12+log(O/H)=$7.08\pm0.09$ and the highest stellar mass,
log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$)=$9.95\pm0.13$ among our sample. With galactic chemical
evolution models, we show that sustained N-enhancement by asymptotic giant
branch stars, in conjunction with presence of outflows, can well explain the
high log(N/O) of low-z extreme N-emitters. While single starbursts with outflow
are sufficient to explain lower-mass N-emitters, more massive ones require a
dual starburst scenario where a secondary starburst is triggered by inflow of
gas.

Abstract: A damped random walk (DRW) process is often used to describe the temporal
UV/optical continuum variability of active galactic nuclei (AGN). However,
recent investigations have shown that this model fails to capture the full
spectrum of AGN variability. In this work, we model the 22-year-long light
curves of $21,767$ quasars, spanning the redshift range $0.28 < z < 2.71$, as a
noise-driven damped harmonic oscillator (DHO) process. The light curves, in the
optical $g$ and $r$ bands, are collected and combined from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey, the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System, and the
Zwicky Transient Facility. A DHO process can be defined using four parameters,
two for describing its long-term behavior/variability, and the other two for
describing its short-term behavior/variability. We find that the best-fit DHO
model describes the observed variability of our quasar light curves better than
the best-fit DRW model. Furthermore, the best-fit DHO parameters exhibit
correlations with the rest-frame wavelength, the Eddington ratio, and the black
hole mass of our quasars. Based on the power spectral density shape of the
best-fit DHOs and these correlations, we suggest that the observed long-term
variability of our quasars can be best explained by accretion rate or thermal
fluctuations originating from the accretion disk, and the observed short-term
variability can be best explained by reprocessing of X-ray variability
originating from the corona. The additional information revealed by DHO
modeling emphasizes the need to go beyond DRW when analyzing AGN light curves
delivered by next-generation wide-field time-domain surveys.

Abstract: Comparing the dynamical and stellar masses of Milky Way (MW) globular
clusters (GCs) reveals a discrepancy exceeding a factor of two. Since this
substantial invisible mass is concentrated in the cluster centre, it is
attributed to stellar remnants. The majority of mass in remnants consists of
white dwarfs (WDs). Allocating over half of a GC's current mass to WDs could
significantly restrict the dynamical evolution scenarios governing stellar
clusters. As the most massive stars in GCs, black holes (BHs) exert a
substantial effect on the escape rate of lower mass stars, such as WDs. This
paper aims to identify which scenarios of BH natal kicks can accurately
reproduce the notable dark remnant fraction observed in MW GCs. We compare the
observed remnant fraction of MW GCs with a comprehensive grid of direct \Nbody
simulations while adjusting the natal kick received by BHs. Our results reveal
that simulations employing low natal kicks to BHs are the only ones capable of
mirroring the remnant fraction of MW GCs. According to the Spitzer instability,
the presence of a BH population prompts the formation of a BH sub-system
(BHSub) at the centre of a star cluster. The BHSub serves as an energetic power
plant, continually releasing kinetic energy through few-body encounters between
single and binary BHs, and transferring the generated energy to the entire
stellar population. This energy induces a significant difference in the
ejection rate of stellar remnants and luminous stars, ultimately increasing the
fraction of dark remnants within the star cluster.

Abstract: LDN 1616 is a cometary globule located approximately 8 degrees west of the
Orion OB1 associations. The massive OB stars in the Orion belt region act as
catalysts, triggering the star formation activity observed in the L1616 region,
which is a photodissociation region (PDR). This paper provides an in-depth
analysis of gas kinematics within the L1616 PDR, leveraging the Heterodyne
Array Receiver Program (HARP) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) to
observe 13CO and C18O (3-2) emissions. Employing the Clumpfind algorithm on the
C18O emission data, we identify three distinct clumps within this PDR. For each
of these clumps, we derive key physical parameters, including the mean kinetic
temperature, optical depth, and velocity dispersion. In addition, we compute
the non-thermal velocity dispersion and Mach number, providing critical
insights into the turbulent dynamics of the gas. A comprehensive evaluation of
mass, including virial and energy budget evaluations, is conducted to assess
the gravitational stability and star-forming potential of the identified
clumps. While previous studies have proposed that radiation-driven implosion
(RDI) is the dominant mechanism initiating star formation in LDN 1616, our
results suggest that the clumps may represent pre-existing substructures within
the PDR. This interpretation is supported by our estimation of a relatively low
interstellar radiation field, which, although insufficient to form clumps
independently, may enhance gravitational instability through additional
compression. Thus, our findings offer a more nuanced perspective on the role of
RDI, highlighting its capacity to trigger star formation by amplifying the
instability of pre-existing clumpy structures in PDRs like LDN 1616.

Abstract: The stochastic self-propagating star-formation (SSPSF) model is an important
theoretical framework for explaining how localised star-formation events
trigger subsequent activity across galactic discs. While widely used to
interpret spiral and irregular structures, its probabilistic rules have lacked
a formal statistical foundation. In this work, we establish a connection
between the SSPSF model and spatio-temporal point processes (STPP), which
describe events in space and time through history-dependent intensities. We
show that the SSPSF update law is equivalent to a separable spatio-temporal
Hawkes process, and we derive a simple likelihood function that recovers SSPSF
parameters from historical star-formation event data under simplifying
assumptions. Beyond the statistical formulation, the framework provides a new
approach to analysing the propagation of star formation in galaxies, enabling
observational surveys of star-forming regions to be interpreted within the STPP
framework. Furthermore, the approach naturally extends to continuous-time
models, offering a more realistic representation of galactic dynamics.

products include the reduced spectra, redshift catalog, emission-line catalogs
produced with \texttt{GELATO} for emission-line galaxies and \texttt{pPXF} fits
for quiescent systems, and ancillary spectral energy distribution (SED) fit
results derived from multi-band photometry. The SMILES NIRSpec dataset enables

Abstract: Infrared spectra of hydrocarbon dust absorption bands toward the bright
hypergiant Cygnus OB2-12 are compared to published spectra of the Quintuplet
Cluster, a sightline to the Galactic center. The Cyg OB2-12 data include a new
ground-based 2.86-3.70 microns spectrum and a previously published, but here
further analyzed, spectrum of the 5.50-7.34 microns region. Higher spectral
resolution data for the Cyg OB2-12 sightline in the 3 micron region allows a
detailed comparison of the 3.4 micron aliphatic bands to those observed toward
the Quintuplet. Despite differences in interstellar environments along each
sightline, strong similarities are observed in the central wavelengths and
relative strengths for bands at 3.3, 3.4, 5.85, 6.2, and 6.85 microns. Analysis
of these bands, produced by aromatic, aliphatic, olefinic, hydrogenated, and
oxygenated components, shows that carbonaceous dust is a significant component
of the diffuse interstellar medium, second in abundance only to silicates, and
is primarily aromatic in nature. The grains producing these bands likely
consist of large aromatic carbon cores with thin aliphatic mantles composed of
hydrogenated amorphous carbon (HAC). Laboratory analog spectra reproduce the
observed aliphatic absorption bands well, supporting the presence of such
mantles. We present evidence that the carriers of both the 3.4 micron aliphatic
and the 3.3 micron aromatic bands reside exclusively in the diffuse ISM, and
that the 3.3 micron bands observed in the diffuse ISM differ from those seen in
dense clouds, implying chemically distinct carriers.

Abstract: We present ALMA Total Power CO(1-0) mapping of Stephan's Quintet (SQ), a
prototypical compact galaxy group, with a uniform noise level at a spatial
scale of ~25 kpc. These observations provide the first complete view of
molecular gas across the whole system. Molecular gas is found to spread over a
wide area (~120 x 80 kpc), mainly over the two main member galaxies (NGC7318B
and 7319), but also in the shocked ridges between these galaxies, the tidal
tail, and also in intergalactic regions north of the tail. The total CO(1-0)
luminosity is $(2.47\pm0.12)\times10^9~\mathrm{K~km~s^{-1}~pc^2}$,
corresponding to a molecular gas mass of $(1.07\pm0.05)\times10^{10}~M_\odot$
assuming the Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor. The global star formation
efficiency of SQ is estimated at 0.29-0.70 $\mathrm{Gyr^{-1}}$, comparable to
or lower than that of nearby star-forming galaxies. Molecular gas spans a
velocity range of ~1300 km/s, which can be divided into three components (low,
mid, high). The low- and mid-velocity components, linked to NGC7318B and the
ridge, show relatively active star formation, whereas the high-velocity
component, associated with NGC7319, shows suppressed star formation. Our
mapping reveals molecular gas extending ~100 kpc in projection along the inner
tail and north of it, containing $(1.64\pm0.08)\times10^9~M_\odot$ (15% of
total) with low velocity dispersion (~20 km/s) and ongoing star formation.
While previous studies suggested in situ molecular gas formation in the tail,
our data suggest an additional contribution from gas stripped from NGC7319.

Abstract: Two main models coexist for the environment in which stars form. The
clustered model stipulates that the bulk of star formation occurs within dense
embedded clusters, but only a minority of them survive the residual gas
expulsion phase caused by massive stellar feedback unbinding the clusters. On
the other hand, the hierarchical model predicts that star formation happens at
a range of scales and densities, where open clusters (OCs) only emerge from the
densest regions. We aim to exploit a recent catalog of compact OCs, corrected
for completeness, to obtain an updated estimation of the surface density star
formation rate within OCs ($\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$), which we compare with recent
estimates of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ to determine which model is more likely. We have
applied two methods. The first one consisted of integrating over the power law
that was fit for the mass function of the youngest OCs using a MC sampling. The
second one consisted of counting the total compact mass within these youngest
OCs within 1 kpc, so that the result could be directly compared with local
values of $\sum_{\rm SFR}$. We estimated new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values between
$736^{+159}_{-176}$ and $875^{+34}_{-35}$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$,
depending on the methodology. These results are significantly higher than
previous $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ estimates, which we attribute to the
incompleteness of past catalogs, and are consistent with the majority ($\geq$
50 \%) or even the vast majority ($\geq$ 80 \%) of the star formation occurring
in initially compact clusters, through comparisons with $\sum_{\rm SFR}$ from
the recent literature. Our new $\sum_{\rm SFR,OC}$ values are consistent with
clustered formation being the most dominant mode of star formation.

Abstract: The Unification Model of AGN suggests that all AGN galaxies should exhibit
similar line ratios in their spectra. NGC 5548, a Seyfert I, underwent
obscuration -- similar to naturally obscured Seyfert II galaxies -- due to an
outflowing accretion wind, resulting in absorption. As per the Model, a Seyfert
I and a Seyfert II should show similar flux ratios during their respective
obscuration states. In this note, we present a comparison of emission fluxes
between NGC 5548 and NGC 1068, a Seyfert II. We present the CLOUDY prediction
of NGC 5548, which underpredicts the line ratios compared to observations,
likely due to SED choices. The differing observed line ratios of NGC 5548 and
NGC 1068 suggest additional unknown factors in the unification model.

Abstract: The serendipitous discovery of the M31 globular cluster (GC) EXT8 has
presented a significant challenge to current theories for GC formation. By
finding other GCs similar to EXT8, it should become clear if and/or how EXT8
can fit into our current understanding of GC formation. We aim to test the
potential of integrated-light narrow-band Ca II H & K photometry as a proxy for
the metallicity of GCs to be able to provide effective candidate selection for
massive GCs below the GC metallicity floor ([Fe/H] $\leq$ -2.5), such as EXT8.
We investigate the behaviour of two colours involving the CaHK filter employed
by the Pristine survey, CaHK-u and CaHK-g, as a function of metallicity through
CFHT MegaCam imaging of EXT8 and a wide set of M31 GCs covering the metallicity
range of -2.9 $\leq$ [Fe/H] $\leq$ +0.4. Additionally, we investigate if the
CaHK colours are strongly influenced by horizontal branch morphology through
available morphology measurements. In both of the CaHK colours, EXT8 and two
other potential GCs below the metallicity floor can be selected from other
metal-poor GCs ([Fe/H] $\leq$ -1.5) with CaHK-g showing the larger metallicity
sensitivity. The RMS of linear fits to the metal-poor GCs show an uncertainty
of 0.3 dex on metallicity estimations for both colours. Comparisons with u-g
and g-z/F450W-F850L colours reinforce the notion that CaHK photometry can be
used for effective candidate selection as they reduce false positive selection
rates by at least a factor of 2. We find no strong influence of the horizontal
branch morphology on the CaHK colours that would interfere with candidate
selection, although the assessment is limited by quantity and quality of
available data.

Abstract: Understanding the cold atomic hydrogen gas (HI) within cosmic filaments has
the potential to pin down the relationship between the low density gas in the
cosmic web and how the galaxies that lie within it grow using this material. We
report the discovery of a cosmic filament using 14 HI-selected galaxies that
form a very thin elongated structure of 1.7 Mpc. These galaxies are embedded
within a much larger cosmic web filament, traced by optical galaxies, that
spans at least $\sim 15$~Mpc. We find that the spin axes of the HI galaxies are
significantly more strongly aligned with the cosmic web filament
($\langle\lvert \cos \psi \rvert\rangle = 0.64 \pm 0.05$) than cosmological
simulations predict, with the optically-selected galaxies showing alignment to
a lesser degree ($\langle\lvert \cos \psi \rvert\rangle = 0.55 \pm 0.05$). This
structure demonstrates that within the cosmic filament, the angular momentum of
galaxies is closely connected to the large-scale filamentary structure. We also
find strong evidence that the galaxies are orbiting around the spine of the
filament, making this one of the largest rotating structures discovered thus
far, and from which we can infer that there is transfer of angular momentum
from the filament to the individual galaxies. The abundance of HI galaxies
along the filament and the low dynamical temperature of the galaxies within the
filament indicates that this filament is at an early evolutionary stage where
the imprint of cosmic matter flow on galaxies has been preserved over cosmic
time.

Abstract: Simulations predict that circumgalactic hydrogen gas surrounding massive
($M_{\rm{halo}}^{z=1}=10^{12}-10^{13}\ M_{\odot}$) galaxies at $z\sim4$ may be
predominantly neutral, and could produce damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs)
along sight-lines to background quasars \citep{Stern2021}. A circumgalactic
medium (CGM) origin for DLAs naturally explains high redshift HI
absorption-selected galaxy detections at physical separations much greater than
the likely extents of the galaxy disks \citep{Neeleman2017, Neeleman2019}. The
observed $z\sim 4$ DLA HI column densities are large and comparable to
interstellar (ISM) gas columns at which substantial molecular hydrogen (H$_2$)
abundances occur. We therefore investigate the possible molecular content of
high-redshift CGM gas, and its potential detectability via (rest-frame)
far-ultraviolet (UV) absorption line studies. For this purpose we develop an
analytic sub-grid model for HI-to-H$_2$ transitions and incorporate the model
with zoom-in FIRE-2 simulations of evolving high-$z$ galaxies. We include dust
absorption and scattering computations for the transfer of photodissociating
Lyman-Werner (LW) band radiation. We find that the typical extents of
detectable H$_2$ sightlines are $\approx 0.1\, R_{\rm vir}$, independent of
redshift from $z=2.5$ to 5. We argue that a CGM origin for DLAs naturally
explains the low detection rates of H$_2$ in DLA observations, as the low CGM
densities and relatively strong far-UV fields lead to molecular fractions much
lower than observed in the ISM at comparable HI columns.

Abstract: Star formation governs galaxy evolution, shaping stellar mass assembly and
gas consumption across cosmic time. The Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation,
linking star formation rate (SFR) and gas surface densities, is fundamental to
understand star formation regulation, yet remains poorly constrained at $z > 2$
due to observational limitations and uncertainties in locally calibrated gas
tracers. The [CII] $158 {\rm \mu m}$ line has recently emerged as a key probe
of the cold ISM and star formation in the early Universe. We investigate
whether the resolved [CII]-SFR and KS relations established at low redshift
remain valid at $4 < z < 6$ by analysing 13 main-sequence galaxies from the
ALPINE and CRISTAL surveys, using multi-wavelength data (HST, JWST, ALMA) at
$\sim2$ kpc resolution. We perform pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution
(SED) modelling with CIGALE on resolution-homogenised images. We develop a
statistical framework to fit the [CII]-SFR relation that accounts for pixel
covariance and compare our results to classical fitting methods. We test two
[CII]-to-gas conversion prescriptions to assess their impact on inferred gas
surface densities and depletion times. We find a resolved [CII]-SFR relation
with a slope of $0.87 \pm 0.15$ and intrinsic scatter of $0.19 \pm 0.03$ dex,
which is shallower and tighter than previous studies at $z\sim5$. The resolved
KS relation is highly sensitive to the [CII]-to-gas conversion factor: using a
fixed global $\alpha_{\rm [CII]}$ yields depletion times of $0.5$-$1$ Gyr,
while a surface brightness-dependent $W_{\rm [CII]}$, places some galaxies with
high gas density in the starburst regime ($<0.1$ Gyr). Future inputs from both
simulations and observations are required to better understand how the
[CII]-to-gas conversion factor depends on local ISM properties. We need to
break this fundamental limit to properly study the KS relation at $z\gtrsim4$.

Abstract: Based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), we present a novel emulator of
the global 21 cm cosmology signal, $\texttt{21cmKAN}$, that provides extremely
fast training speed while achieving nearly equivalent accuracy to the most
accurate emulator to date, $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$. The combination of enhanced
speed and accuracy facilitated by $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ enables rapid and highly
accurate physical parameter estimation analyses of multiple 21 cm models, which
is needed to fully characterize the complex feature space across models and
produce robust constraints on the early universe. Rather than using static
functions to model complex relationships like traditional fully-connected
neural networks do, KANs learn expressive transformations that can perform
significantly better for low-dimensional physical problems. $\texttt{21cmKAN}$
predicts a given signal for two well-known models in the community in 3.7 ms on
average and trains about 75 times faster than $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$, when
utilizing the same typical GPU. $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ is able to achieve these
speeds because of its learnable, data-driven transformations and its relatively
small number of trainable parameters compared to a memory-based emulator. We
show that $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ required less than 30 minutes to train and fit
these simulated signals and obtain unbiased posterior distributions. We find
that the transparent architecture of $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ allows us to
conveniently interpret and further validate its emulation results in terms of
the sensitivity of the 21 cm signal to each physical parameter. This work
demonstrates the effectiveness of KANs and their ability to more quickly and
accurately mimic expensive physical simulations in comparison to other types of
neural networks.

Abstract: Constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity (LPnG) obtained from galaxy
power spectra are limited by the perfect degeneracy between the LPnG parameter
$f_{\rm NL}$ and the bias parameter $b_{\phi}$ which encodes the response of
galaxy clustering to a change in the amplitude of primordial curvature
fluctuations. For galaxies observed by galaxy surveys, the relation between
$b_{\phi}$ and the galaxy bias $b_{g}$ is poorly understood and differs
significantly from the universal mass function ansatz. In this paper, we
investigate this non-universality in the context of dark-matter halos using the
Separate Universe framework, focussing on dark-matter halos selected by mass
and/or concentration. We show that the Separate Universe framework provides a
natural explanation of the observed universality in the bias of dark-matter
halos selected purely by their mass, independent of the spherical collapse
picture of halo formation. We further propose an explanation for the observed
non-universality in halos selected by concentration and corroborate it with
$N$-body simulations in scale-free (EdS) and $\Lambda\text{CDM}$ cosmologies.
In particular, we show that the relation between $b_{\phi}$ and halo bias
$b_{h}$ for halos selected by concentration in matter-dominated cosmologies
tends towards universality at the highest halo masses due to such halos
gravitationally dominating their environment throughout their evolution. We
also argue that concentration-selected halos of lower masses exhibit
non-universality due to their mass accretion being significantly affected by
the gravitational influence of neighbouring, more massive halos. Our results
suggest that any non-universality in high redshift ($z\gtrsim 3$), high-bias
objects observed by realistic galaxy surveys is entirely an artifact of the
associated selection function.

Abstract: We perform a frequentist analysis using the standard profile likelihood
method for clustering measurements from Data Release 1 of the Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). While Bayesian inferences for Effective Field
Theory models of galaxy clustering can be highly sensitive to the choice of
priors for extended cosmological models, frequentist inferences are not
susceptible to such effects. We compare Bayesian and frequentist constraints
for the parameter set $\{\sigma_8, H_0, \Omega_{\rm{m}}, w_0, w_a\}$ when
fitting to the full-shape of the power spectrum multipoles, the
post-reconstruction Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, as well as
external datasets from the CMB and type Ia supernovae measurements. Bayesian
prior effects are very significant for the $w_0w_a$CDM model; while the $1
\sigma$ frequentist confidence intervals encompass the maximum a posteriori
(MAP), the Bayesian credible intervals almost always exclude the maximum
likelihood estimate (MLE) and the MAP - indicating strong prior volume
projection effects - unless supernovae data are included. We observe limited
prior effects for the $\Lambda$CDM model, due to the reduced number of
parameters. When DESI full-shape and BAO data are jointly fit, we obtain the
following $1\sigma$ frequentist confidence intervals for $\Lambda$CDM
($w_0w_a$CDM): $\sigma_8 = 0.867^{+0.048}_{-0.041} , \ H_0 =
68.91^{+0.80}_{-0.79} \ \rm{km \ s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}} , \ \Omega_{\rm{m}} =

Abstract: Observations of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) B-mode polarization provide
a way to probe primordial gravitational waves and test inflationary
predictions. Extragalactic point sources become a major source of contamination
after delensing and can bias estimates of the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ at the
$10^{-3}$ level. We introduce Generalized Point Spread Function Fitting (GPSF),
a method for removing point-source contamination in polarization maps. GPSF
uses the full pixel-domain covariance, including off-diagonal terms, and models
overlapping sources. This allows accurate flux estimation under realistic
conditions, particularly for small-aperture telescopes with large beams that
are more susceptible to source blending. We test GPSF on simulated sky maps,
apply foreground cleaning using the Needlet Internal Linear Combination (NILC)
method, and compare its performance with standard masking and inpainting. The
results show GPSF reduces point-source contamination without significantly
affecting the background signal, as seen in both the maps and their power
spectra. For the constraint on $r$, GPSF reduces the bias from $1.67 \times
10^{-3}$ to $2.9 \times 10^{-4}$, with only a 2% increase in standard
deviation. Compared to inpainting and masking, GPSF yields lower bias while
maintaining comparable variance. This suggests that it may serve as a promising
method for future CMB experiments targeting measurements of $r \sim 10^{-3}$.

Abstract: We present a framework that combines physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference to constrain dynamical dark
energy models using the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova compilation. First, we
train a physics-informed neural network to learn the solution of the Friedmann
equation and accurately reproduce the matter density term x_m(z) = Omega_m,0
(1+z)^3 across a range of Omega_m,0. For each of five two-parameter
equation-of-state (EoS) forms: Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL),
Barboza-Alcaniz (BA), Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP), Linear-z, and
Logarithmic-z, we derive the analytic dark energy factor x_de(z), embed the
trained surrogate within a GPU-accelerated likelihood pipeline, and sample the
posterior of (h0, Omega_m,0, w0, wa, M0) using the emcee ensemble sampler with
the full Pantheon+ covariance. All parameterizations remain consistent with a
cosmological constant (w0 = -1, wa = 0) at the 95% credible level, with the
tightest bounds from the CPL form. While the surrogate does not reduce
computation time for a single run in simple models, it becomes advantageous for
repeated analyses of the same EoS or for models with expensive likelihood
evaluations, and can be shared as a reusable tool with different datasets
within the training range of SNe redshifts. This flexibility makes the approach
a scalable tool for future cosmological inference, especially in regimes where
conventional ODE-based methods are computationally prohibitive.

Abstract: We report a numerical discovery that the formations of cosmic voids are
closely linked with the mechanism through which the giant galaxies on void
surfaces establish elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower sSFR.
Identifying the voids from the TNG300-1 simulations via the Void-Finder
algorithm, we explore if and how the shapes of the TNG galaxies located on void
surfaces are aligned with the directions toward the void centers. Noting that
only the giant void-surface galaxies with stellar masses $M_{\star}\ge
10^{10.5}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$ exhibit significant tendency of perpendicular
alignments, we dichotomize them into two $M_{\star}$-controlled samples
according to their morphologies (elliptical or spiral), colors (redder or
bluer), sSFR (lower or higher) and stellar ages (older or younger). It is found
that the void-galaxy perpendicular alignment becomes stronger for the cases
that the void-surface galaxies have elliptical shapes, redder colors, and lower
sSFR. The numerical results are also shown to be well described by the
analytical one-parameter model derived under the assumption of the existence of
a linear scaling between the covariance matrices of galaxy shape axes and local
tidal tensors. Our result implies that the compression of adjacent matter due
to the formation and rapid expansion of cosmic voids prevent them from radial
infall/accretion, which in turn contribute to stalling and quenching the giant
void-surface galaxies. Given that the formation epochs and expansion rates of
cosmic voids depend sensitively on the dark energy equation of state, we also
discuss a possibility of using the abundance of elliptical void-surface
galaxies as a probe of dark energy.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of dark matter halo masses for galaxy groups is central
to studies of galaxy evolution and for leveraging group catalogues as
cosmological probes. We present a calibration and evaluation of two
complementary halo mass estimators: a dynamical estimator based on the virial
theorem, and an empirical relation between the sum of the stellar masses of the
three most massive group galaxies and the halo mass (SHMR). Using
state-of-the-art semi-analytic models (SHARK, SAGE, and GAEA) to generate mock
light-cone catalogues, we quantify the accuracy, uncertainty, and model
dependence of each method. The calibrated virial theorem achieves negligible
systematic bias (mean $\Delta$ = -0.01 dex) and low scatter (mean $\sigma$ =
0.20 dex) with no sensitivity to baryonic physics. The calibrated SHMR yields
the highest precision (mean $\Delta$ = 0.02 dex, mean $\sigma$ = 0.14 dex) but
shows greater model dependence due to sensitivity to baryonic physics across
the models. We demonstrate applications to observational catalogues, including
the empirical halo mass function and mapping quenched fractions in the stellar
mass-halo mass plane. We provide guidance: the virial theorem is recommended
for GAMA-like surveys (i < 19.2) at z < 0.1 where minimal model dependence is
required, while the SHMR is optimal for high-precision halo mass estimates
across diverse catalogues with limits of z < 0.3. These calibrated estimators
will aid upcoming wide-area spectroscopic surveys in probing the connection
between galaxies and their host dark matter halos.

Abstract: Next-generation gamma-ray observatories aim to enable precision measurements
in high-energy astrophysics using advanced semiconductor detector technologies.
Meeting the scientific requirements of modern instruments demands detector
systems that provide high spatial and spectral resolution across large
detection areas, with strict limits on power consumption and mass. These needs
drive innovation in front-end electronics and mixed-signal processing to
support compact detector electrode geometries. Application-specific integrated
circuits (ASICs) are essential in front-end readout electronics, enabling
high-channel-density and low-power systems, while maintaining low-noise
performance suitable for space-based instruments and balloon-borne payloads.
The NRL4 (Naval Research Laboratory 4) is a recently developed 32-channel
front-end ASIC featuring low-power, low-noise channels consisting of
charge-sensitive preamplifiers, 4 configurable gain settings, dual configurable
shapers for optimized timing and energy resolution, trimmable per-channel
discrimination, time-to-analog conversion, and peak-detect output. The NRL4 has
been integrated with a high-purity germanium (HPGe) dual-sided strip detector
with a 1.16 mm strip pitch. Energy resolution of 3 keV full width at half
maximum (FWHM) at 59.54 keV was achieved with a gain of 18.4 mV/fC and a slow
shaper peaking time of 2 {\mu}s. Preliminary results from ongoing research
demonstrate the suitability of the NRL4 for high-resolution, low-power

Abstract: Recent work has successfully achieved sub-arcsecond wide-field imaging with
high-band observations from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). However, the
scalability of this work remains limited due to the need for manual
intervention, poor calibration solutions for the Dutch LOFAR stations, and high
computational costs. We address these issues by: (1) improving automated
self-calibration using a signal-to-noise metric and a neural network for image
artefact detection; (2) implementing a refined calibration strategy for the
Dutch LOFAR stations; and (3) cutting computational costs by optimising the
data processing strategy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our automated
processing strategy by reprocessing one previously reduced dataset and a new
dataset from the ELAIS-N1 deep field, which features more severe ionospheric
conditions. We find calibration artefacts across facet boundaries to be reduced
with our improved automated calibration strategy and achieve a computational
cost reduction of about a factor of 4 to 6 compared to previous work, where the
exact factor depends on whether a single observation is processed or multiple
observations of the same sky area are combined. Further optimisation and
improved handling of data with baseline-dependent averaging could reduce this
in the near future by another factor of two, bringing the total cost for an
8-hour observation below 30,000 CPU core hours. This work enables ultra-deep
imaging at sensitivities on the order of a few $\mu$Jy/beam. Furthermore, it
also lays the foundation for a fully automated survey pipeline for
sub-arcsecond wide-field imaging of the northern sky with LOFAR.

fidelity that is achieved in practise. An under-utilised degree of freedom
during Fourier imaging is the relative weights that are assigned to the
visibility data. We explore the circumstances under which some adjustment of
the relative weights might provide improvements to the "dirty" image, and
consequently the ultimate post-deconvolution image fidelity. We develop a
method to calculate a distinct effective local density estimate for each data
point. When used in conjunction with a "uniform" weight correction and the
desired clean beam (eg. Gaussian) tapering, it provides a significant
improvement in the image quality over that provided by the current pixel-based
density estimate. In many cases, particularly spectral-line observations and
those with only limited sidereal tracking, this adaptive approach improves the
beam quality by a factor of 2 to 10, as measured by the RMS residual relative
to the best-fitting clean beam, providing an improvement in final image
fidelity that is similar in magnitude.

Abstract: Power spectral density (PSD) estimation is a critical step in gravitational
wave (GW) detectors data analysis. The Welch method is a typical non-parametric
spectral estimation approach that estimates the PSD of stationary noise by
averaging periodograms of several time segments, or by taking the median of
periodograms to adapt to non-stationary noise. In this work, we propose a
wavelet-based approach for fast PSD estimation of both stationary and
non-stationary noise. For stationary noise, we apply wavelet smoothing to the
periodogram, avoiding the segmentation step in the Welch method, and enabling
PSD estimates with high frequency resolution and low variance. The wavelet
smoothing PSD outperforms Welch PSD in matched filtering and parameter
estimation. For non-stationary noise, we estimate the PSD by taking the median
of wavelet packet coefficients in each frequency bin, which offers greater
robustness than the traditional median periodogram method. This work introduces
a new PSD estimation approach for GW data analysis and expands the application
of wavelet methods in this field.

Abstract: Testing General Relativity (GR) is a key science goal of much of modern
physics, and usually results in constraints that are either theory or context
specific. We present an holistic framework that we dub `Parametrized
Post-Newtonian Cosmology' (PPNC), which can be used for obtaining
theory-agnostic constraints on deviations from GR using a single unified set of
parameters that apply on all astrophysical and cosmological scales. Our
approach is based on the formalism and philosophy of the highly successful
Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) framework, but allows us to combine
observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic
Oscillations (BAOs) with Solar System observations of the Cassini probe and
ephemeris of Mars. The full combination of these data sets constrains average
deviations from GR over the history of the Universe to be less than $\sim
10\%$, with PPNC parameter values $\bar{\alpha}=0.97^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ and
$\bar{\gamma}=0.97^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ at the $68\%$ confidence level (GR
corresponds to $\bar{\alpha}=\bar{\gamma}=1$). We find that these gravitational
parameters have a strong mutual degeneracy, and are constrained to be within
$1\%$ of each other for all of cosmic history. Our results demonstrate the
ability of the PPNC framework to combine astrophysical, Solar System and
cosmological tests of gravity into a single set of unified constraints. We
expect our approach to be particularly useful for upcoming missions in both
cosmology and astrophysics, which ultimately seek to constrain the same
underlying gravitational interaction.

Abstract: We develop the spacetime approach to gravitational lensing by spherically
symmetric perturbations of flat, cosmological constant-dominated
Friedman-Robertson-Walker metrics. The geodesics of the spacetime are expressed
as integral expressions which are used to examine the formation of multiple
images and the observed shapes of non-point sources. We develop the lens
mapping from the spacetime perspective, and use the Jacobian of the mapping to
explain the observed image shapes. Approaching the geodesic equations as
ordinary differential equations, we demonstrate the development of wave front
singularities and time delays between light ray signals. This work demonstrates
that the widely used thin lens approximation can be replaced with more robust
techniques aligned with general relativity.

Abstract: We develop a model for supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) accreting
below their Eddington limit, focusing on systems where hot, advection-dominated
flows become viable. We specifically explore the spectral appearance of
multi-component accretion flows where the solution can independently transition
between cold, thin disks and hot, advection-dominated torii depending on the
local accretion rate. Using a three-disk model, we compute spectral energy
distributions for four possible accretion configurations and assess their
observational signatures, including which frequencies might reflect variability
at the binary orbital period. The spectral modeling reveals that binary
accretion can self-consistently account for many of the properties of standard
AGN, while the variability analysis shows that hydrodynamic modulation at the
binary period is most likely in the thermal emission and low-frequency
synchrotron components. Doppler boosting of emitting material bound to a single
binary component would also induce periodic variability. We apply our model to
the SMBHB candidate PG1302-102 and demonstrate that a mixed-component accretion
state (plus a jet feature) can self-consistently capture the observed broadband
spectrum. Our model offers a framework for interpreting candidate SMBHBs and
motivates future multi-wavelength follow-up of potential multi-messenger
sources, as well as more detailed future modeling of multi-component binary
accretion.

Abstract: The association between FRB 20200428D and the Galactic magnetar SGR
J1935+2154 makes magnetars the leading engine of cosmological fast radio bursts
(FRBs). However, there is a list of puzzles for this magnetar-for-all-FRBs
scenario: known Galactic magnetars are all isolated and none of them are active
repeaters; some cosmological repeaters have extremely high repetition rates but
without any measurable spin-related periodicity; some show long-term periodic
active windows; and some show diverse rotation measure (RM) evolution patterns,
such as quasi-periodic fluctuations, sign reversals, and abrupt RM flares. Here
we propose a unified theoretical framework for FRBs within the framework of
magnetar engine: Most active repeating FRBs originate from magnetars in binary
systems with nearly aligned rotation and magnetic axes, some of which with a
triple-aligned geometry, i.e. with an alignment with the orbital axis as well;
whereas apparent non-repeaters and inactive repeaters originate from magnetars
in isolated systems or in binaries with a misaligned geometry. By studying
various magnetar formation channels using population syntheses, we show that a
few percent of magnetars in the universe can be in binary systems, most with a
massive star companion and some with aligned geometry. We suggest that such
binary systems can account for the rich phenomenology of active repeaters. We
suggest that the existence of a companion helps to maintain the aligned
geometry and that the companion may play an active role in triggering FRBs in
an active repeater source.

Abstract: Some planetary nebulae (PNe) host X-ray-emitting hot bubbles shaped by
stellar wind interactions and/or harbor X-ray-emitting central stars due to
accretion, shocks within their fast stellar winds, or even chromospheric
emission from binary companions. In both cases, the properties of the X-ray
emission critically probe late-stages of stellar evolution for such low- and
intermediate-mass stars. While extant Chandra and XMM-Newton observations have
detected X-ray emission in PNe, the numbers known remain very small ($\sim40$)
compared to the overall Galactic PNe population ($\sim4000$). We have initiated
a project aimed at increasing the sample of known PNe with X-ray emission using
both current and new space-based X-ray telescopes such as the Einstein probe.
To further investigate their X-ray properties to elucidate what drives current
X-ray PN detections, we have cross-searched the SRG {\it eROSITA-DE} eRASS1
source catalogue and Hong Kong (HASH) PNe Database. Five known X-ray PNe have
been detected (Abell\,30, NGC\,2392, NGC\,3242, NGC\,5315, and LoTr\,5), two
new X-ray PNe are revealed (IC\,1297 and NGC\,2867), one (K\,1-27) is removed
from previous X-ray compilations, and another 11 previously detected X-ray
emitting PNe are not recovered. A comparison of the X-ray flux of detected and
undetected X-ray PNe reveals that eROSITA eRASS1 is sensitive to PNe with X-ray
fluxes larger than $\approx2\times10^{-14}$ erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$. The
frequency of occurrence is $\simeq$0.5\% among the 1430 HASH True PNe in the

Abstract: Light curve analysis of W UMa-type contact binary systems using MCMC or MC
methods can be time-consuming, primarily because the repeated generation of
synthetic light curves tends to be relatively slow during the fitting process.
Although various approaches have been proposed to address this issue, their
implementation is often challenging due to complexity or uncertain performance.
In this study, we introduce the BSN application, whose name is taken from the
BSN project. The application is designed for analyzing contact binary system
light curves, supporting photometric data, and employing an MCMC algorithm for
efficient parameter estimation. The BSN application generates synthetic light
curves more than 40 times faster than PHOEBE during the MCMC fitting process.
The BSN application enhances light curve analysis with an expanded feature set
and a more intuitive interface while maintaining compliance with established
scientific standards. In addition, we present the first light curve analyses of
four contact binary systems based on the TESS data, utilizing the BSN
application version 1.0. We also conducted a light curve analysis using the
PHOEBE Python code and compared the resulting outputs. Two of the target
systems exhibited asymmetries in the maxima of their light curves, which were
appropriately modeled by introducing a cold starspot on one of the components.
The estimated mass ratios of these total-eclipse systems place them within the
category of low mass ratio contact binary stars. The estimation of the absolute
parameters for the selected systems was carried out using the $P-a$ empirical
relationship. Based on the effective temperatures and masses of the components,
three of the target systems were classified as A-subtype, while TIC 434222993
was identified as a W-subtype system.

Abstract: Classifying variable stars is crucial for advancing our understanding of
stellar evolution and dynamics. As large-scale surveys generate increasing
volumes of light curve data, the demand for automated and reliable
classification techniques continues to grow. Traditional methods often rely on
manual feature extraction and selection, which can be labor-intensive and less
effective for managing extensive datasets. In this study, we present a
convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for classifying variable stars
using raw light curve data and their known periods. Our approach eliminates the
need for manual feature extraction and preselected preprocessing steps. By
applying phase-folding and interpolation to structure the light curves, the
model learns variability patterns critical for accurate classification. Trained
and evaluated on the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) dataset,
our model achieves an average accuracy of 90% and an F1 score of 0.86 across
six well-known classes of variable stars. The CNN effectively handles the
diverse shapes and sampling cadences of light curves, offering a robust,
automated, data-driven solution for classifying variable stars. This automated,
data-driven method provides a robust solution for classifying variable stars,
enabling the efficient analysis of large datasets from both current and future
sky surveys.

Abstract: Core-collapsed globular clusters are ideal targets to explore the presence of
stellar collision products. Here, we have studied seventeen FUV bright white
dwarf members in the globular cluster NGC 362 using data obtained from the
Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) mounted on AstroSat and from HST.
Multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are analyzed using UV and
optical data sets to characterize and determine the parameters of white dwarfs.
Fourteen of the white dwarfs fit single-component SEDs well, while three showed
a good fit with a two-component SED model,indicating a binary system comprising
a white dwarf and a low-mass main-sequence star. The effective temperature,
radius, luminosity, and mass of white dwarfs range between 22000 - 70000 K,
0.008 - 0.028 Rsun, 0.09 - 3.0 Lsun, and 0.30 - 1.13 Msun, respectively. The
effective temperature, radius, luminosity, and mass of the companions (low-mass
main-sequence stars) are 3500 - 3750 K, 0.150 - 0.234 Rsun,0.003 - 0.01 Lsun,
and 0.14 - 0.24 Msun, respectively. The three binary systems (WD-MS), along
with the massive WDs may have formed through dynamical processes that occurred
during the core collapse of the cluster. This is the first evidence of a
massive WD formation in a core-collapsed cluster, which is the missing link in
the formation of a fast radio burst (FRB) progenitor in a globular cluster.
This study provides evidence that NGC 362 hosts stellar systems that may evolve
into exotic stars such as Type Ia supernovae, and/or FRBs in the future. *This

Abstract: The high-mass (M$>$2 \Msolar{}) Kepler red giant stars are less well-studied
than their lower-mass counterparts. In the previous article, we presented a
sample of 48 high-mass Kepler red giants and measured their asteroseismic
parameters. This article presents spectroscopic measurements from the same
sample, using high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectra to determine \Teff{}, [Fe/H],
\logg{}, and $v \sin i$. We refined our previous estimates of the stellar
masses and radii based on the new \Teff{}. We also examined spectral features
that could indicate binary activity, such as the Li line and [C/N] ratios. We
found no Li-rich stars or clear [C/N] anomalies, but we observed a correlation
between [C/N] and [Fe/H]. We measured chromospheric activity using the
$S$-index of the Ca II H \& K lines and found no correlation with internal
magnetic fields. However, we confirmed an anti-correlation between surface
chromospheric activity and radial mode oscillation amplitudes, which indicates
that strong surface magnetic fields weaken stellar oscillations. Finally, we
used the Gaia DR3 astrometric data to show that our sample of stars have orbits
consistent with all three Galactic kinematic regions. Although these stars are
quite young, their orbits carry them into the thick disk and even the halo,
raising questions about the accuracy and viability of kinematics in unravelling
Galactic history. In future work, we plan to use the spectroscopic parameters
measured here to provide better constraints for boutique frequency modelling,
which will allow us to test the asteroseismic scaling relations at the
high-mass regime.

Abstract: After carbon and oxygen, $^{22}$Ne is the most abundant element in white
dwarf interiors. As C/O white dwarfs (WDs) crystallize, they are predicted to
go through a distillation process in the central layers if they have a
sufficiently high $^{22}$Ne mass fraction of $\gtrsim2.5$\%. Observational
evidence for distillation comes from an over-density of WDs on the Q-branch in
Gaia color-magnitude diagrams, which indicates that $\sim6$\% of massive WDs
are delayed in their cooling by as much as $\sim10$ Gyr. However, it is unclear
how these stars end up with such a high concentration of $^{22}$Ne and if a
significant fraction of the more common average-mass WDs go through
distillation. We argue that a significant metal-rich stellar population in the
solar neighborhood should lead to distilled WDs, without requiring a binary
merger. We use MESA along with the CNO abundances derived from high-resolution
spectroscopy of stars included in the Hypatia catalog to predict the $^{22}$Ne
mass fraction in their descendant WDs. We find that 0.6-2.5\% of the WDs in the
solar neighborhood have sufficient $^{22}$Ne in their interiors to go through
multi-Gyr cooling delays, which could significantly inflate their numbers in
the observed samples. Hence, $^{22}$Ne distillation and long-lived habitable
zones around WDs should be relatively common in the solar neighborhood. We also
use a Galactic model to predict the fraction of WDs that go through
distillation as a function of Galactocentric distance. The fraction of
distilled WDs is $\sim2$-8\% near the Galactic center, and declines steadily
toward the outer disk.

Abstract: Massive stars play a critical role in the evolution of galaxies, but their
formation remains poorly understood. One challenge is accurate measurement of
the physical properties of massive protostars, such as current stellar mass,
envelope mass, outflow cavity properties, and system orientation. Spectral
energy distribution (SED) fitting is widely-used to test models against
observations. The far-infrared SED traces cold dust in envelopes, while the
near- and mid-infrared (MIR) probes emission from outflow cavities and/or the
inner envelope. However, SED fitting has degeneracy limiting its ability to
yield accurate measurements of protostellar properties. Here, we develop image
profile (IMPRO) fitting as a method to improve the characterization of
protostars. We utilize brightness distributions from multi-wavelength MIR
images of massive protostars taken by SOFIA/FORCAST as part of the SOFIA
Massive Star Formation (SOMA) survey to constrain protostellar properties via
comparison to a grid of radiative transfer models. We develop a fitting
pipeline to extract information along the outflow axis, which is then combined
with the SED fitting to yield improved constraints on protostellar properties.
We apply the IMPRO fitting method on the nearby massive protostar Cepheus A,
finding that its properties become more tightly constrained compared to SED
fitting, especially in the inclination of the source. However, for the more
distant G35.20-0.74N, we find that the spatial resolution of SOFIA/FORCAST
limits the utility of this combined fitting pipeline. However, higher
resolution MIR observations, e.g., with JWST, are expected to greatly expand
the applicability of this fitting technique to protostars across the Galaxy.

Abstract: Both star clusters and variable stars are sensitive laboratories of stellar
astrophysics and evolution: cluster member stars provide context for
interpreting cluster populations, whereas variability reveals the nature of
individual stellar systems. The European Space Agency's Gaia mission has
revolutionized the census of star clusters in the Milky Way, while
simultaneously providing an unprecedented homogeneous all-sky catalog of
variable stars. Here, we leverage the third Gaia data release to obtain an
empirical bird's eye view of stellar evolution based on 34760 variable stars
residing in 1192 Galactic open clusters (OCs) containing 173294 members
(variable member fraction 20.0%). Using precise OC distances, dereddened
magnitudes, and consistently determined ages, we a) pinpointed regions of
pulsational instability across the color-absolute magnitude diagram (CaMD); b)
traced the occurrence rate of variables as a function of age, and c) considered
the evolution of rotation periods and photometric activity (gyrochronology).
The occurrence of pulsating stars can serve as a model- and
reddening-independent age estimator. Our results underline that jointly
considering stellar variability and OC membership enables a plethora of further
applications, such as age dating or dereddening OCs based on expected CaMD
locations of variable stars. Upcoming Gaia data releases and the Vera C. Rubin
Observatory will vastly increase the extent to which the details of variable
stars in OCs can empirically unravel the astrophysics and evolution of stellar
populations.

Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are among the primary sources of dust in
galaxies. In this study, we derive theoretical upper limits on dust masses as a
function of supernova (SN) progenitors with initial masses between 9 and 120
Msun, based on previously established models of dust formation chemistry in
CCSNe. We find that O-rich dust, particularly silicates, dominates the dust
budget, with masses ranging from 0.02 to 0.9 Msun, and that the total mass of
O-rich dust increases with progenitor mass. C-rich amorphous carbon dust is
significant for lower-mass progenitors (up to 15 Msun), but its mass never
exceeds 0.05 Msun. For progenitors up to 30 Msun, we provide best-fit functions
describing the masses of O-rich dust, C-rich dust, and CO molecules. A large
stochastic variation is found in the predicted masses of silicate dust, which
correlates with the randomness of shell-merger events in the pre-explosion
phases of massive stars. Furthermore, we show that the dust mass for a given
progenitor can vary by a factor of 2-5, reflecting differences in pre-explosion
abundance profiles predicted by the stellar evolution codes KEPLER and MESA. We
emphasize that the final dust yield in CCSNe is primarily determined by
stochastic stellar yields and uncertainties in pre-explosion nucleosynthesis,
while explosion properties mainly influence the timescales of dust formation.

Abstract: Doppler Imaging (DI) is a well-established technique to map a physical field
at a stellar surface from a time series of high-resolution spectra. In this
proof-of-concept study, we aim to show that traditional DI algorithms,
originally designed for rapidly-rotating stars, have also the ability to model
the activity of Sun-like stars, when observed with new-generation highly-stable
spectrographs, and search for low-mass planets around them. We used DI to
retrieve the relative brightness distribution at the surface of the Sun from
radial velocity (RV) observations collected by HARPS-N between 2022 and 2024.
The brightness maps obtained with DI have a typical angular resolution of about
36 degrees and are a good match to low-resolution disc-resolved Dopplergrams of
the Sun at epochs when the absolute, disc-integrated RV exceeds ~2 m/s. The RV
residuals after DI correction exhibit a dispersion of about 0.6 m/s, comparable
with existing state-of-the-art activity correction techniques. Using planet
injection-recovery tests, we also show that DI can be a powerful tool for blind
planet searches, so long as the orbital period is larger than ~100days (i.e. 3
to 4 stellar rotation periods), and that it yields planetary mass estimates
with an accuracy comparable to, for example, multi-dimensional Gaussian process
regression. Finally, we highlight some limitations of traditional DI
algorithms, which should be addressed to make DI a reliable alternative to
state-of-the-art RV-based planet search techniques.

Abstract: JWST is discovering a plethora of species in planet-forming disks around very
low-mass stars such as C2H2, C6H6, C4H2, CH3 etc. The column densities of these
species retrieved from 0D slab models are very large, e.g. of the order of
$10^{20}$\,cm$^{-2}$. This is indicating a carbon-dominated chemistry in a gas
with a high C/O ratio. The disk around 2MASS-J1605321-1993159 (M4.5) is one
such source showing a molecular pseudo-continuum of C2H2. Still two
oxygen-bearing molecules, CO and CO2 are also detected in this source. We aim
to take the next step beyond 0D slab models to interpret the spectrum. We
examine whether 2D thermo-chemical disk models can produce the large inferred
column densities of \ce{C2H2} in the inner regions of the disk and produce a
pseudo-continuum in the mid-IR spectrum. We also want to constrain whether
depletion of oxygen or enrichment of carbon is causing the high C/O ratio
triggering a carbon-dominated chemistry. We utilize the radiative
thermo-chemical disk model P{\tiny RO}D{\tiny I}M{\tiny O} to identify a disk
structure which is capable of producing the observed molecular emission of
species such as CO, CO2, C2H2, and H2O simultaneously. The spectrum is
generated using the fast line tracer FLiTs. We derive the gas temperature
$\langle T \rangle$, column density $\langle$ log$_{\rm {10}} N\rangle$ and the
emitting area $\langle r_{\rm{1}} - r_{\rm{2}} \rangle$ for these molecules
from the 2D disk model and compare them to the parameters retrieved originally
from 0D slab models. We use the different effect that changing the O or C
abundance has on CO and C2H2 respectively to discriminate between O depletion

of a gap can best explain the observations. The inner disk is strongly depleted
in dust, especially small grains ($<5\,\mu$m), and ..

Abstract: We study the impact of non-thermal leptogenesis on the spectrum of
gravitational waves (GWs) produced by a strong first-order phase transition in
the early Universe. We consider a scenario in which a heavy scalar field,
$\phi$, dominates the energy density of the early Universe and decays into
heavy right-handed neutrinos (RHNs). The subsequent decay of RHNs generates a
lepton asymmetry, which is partially converted into the observed baryon
asymmetry via the sphaleron process. The $\phi$-dominated era and the entropy
injection from the decays of $\phi$ and RHNs leave characteristic imprints on
the GW spectrum, such as damping and modified frequency dependence, that
distinguish it from the standard cosmological evolution. We identify the
parameter space in which non-thermal leptogenesis is successful, leading to
distinctive GW spectral features. We show that these GW signals can fall within
the sensitivity ranges of future detectors such as ET, DECIGO and BBO. If
observed, they would provide valuable insights into the thermal history and
dynamics of the early Universe.

Abstract: Cosmic rays scattering with neutrinos produced in supernovae induce a flux of
supernova neutrinos boosted to high energies. We calculate the neutrino flux
arising from this new mechanism in environments with large cosmic-ray and
supernova densities, such as some Active Galactic Nuclei. Under plausible
astrophysical conditions, this flux may be detectable with high-energy neutrino
telescopes, just considering the proton-neutrino scattering cross section
expected in the Standard Model. Furthermore, the center of mass energy of such
scatterings can reach $ \sqrt{s} \sim 10-100$ TeV, where the proton-neutrino
cross section may be enhanced by new physics such as extra-dimensional
theories. The boosted neutrino signal benefits from such an enhancement in the
cross section not only at the detection point on Earth, but also at production
in astrophysical sources, which allows us to set novel constraints on the
ultra-high energy proton-neutrino cross section with neutrino telescopes.

Abstract: In this work, we present the refinement of axion double level crossings
within the context of multi-axion mass mixing, specifically focusing on cases
where the number of axions exceeds two. Our investigation reveals that double
level crossings are a common phenomenon in the mass mixing of the $Z_{\mathcal
N}$ axion and axion-like particles. We introduce the general model for double
level crossings, along with several toy examples, and redefine the light and
heavy axion scenarios. In the light axion scenario, double level crossings can
occur multiple times in the large ${\mathcal N}$ limit. However, excessively
large values of ${\mathcal N}$ may also prevent the occurrence of double level
crossings. Conversely, in the heavy axion scenario, excessively small
${\mathcal N}$ may similarly prevent their occurrence. Our findings also have
some intriguing implications for axion cosmology.

Abstract: We present a neural-network framework designed to reconstruct the properties
of cosmic-ray nuclei traversing the scintillating-fiber tracking calorimeter of
the RadMap Telescope. Employing the Geant4 simulation toolkit and a simplified
model of the detector to generate training and test data, we achieve the
spectroscopic capabilities required for an accurate determination of the
biologically relevant dose that astronauts receive in space. We can reconstruct
a particle's trajectory with an angular resolution of better than $1.4^\circ$
and achieve a charge separation of better than $95\%$ for nuclei with $Z\leq8$;
specifically, we reach an accuracy of $99.8\%$ for hydrogen. The energy
resolution is $<20\%$ for energies below 1 GeV/n and elements up to iron. We
also discuss the limitations of our detector, the reconstruction framework, and
this feasibility study, as well as possible improvements.

Abstract: We present an application of computer vision methods to classify the light
curves of eclipsing binaries (EB). We have used pre-trained models based on
convolutional neural networks ($\textit{ResNet50}$) and vision transformers
($\textit{vit\_base\_patch16\_224}$), which were fine-tuned on images created
from synthetic datasets. To improve model generalisation and reduce
overfitting, we developed a novel image representation by transforming
phase-folded light curves into polar coordinates combined with hexbin
visualisation. Our hierarchical approach in the first stage classifies systems
into detached and overcontact types, and in the second stage identifies the
presence or absence of spots. The binary classification models achieved high
accuracy ($>96\%$) on validation data across multiple passbands (Gaia~$G$, $I$,
and $TESS$) and demonstrated strong performance ($>94\%$, up to $100\%$ for
$TESS$) when tested on extensive observational data from the OGLE, DEBCat, and
WUMaCat catalogues. While the primary binary classification was highly
successful, the secondary task of automated spot detection performed poorly,
revealing a significant limitation of our models for identifying subtle
photometric features. This study highlights the potential of computer vision
for EB morphological classification in large-scale surveys, but underscores the
need for further research into robust, automated spot detection.
