This poses a serious problem in the interpretation of both observations and numerical simulations. In this paper, we use filtering operators in real space to separate bulk motion from turbulence at different scales. We show how filters can be used to define consistent kinetic and magnetic energies for the bulk and turbulent component. We apply our GPU-accelerated filtering pipeline to a simulation of a major galaxy cluster merger, which is part of the PICO-Clusters suite of zoom-in cosmological simulations of massive clusters using the moving mesh code Arepo and the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model. We find that during the merger the turbulent pressure fraction on physical scales $\\lesssim$160 kpc reaches a maximum of 5%, before decreasing to 2% after $\\sim$1.3 Gyr from the core passage. These low values are consistent with recent observations of clusters with XRISM, and suggest that unless a cluster was recently perturbed by a major merger, turbulence levels are low. We then re-examine the popular multiscale iterative filter method. In our tests, we find that its use can introduce artifacts, and that it does not reliably disentangle fluctuations living on widely separated length scales. Rather, we believe it is more fruitful to use fixed-scale filters and turbulent energies to compare between simulations and observations. This work significantly improves our understanding of turbulence generation by major mergers in galaxy clusters, which can be probed by XRISM and next-generation X-ray telescopes, allowing us to connect high-resolution cosmological simulations to observations."}

We examine how dust grain distributions and environmental parameters determine the peak frequency and spectral width of AME spectral energy distribution (SED). Using Monte Carlo sampling and global sensitivity analysis, we find that AME features are dominantly controlled by three parameters: grain size, shape, and a phase-dependent environmental parameter. We also quantify the effects of SED broadening from ensembles of these dominant parameters, finding that the level of tension with observations is strongly phase dependent: Molecular Cloud (MC) is fully consistent, Dark Cloud (DC) shows minor deviations, and HII regions exhibit significant offsets in peak frequency. This points to possible issues in phase-dependent AME extraction, interstellar medium (ISM) environment identification, or underlying theoretical tension. Ensemble variations in both grain size and environmental parameters are required to reproduce the observed spread in peak frequency and spectral width. We further propose moment expansion and emulation-based inference methods for future AME spectral fit and feature analysis."}

We show that satellite galaxies are significantly affected by the environment in all simulation models, with their gas fraction and star formation rate (SFR) suppressed in overdense regions compared to similar mass satellites in underdense environments at $z=0$. Central galaxies are less sensitive to environment but tend to show lower gas fraction and SFR in overdense regions at low stellar mass, transitioning to higher gas fraction and SFR for massive galaxies in higher-density environments.

Matching haloes to corresponding N-body (dark matter-only) simulations, we find that virial masses decrease owing to the ejection of baryons by feedback. Relative to N-body simulations, halo profiles show an increased dark matter density in the center (due to radiative cooling) and a decrease in density farther out (due to feedback), with both effects being strongest in SIMBA (> 450% increase at r < 0.01 Rvir). The clustering of dark matter strongly responds to changes in baryonic physics, with dark matter power spectra in some simulations from each model showing as much as 20% suppression or increase in power at k ~ 10 h/Mpc relative to N-body simulations. We find that the dark matter back-reaction depends intrinsically on cosmology (Omega_m and sigma_8) at fixed baryonic physics, and varies strongly with the details of the feedback implementation.

However, true solar system analog planets remain inaccessible. A major goal for exoplanet science over the coming decades is to observe, and characterize, temperate rocky planets and cool gas giants in orbit around solar-type stars, with the prospect of detecting signs of habitability or even life. Characterization and categorization of these planets relies on direct spectroscopic observations capable of identifying molecular species in their atmospheres; however, these observations represent a substantial engineering challenge due to the extreme contrast between a temperate, Earth-sized exoplanet and its parent star. NASA's next flagship mission, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) - planned for launch in the mid-2040s - will boast a coronagraphic instrument capable of reaching the needed 10$^{-10}$ contrast, on an ultrastable platform enabling long integration times to achieve the required signal to noise. HWO will cover near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavelengths, enabling detections of key biosignature molecules and habitability indicators such as ocean glint and a vegetation `red edge'. Via early involvement in this groundbreaking observatory, including a potential UK instrument contribution, the UK exoplanet community now has an important opportunity to influence the telescope's design. To maintain our international competitiveness, we must be at the forefront of observational campaigns with HWO when it eventually launches, and this comes with the need for parallel development in laboratory astrophysics and computational modelling. Maximising our exploitation of this transformative NASA mission requires consistent financial support in these areas across the next two decades."}

These groups contain 20-30 galaxies with high (>75%) membership probability. Our study reveals both passive-density and active-density relations: late-type galaxies (LTGs) prefer higher central overdensities than early-type galaxies (ETGs) across all groups, and many massive LTGs exhibit colors typical of quiescent galaxies. We identify red sequences (RS) in 5 groups, prominently established at z < 1, with early emergence in the RS locus up to z ~ 2.2.\n  This suggests group environments represent a transitional phase where star formation quenching precedes morphological transformation, contrasting with the classical morphology-density relation in rich clusters. In the central regions (~33 arcsec / 100 kpc from centers), we identified 86 galaxies: 23 (~27%) ETGs and 63 (~73%) LTGs. High-mass galaxies (M_star > 10^10.5 M_sun) undergo rapid quenching over ~1 Gyr, becoming predominantly spheroidal ETGs. This indicates morphological transformation accelerates in massive systems during peak cosmic star formation. Intermediate-mass galaxies (10^9 < M_star/M_sun < 10^10.5) show mild quenching, while low-mass galaxies (M_star < 10^9 M_sun) remain largely star-forming; here, environmental processes suppress star formation without destroying disks, suggesting group quenching operates on longer timescales than mass quenching. Overall, mass-dependent quenching dominates the high-mass end, while environment shapes lower-mass systems. The HLAGN fraction for both groups and field increases with redshift, peaking at z ~ 2, with groups consistently showing higher fractions. We suggest AGN feedback partially drives rapid quenching in high-mass galaxies, while mergers may trigger AGN activity."}

The resulting structure reproduces the stiffness and curvature behavior across the nuclear-pasta regime reported in the literature, validating our treatment of the crust-core transition. From this model, we derive updated moments of inertia, crustal mass fractions, and the effective number of neutrons contributing to the star's magnetic moment. Comparing these quantities with spin-down inferred magnetic dipole moments indicates that the observed magnetic fields of particularly millisecond pulsars can be sustained entirely by the crustal neutron polarization, requiring alignment of only about $\\lesssim5.5\\%$ ($99\\%$ C.L.) of the neutrons in the crust. This finding supports a crust-confined magnetic-field origin for non-magnetar neutron stars, consistent with magneto-thermal evolution studies, and provides a quantitative framework for connecting neutron-star observables to its underlying structure."}

During transit, the small fraction of starlight that passes through a planet's atmosphere emerges with the fingerprints of atmospheric gases, aerosols and structure. During eclipse, the relatively small contribution of light from the planet itself may be observed as the planet is occulted by the star. For planets in near-edge-on, short-period orbits, observing the system throughout an entire orbit allows the varying flux from the planet to be extracted as the illuminated `dayside' rotates in and out of view. With spectroscopic observations, we can characterize not only the overall composition of the atmosphere, but also glean insights into atmospheric structure and dynamics. With over 6,000 transiting planets now discovered, such observations are currently our only window into a consistent sample of planetary atmospheres large enough to attempt a population-level study, a critical next step for our understanding of atmospheric science. The vast exoplanet population provides a laboratory for atmospheric physics, including chemistry, dynamics, cloud processes and evolution; extending these results to a larger number of targets will allow us to explore the effects of equilibrium temperature, gravity, mass and parent star type on atmospheric properties, as well as map observable trends to formation scenarios. These findings are critical for addressing STFC's Science Vision Challenge B: how do stars and planetary systems develop and how do they support the existence of life?.

Using the first cloud-cloud collision simulations that model individual star formation and accretion with all stellar feedback mechanisms, we explore the morphological evolution, star formation efficiency (SFE), fragmentation, stellar mass distribution, and feedback-driven gas dispersal. Our results show that cloud collisions substantially enhance the rate and timing of star formation compared to isolated scenarios, though the final SFE remains broadly similar across all setups. Lower collision velocities facilitate prolonged gravitational interaction and accumulation of gas, promoting sustained star formation characterized by elongated filamentary structures. Conversely, high-velocity collisions induce rapid gas compression and turbulent motions, leading to intense but transient episodes of star formation, which are curtailed by feedback-driven dispersal. The orientation of the magnetic field markedly affects collision outcomes. Parallel fields allow gas to collapse efficiently along magnetic lines, forming fewer but more massive stars. In contrast, perpendicular fields generate significant magnetic pressure, which stabilizes the shock-compressed gas and delays gravitational collapse, resulting in more distributed and less massive stellar fragments. Radiative feedback from massive stars consistently regulates star formation, halting further gas accretion at moderate efficiencies (10-15%) and initiating feedback-driven dispersal. Although the cloud dynamics vary significantly, the stellar mass function remains robust across scenarios-shaped modestly by magnetic orientation but only weakly influenced by collision velocity."}

Comparing the numerical results from the AbacusSummit of cosmological simulations, we derive a non-parametric model for the redshift asymmetry distribution of void galaxies, which turns out to be almost universally valid for a very broad range of cosmologies including dynamic dark energy models with time-dependent equation of states as well as the $Λ$CDM models with various initial conditions. We discover that the universality of this model breaks down only if the running of scalar spectral index deviates from zero, detecting a consistent trend that a more positive (negative) running yields a lower (higher) redshift asymmetry of voids than the model predictions. Given that non-standard inflations usually predict non-zero runnings of the spectral index and that the redshift asymmetry distribution of voids is a readily observable quantity, we conclude that this new diagnostics will pave another path toward understanding the true mechanism of inflation."}

In particular, coronagraph instrumentation needs to be matured for higher throughput, deeper contrasts, and better broadband performance, while also considering their sensitivity and ability to mitigate the impact of telescope instability and wavefront error (WFE), which can have a profound impact on exo-Earth imaging. The success of various proposed HWO mission architectures is often represented by the estimated exo-Earth candidate yield. Computation of the minimum exposure time to achieve the required signal-to-noise on a given target, using an exposure time calculator (ETC), is a key part of yield estimation. The impacts of coronagraph sensitivity, WFE, and wavefront sensing and control (WFS&C) have been well studied in the context of developing error budgets for missions and instruments such as the Roman Coronagraph Instrument, but there is currently no easily accessible way to incorporate the effects of these key parameters into calculating exposure times for HWO. To address this, we developed the Error Budget Software (EBS) - an open-source tool that synthesizes sensitivity, WFE, and WFS&C information for a variety of temporal and spatial scales and directly interfaces with the open-source yield code EXOSIMS to produce exposure times. We demonstrate how EBS can be used for mission error budgeting using the example of the Ultrastable Observatory Roadmap Team (USORT) observatory design.

We investigate global solutions for rotating polytropic flows in a much wider parameter space to understand their general properties within the slim disk approximation and a viscosity description suitable for both low- and high-angular-momentum flows. We find that the mass accretion rate for flows with a small Bondi radius decreases steeply as the gas angular momentum increases, while for those with a large Bondi radius, it decreases gradually. Therefore, the decrease of mass accretion rate due to gas rotation can be significant or mild depending on the Bondi radius. We further investigate global solutions of accretion with outflows using the ADIOS model of R. D. Blandford & M. C. Begelman. Stronger outflows in general slightly increase the mass inflow rate at the outer boundary, but the actual mass accreted into the black hole decreases by orders of magnitude. Stronger outflows also weaken the dependence of the mass accretion rate on the gas angular momentum when the viscosity parameter α is small. The intricate dependence of the mass inflow rate at the outer boundary and the mass accretion rate into the black hole on gas angular momentum will have interesting implications for the growth of black holes and their energy output."}

In particular, we focused on (1) identifying biosignatures that have spectral features in the UV-Vis-NIR wavelength range and defining their measurement requirements, (2) determining additional information needed from the planet and planet system to interpret biosignatures and assess the likelihood of false positives, and (3) assembling current knowledge of likely HWO target stars and identify which properties of host stars and systems are most critical to know in advance of HWO. The Living Worlds atmospheric biosignatures science case is considered one of the key drivers in the design of the observatory.

These features point to recent cold gas accretion onto the outer disk. From the asymmetric light profile, we estimate a gas accretion rate of $\\sim 11 M_\\odot$ $yr^{-1}$, providing evidence of active disk growth at intermediate redshift."}

In this work, we evaluate the efficacy of a data cube treatment methodology, previously proposed by our research group, for analyses focused on the stellar and gas kinematics. To do that, we used data cubes of the central regions of the galaxies NGC 3115 and NGC 4699, obtained with the Integral Field Unit of the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph. For each galaxy, we analysed three data cubes: non-treated, filtered (with the Butterworth spatial filtering) and filtered and deconvolved (with the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution). For each data cube, we performed a dynamical modelling, using Jeans Anisotropic Models, to obtain, among other parameters, the masses of the central supermassive black holes. Both for NGC 3115 and NGC 4699, the values of the parameters provided by the dynamical modelling from the non-treated, filtered and filtered and deconvolved data cubes were compatible, at the 1-$σ$ level. However, the use of the Butterworth spatial filtering decreased the uncertainty of the parameters. The additional use of the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution decreased even more the uncertainty of the parameters. The complete data treatment procedure resulted in decreases of 41% and 45% in the uncertainties of the supermassive black hole masses in NGC 3115 and NGC 4699, respectively. These results indicate that our treatment procedure not only does not compromise analyses of data cubes focused on the stellar or gas kinematics, but actually improves the quality of the results."}

The possible presence of a significant dark matter component in the form of primordial black holes suggests that dark halo formation simulations should be commenced well before redshift z = 100. Unlike standard CDM candidates, PBHs behave as dense, non-relativistic matter from their inception in the radiation-dominated era. This allows them to seed gravitational potential wells and begin clustering earlier. We find that starting N-body simulations at redshifts even before matter-radiation equality yield galaxy bulk flow velocities that are systematically larger than those predicted by standard LCDM models. The early, high-mass concentrations established by PBHs lead to a more rapid and efficient gravitational acceleration of surrounding baryonic and dark matter, generating larger peculiar velocities that remain coherent over scales of hundreds of Mpc. Furthermore, a sub- population of PBHs in the 10^-20 to 10^-17 solar mass range would lose a non-negligible fraction of their mass via Hawking radiation over cosmological timescales. This evaporation process converts matter into radiation, so a time-varying matter density parameter, Omega_m', is introduced, which behaves like a boosted radiation term in the Friedmann equation. This dynamic term acts to reduce the Hubble tension. A higher effective Omega_r in the early universe reduces the sound horizon at the epoch of recombination. PBH mass loss also influences fits to the equation of state parameter, w, at low redshift. The naive N-body modelling presented here suggests investigation with tried and tested cosmology codes should be carried out, by introducing mass losing PBHs and starting the evolution as early as practicable."}

Accurate photometric calibration of astronomical photographic plates remains a fundamental challenge in astronomy, especially when bridging historical photographic data with modern observations due to the mismatch of spectral sensitivities of photographic plates and passbands of modern calibration catalogs.

We intend to derive consistent natural magnitudes for celestial sources within the intrinsic photometric systems of astronomical photographic plates by using Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) blue photometer (BP) and red photometer (RP) low-resolution spectral data and to show its superiority to former methods. Methods. We compiled spectral characteristic data for emulsions and filters applied in photometric observations using glass plates. The collected color sensitivities, modified by atmospheric reddening depending on the air mass, are then used to compute accurate natural magnitudes and fluxes of objects in the photographic plates through synthetic photometry, utilizing a catalog of Gaia spectral energy distributions (SEDs) over the wavelength range 330 nm to 1050 nm (XP spectra). This process uses GaiaXPy, a Python library designed to handle Gaia DR3 spectral data. These natural magnitudes are then compared with results from the color term method used to compile the data in existing photoplate archives. Results. Comparing the synthetic magnitudes with those existing in the Archives of Photographic PLates for Astronomical USE (APPLAUSE), we were able to reveal systematic errors of the existing data in the range of +/-0.3 mag and higher. In addition, the presented method allows for an accommodation of stars with similar color index but of different luminosity classes as well as an effective correction of atmospheric reddening at higher air masses, approximately 0.2 mag."}

It represents a key phase of matter in the baryon cycle involving accretion, feedback, outflows, and gas recycling. Redshifted $21$ cm line emission originating from galaxies serves as a key tracer for investigating HI gas and its dynamics in the interstellar medium (ISM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM), and enables the study of galaxy evolution. Nonetheless, direct detections of HI are currently limited to $z \\leq 0.4$ due to the inherently weak $21$ cm emission line. Ongoing and upcoming large radio surveys aim to detect $21$ cm emission from galaxies up to $z \\gtrsim 1$ with unprecedented sensitivity. In current work, we present a novel approach for creating optical-HI joint mock catalogs for upcoming SKA precursor surveys: MIGHTEE-HI and LADUMA with MeerKAT and WALLABY with ASKAP. Incorporation of optical properties along with HI in our mock catalogs makes these a powerful tool for making predictions for upcoming surveys and provides a benchmark for exploring the HI science (e.g., conditional HIMF and optical-to-HI scaling relations) expected from these surveys. As a case study, we show the use of the joint catalogs for predicting the expected outcome of stacking detection for average HI mass in galaxies that are below the threshold for direct detection. We show that combining stacking observations with the number of direct detections puts a strong constraint on the HI mass function, especially in the regime where the number of direct detections is small, as often happens near the farther edge of HI surveys. This intermediate step may be used to set priors for the full determination of the HI mass function."}

This will continue as next-generation telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) take shape. Under increasingly demanding power consumption, and increasingly challenging radio environments, science goals may become intractable with conventional von Neumann computing due to related power requirements. Neuromorphic computing offers a compelling alternative, and combined with a desire for data-driven methods, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising real-time power-efficient alternative. Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection is an attractive use-case for SNNs where recent exploration holds promise. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of the potential impact of deploying varying neuromorphic approaches across key stages in radio astronomy processing pipelines for several existing and near-term instruments. Our analysis paves a realistic path from near-term FPGA deployment of SNNs in existing instruments, allowing the addition of advanced data-driven RFI detection for no capital cost, to neuromorphic ASICs for future instruments, finding that commercially available solutions could reduce the power budget for key processing elements by up to three orders of magnitude, transforming the operational budget of the observatory. High-data-rate spectrographic processing could be a well-suited target for the neuromorphic computing industry, as we cast radio telescopes as the world's largest in-sensor compute challenge."}

Using a unified framework, we analyze two IDE models--coupled quintessence and coupled fluid--against the latest CMB (Planck, ACT, SPT), DESI BAO, and SN (including DES-Dovekie recalibrated) data. Both IDE scenarios show robust evidence for non-vanishing interactions at the 3-5$σ$ level, with marginalized constraints significantly deviating from the $Λ$CDM limit. This preference persists even under DES-Dovekie SN recalibration, which weakens dynamical DE evidence. Crucially, for the same number of free parameters, IDE models provide fits to low- and high-redshift data that match or exceed the performance of the CPL dynamical DE parametrization. Our results establish IDE as a physically motivated alternative to dynamical DE, highlighting the necessity of future cosmological perturbation measurements (e.g., weak lensing, galaxy clustering) to distinguish between these paradigms."}

It combines a fast particle-tree (PT) algorithm for long-range forces with a high-accuracy particle-particle (PP, direct $N$-body) solver for short-range interactions. Preserving both PT efficiency and PP accuracy requires a robust PT-PP switching criterion. We introduce a simple free-fall-based switching criterion for general stellar systems, alongside the commonly used velocity-dispersion-based ($σ$-based) criterion. Using the \\textsc{petar} code with the P$^3$T scheme and slow-down algorithmic regularization for binaries and higher-order multiples, we perform extensive simulations of star clusters to evaluate how each criterion affects energy conservation and binary evolution. For systems in virial equilibrium, we find that the free-fall-based criterion is generally more accurate for low-$σ$ or loose clusters containing binaries, whereas the $σ$-based criterion is better suited for high-$σ$ systems. Under subvirial or fractal initial conditions, both criteria struggle to maintain high energy conservation; however, the free-fall-based criterion improves as the tree timestep is reduced, whereas the $σ$-based degrades due to its low-accuracy treatment of two-body encounters."}

While residual observational systematics and local-structure effects cannot be definitively excluded, this result motivates the exploration of alternative physical interpretations beyond the minimal $Λ$CDM framework. We investigate whether Scalar--Tensor--Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) can provide a consistent explanation for an enhanced large-scale anisotropic dipole without violating existing constraints from early-universe cosmology, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole, galaxy dynamics, weak lensing, or the observed late-time matter power spectrum. The radio number-count dipole probes ultra-large-scale, anisotropic structure and coherent gravitational response, rather than virialized dynamics or linear growth alone. In STVG-MOG, a scale- and time-dependent effective gravitational coupling preserves standard cosmological evolution at early times and on small to intermediate scales, while amplifying gravitational response on gigaparsec scales. This scale-selective enhancement can increase the large-scale structure contribution to the radio dipole without overproducing power on smaller scales. If the observed dipole excess reflects a physical cosmological signal rather than residual systematics, STVG-MOG offers a viable and testable alternative interpretation. It is demonstrated that the radio dipole anomaly provides a novel probe of gravitational physics on the largest observable scales."}

Departing from the commonly studied non-minimal couplings to gravity, our framework considers a real spectator scalar field coupled quadratically to spacetime curvature invariants. We show that the rapid reorganization of spacetime curvature at the end of inflation can dynamically render the dark matter field tachyonic, triggering a short-lived phase of spontaneous symmetry breaking and explosive particle production. As a concrete and theoretically controlled example, we focus on the Gauss-Bonnet topological invariant. By combining analytical estimates with fully non-linear $3+1$ classical lattice simulations, we track the out-of-equilibrium evolution of the system and compute the resulting dark matter abundance. We find that this purely gravitational mechanism can robustly reproduce the observed dark matter relic density over a wide range of masses and inflationary scales, providing also a simple fitting function that enables a lattice-independent application of our results."}

This work processes in-phase and quadrature (IQ) snapshots collected by the LuGRE receiver in cis-lunar space and on the lunar surface to assess multi-frequency, multi-constellation signal availability. Signals from additional systems beyond GPS and Galileo, including RNSS and SBAS constellations, are observable and successfully acquired exclusively in the recorded IQ snapshots. These observations provide the first experimental evidence that signals from multiple constellations, including systems not supported by LuGRE realtime operations, are detectable at unprecedented distances from Earth. Useful observables can be extracted from the IQ snapshots, despite minimal sampling rates, 4-bit quantization, and short durations (200 ms-2 s), through a hybrid coherent/non-coherent acquisition stage compensating for code Doppler. These observations are exploited to tune simulation tools and to perform extended simulation campaigns, showing that the inclusion of additional constellations significantly improves availability; for a 26 dB-Hz acquisition threshold, the fraction of epochs with at least four visible satellites increases from 11% to 46% of the total epoch count. These findings indicate that BeiDou, RNSS, and SBAS signals can substantially enhance GNSS-based autonomy for lunar and cislunar missions."}

In recent years, scalar-induced GWs have attracted significant attention because they may serve as the observational signature of primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the early universe. The formation of PBHs requires large density perturbations, which can naturally emerge in some models of inflation. When these large density fluctuations couple, they act as a source for scalar-induced GWs at second order. In this work, we extend the existing formalism by including linear tensor fluctuations as an additional source term. This gives rise to two new classes of second-order GWs: those sourced by scalar-tensor couplings (scalar-tensor induced GWs) and those quadratic in tensor modes (tensor-tensor induced GWs). We find that the scalar-tensor contribution becomes significant if first-order tensor modes are enhanced, whilst the tensor-tensor contribution remains subdominant. Moreover, we demonstrate that the spectrum of scalar-tensor induced GWs exhibits an unphysical enhancement in the UV limit when the primordial scalar power spectrum is insufficiently peaked. To investigate whether this can be resolved, we study third-order induced GWs and their correlation with primordial GWs. We find that this new contribution suppresses the overall signal but does not cancel the unphysical enhancement. Possible explanations for this behaviour are discussed and left for future work. Finally, we explore the effect of primordial scalar non-Gaussianity on the spectrum of scalar-tensor induced GWs, building on previous results showing its impact on scalar-induced GWs."}

To derive the initial mass function (IMF) of a large sample of NYMGs, we developed and applied an algorithm that uses photometry and astrometry from Gaia DR3 to detect NYMGs in a kinematic space. We inferred individual masses from the photometry of both the detected and the previously known candidates. We estimated the IMFs for 33 groups, 30 of them for the first time, in an average mass range $0.1<m/M_\\odot<5$ with some groups going as low as $0.02~M_{\\odot}$ and as high as $10~M_{\\odot}$. We parameterized these IMFs using a log-normal for $m<1~M_\\odot$ and a power-law for $m>1~M_\\odot$. We detected 4166 source candidate members of 44 known groups, including 2545 new candidates. We recovered 44-54\\% of the literature candidates and estimated a contamination rate from old field stars of 16-24\\%. The candidates of the detected groups distribute along young isochrones, which suggests that they are potential members of NYMGs. Parameterizations of both the average of the 33 IMFs based on our detections ($m_c=0.25\\pm0.17~M_{\\odot}$, $σ_c=0.45\\pm0.17$, and $α=-2.26\\pm0.09$) and the one based on the known candidates from the literature ($m_c=0.22\\pm0.14~M_{\\odot}$, $σ_c=0.45\\pm0.17$, and $α=-2.45\\pm0.06$) are in agreement with the IMF parameterization of the solar neighbourhood and young stellar associations. Our parameterization of the average IMF together with the distribution of the detected group members along young isochrones provide strong evidence suggesting that the NYMGs are remnants of individual stellar associations and clusters and that there are no systematic biases in our detection and in the literature in the range $0.1<m/M_{\\odot}<10$."}

We compute the duty cycle for a realistic population of PBH binaries, isolating the shot-noise, popcorn and continuous contributions to the GWB.

Infrared interferometry with VLTI/GRAVITY is now resolving BLR-scale emission, with data for NGC 3783 consistent with a rotating, geometrically thick configuration. However, the processes shaping the spectra remain poorly constrained, and the cloud models are tuned phenomenologically rather than derived from first-principles predictions. We address this by coupling three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of gas around a supermassive black hole with radiative-transfer calculations using Cloudy, comparing the results to the SINFONI Br$γ$ profile of NGC 3783. We find that Br$γ$ arises from ionized gas in the surface of the rotating thin disk, with electron temperatures of approximately $T_e \\approx 10^4$ K and number densities of $n_e \\approx 10^8-10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$. However, the intrinsic line profile produced by the RHD kinematics is narrower than observed and displays substructure. An approximate treatment of the electron scattering suggests that scattering in surrounding diffuse ionized gas significantly broadens and smooths the intrinsic Br$γ$ profile, making it consistent with the observed profile. This scattering medium has an electron temperature of $10^4 - 10^5$ K, and a number density of $n \\lesssim 10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. Although a best-fit viewing angle of $\\approx 15$ deg is suggested, the scattered line is notably less sensitive to inclination than the intrinsic line. The observed BLR profiles may be understood as the intrinsic emission viewed through an electron-scattering haze, such that some spectral detail is plausibly redistributed rather than seen directly."}

Our IA implementation in the Flagship simulation takes into account photometric properties of galaxies as well as their dark matter host halos. We compare simulations against theory predictions, determining the parameters of two of the most widely used IA models: the Non Linear Alignment (NLA) and the Tidal Alignment and Tidal Torquing (TATT) models. We measure the amplitude of the simulated IA signal as a function of galaxy magnitude and colour in the redshift range $0.1<z<2.1$. We find that both NLA and TATT can accurately describe the IA signal in the simulation down to scales of $6$-$7 \\,h^{-1}\\,$Mpc. We measure alignment amplitudes for red galaxies comparable to those of the observations, with samples not used in the calibration procedure. For blue galaxies, our constraints are consistent with zero alignments in our first redshift bin $0.1 < z < 0.3$, but we detect a non-negligible signal at higher redshift, which is, however, consistent with the upper limits set by observational constraints. Additionally, several hydrodynamical simulations predict alignment for spiral galaxies, in agreement with our findings. Finally, the evolution of alignment with redshift is realistic and comparable to that determined in the observations. However, we find that the commonly adopted redshift power-law for IA fails to reproduce the simulation alignments above $z=1.1$. A significantly better agreement is obtained when a luminosity dependence is included, capturing the intrinsic luminosity evolution with redshift in magnitude-limited surveys. We conclude that the Flagship IA simulation is a useful tool for translating current IA constraints into predictions for IA contamination of Euclid-like samples."}

These advances offer deeper insight into persistent challenges in astrophysics and our understanding of the Universe's evolution. A critical component of this progress is the reliable estimation of photometric redshifts (Pz). To improve the precision and efficiency of such estimations, the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to large-scale astronomical datasets has become essential. This study presents a new ensemble-based ML framework aimed at predicting Pz for faint galaxies and higher redshift ranges, relying solely on optical (grizy) photometric data. The proposed architecture integrates several learning algorithms, including gradient boosting machine, extreme gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, and artificial neural networks, within a scaled ensemble structure. By using bagged input data, the ensemble approach delivers improved predictive performance compared to stand-alone models. The framework demonstrates consistent accuracy in estimating redshifts, maintaining strong performance up to z ~ 4. The model is validated using publicly available data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program by the Subaru Telescope. Our results show marked improvements in the precision and reliability of Pz estimation. Furthermore, this approach closely adheres to-and in certain instances exceeds-the benchmarks specified in the LSST Science Requirements Document.

We construct a semi-analytic model of galaxy ellipticities and alignments in the \\Euclid Flagship simulation to predict this contamination in Euclid's weak lensing observations. Galaxy shapes and orientations are determined by the corresponding properties of the host haloes in the underlying $N$-body simulation, as well as the relative positions of galaxies within their halo. Alignment strengths are moderated via stochastic misalignments, separately for central and satellite galaxies and conditional on the galaxy's redshift, luminosity, and rest-frame colour. The resulting model is calibrated against galaxy ellipticity statistics from the COSMOS Survey, selected alignment measurements based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey samples, and galaxy orientations extracted from the Horizon-AGN hydrodynamic simulation at redshift $z=1$. The best-fit model has a total of 12 alignment parameters and generally reproduces the calibration data sets well within the $1σ$ statistical uncertainties of the observations and the \\flagship simulation, with notable exceptions for the most luminous sub-samples on small physical scales. The statistical power of the calibration data and the volume of the single \\flagship realisation are still too small to provide informative prior ranges for intrinsic alignment amplitudes in relevant galaxy samples.

In this process, astronomers leverage specialized tools to analyze spectra and construct reliable catalogs. However, this practice has become the primary bottleneck, as it is fundamentally incapable of scaling with the data deluge from modern spectroscopic surveys. To bridge this gap, we propose Spec-o3, a tool-augmented vision-language agent that performs astronomer-aligned spectral inspection via interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning. Spec-o3 is trained with a two-stage post-training recipe: cold-start supervised fine-tuning on expert inspection trajectories followed by outcome-based reinforcement learning on rare-type verification tasks. Evaluated on five rare-object identification tasks from LAMOST, Spec-o3 establishes a new State-of-the-Art, boosting the macro-F1 score from 28.3 to 76.5 with a 7B parameter base model and outperforming both proprietary VLMs and specialized deep models. Crucially, the agent demonstrates strong generalization to unseen inspection tasks across survey shifts (from LAMOST to SDSS/DESI). Expert evaluations confirm that its reasoning traces are coherent and physically consistent, supporting transparent and trustworthy decision-making.

Four of these correspond to classic thermal dust tracers, namely H i (HI4PI), CO (Dame et al. 2001a), Hα (WHAM, Haffner et al. (2003a, 2016)), and dust extinction (Gaia; Edenhofer et al. 2024), while the fifth is ionized carbon (C ii) emission as observed by COBE- FIRAS. We jointly fit these five templates to each frequency channel through standard multi-variate linear regression. At frequencies higher than 1 THz, we find that the dominant tracer is in fact C ii, and above 10 THz this component accounts for almost the entire fitted signal; at frequencies below 1 THz, its importance is second only to H i. We further find that all five components are well described by a modified blackbody spectral energy density (SED) up to some component-dependent maximum frequency ranging between 1 and 5 THz. In this interpretation, the C ii-correlated component is the hottest among all five, with an effective temperature of about 25 K. The Hα component has a temperature of 18 K, and, unlike the other four, is observed in absorption rather than emission. Despite the simplicity of this model, which relies only on external templates coupled to spatially isotropic SEDs, we find that it captures 98 % of the full signal root mean squared (RMS) below 1 THz. This high efficiency suggests that spatial variations in the thermal dust SED, as for instance reported by Planck and other experiments, may be more economically modelled on large angular scales in terms of a spatial mixing of individually isotropic physical components."}

Recent observations suggest that efficient dust growth may begin early, in the protostellar envelopes, potentially even before the formation of the disk. Three-dimensional models of protostellar evolution, addressing multi-size dust growth, gas and dust dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics, are required to characterize the dust evolution in the embedded stages of star formation. We aim to establish a new framework for dust evolution models, following in 3D the dust size distribution both in time and space, in MHD models describing the formation and evolution of star-disk systems, at low numerical cost. We present our work coupling the COALA dust evolution module into the code RAMSES, performing the first 3D MHD simulation of protostellar collapse including simultaneously polydisperse dust growth modeled by the Smoluchowski equation as well as dust dynamics in the terminal velocity approximation. Ice-coated micron-sized grains can rapidly grow in the envelope and survive by not entering the fragmentation regime. The evolution of the dust size distribution is highly anisotropic due to the turbulent nature of the collapse and the development of favorable locations such as outflow cavity walls, which enhance locally the dust-to-gas ratio. We analyzed the first 3D non-ideal MHD simulations that self-consistently account for the dust dynamics and growth during the protostellar stage. Very early in the lifetime of a young embedded protostar, micron-sized grains can grow, and locally the dust size distribution deviates significantly from the MRN initial shape. This new numerical method opens the perspective to treat simultaneously gas/dust dynamics and dust growth in 3D simulations at a low numerical cost for several astrophysical environments."}

Following a companion analysis of Planck HFI, the four components of this model correspond to \"hot dust\", \"cold dust\", \"nearby dust\", and \"Halpha correlated dust\", respectively, and each component is modelled in terms of a fixed spatial template and a spatially isotropic spectral energy density (SED) defined by an overall free amplitude for each DIRBE channel. Except for the cold dust amplitude, which is only robustly detected in the 240 micron channel, we measure statistically significant template amplitudes for all components in all DIRBE channels between 12 and 240 micron. In the 3.5 and 4.9 micron channels, only the hot component is detected, while the 1.25 and 2.2 micron channels are too dominated by starlight emission to allow robust dust detections. The total number of DIRBE-specific degrees of freedom in this model is 25. Despite this low dimensionality, the resulting total SED agrees well with recent astrodust predictions. At both low and high frequencies, more than 95 % of the frequency map variance is captured by the model, while at 60 and 100 micron about 70 % of the signal variance is successfully accounted for. The hot dust component, which in a companion paper has been found to correlate strongly with C ii emission, has the highest absolute amplitude in all DIRBE frequency channels; in particular, at 3.5 micron, which is known to be dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, this component accounts for at least 80 % of the total signal. This analysis represents an important step towards establishing a joint concordance model of thermal dust emission applicable to both the microwave and infrared regimes."}

A core model within this paradigm is Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), where lightweight functions are deployed and triggered on demand, scaling seamlessly with workload. FaaS offers flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and fine-grained scalability, qualities particularly relevant for large-scale scientific infrastructures where data volumes are too large to centralise and computation must increasingly occur close to the data. The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) exemplifies this challenge. Once operational, it will generate about 700~PB of data products annually, distributed across the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet), a federation of international centres providing storage, computing, and analysis services. In such a context, FaaS offers a mechanism to bring computation to the data. We studied the principles of serverless and FaaS computing and explored their application to radio astronomy workflows. Representative functions for astrophysical data analysis were developed and deployed, including micro-functions derived from existing libraries and wrappers around domain-specific applications. In particular, a Gaussian convolution function was implemented and integrated within the SRCNet ecosystem. The use case demonstrates that FaaS can be embedded into the existing SRCNet ecosystem of services, allowing functions to run directly at sites where data replicas are stored. This reduces latency, minimises transfers, and improves efficiency, aligning with federated, data-proximate computation. The results show that serverless models provide a scalable and efficient pathway to address the data volumes of the SKA era."}

We use an ultra-deep broadband spectral survey of G+0.693-0.027, carried out with the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes, to conduct the astronomical search. We report the first interstellar detection of lactaldehyde (CH$_3$CH(OH)C(O)H) and methoxyacetaldehyde (CH$_3$OCH$_2$C(O)H), together with the second detections (i.e., confirmation) of methyl acetate (CH$_3$C(O)OCH$_3$) and hydroxyacetone (CH$_3$C(O)CH$_2$OH), and new detections in this source of both $anti$- and $gauche$- conformers of ethyl formate (CH$_3$CH$_2$OC(O)H), the latter tentatively. In contrast, neither propionic acid, CH$_3$CH$_2$C(O)OH, nor glycidol, c-CH$_2$OCHCH$_2$OH (i.e., the most and the least stable species within the C$_3$H$_6$O$_2$ family, respectively) were detected, and we provide upper limits on their fractional abundances of $\\leq$1.5 $\\times$ 10$^{-10}$ and $\\leq$3.7 $\\times$ 10$^{-11}$. Interestingly, all C$_3$H$_6$O$_2$ isomers can be synthesized through radical-radical reactions on the surface of dust grains, ultimately tracing back to CO as the parent molecule. We suggest that formation of the detected isomers is mainly driven by successive hydrogenation of CO, producing CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CH$_2$OH as the primary parent species. Conversely, propionic acid is thought to originate from the oxygenation of CO via the HOCO intermediate, which help us rationalize its non-detection. Overall, our findings notably expand the known chemical inventory of the interstellar medium and provide direct observational evidence that increasingly complex chemistry involving O-bearing species occurs in space."}

In particular, oxygen-bearing monosubstituted aromatics, likely including phenol, have been identified in the coma of comet 67P. This suggests that, earlier in the star and planet formation evolution, icy grains may act as both reservoirs and sites of functionalization for these small aromatics. We investigate the ice-phase reactivity of singlet oxygen atoms (O($^1$D)) with benzene, using ozone as a precursor that is readily photodissociated by relatively low-energy. Our experiments show that O($^1$D) efficiently reacts with benzene, forming phenol, benzene oxide, and oxepine as the main products. Phenol formation is temperature-independent, consistent with a barrierless insertion mechanism. In contrast, the formation of benzene oxide/oxepine shows a slight temperature dependence, suggesting that additional reaction pathways involving either ground-state or excited-state oxygen atoms may contribute. In H$_2$O and \\COO ice matrices we find that dilution does not suppress formation of phenol. We extrapolate an experimental upper limit for the benzene-to-phenol conversion fraction of 27-44$\\%$ during the lifetime of an interstellar cloud, assuming O($^1$D) production rates based on CO$_2$ ice abundances and a cosmic-ray induced UV field.

Using state-of-the-art PISN light curves, spectral energy distributions, and synthetic spectra, we show that a PISN at $z\\simeq 15$ can plausibly reproduce the observed brightness, temporal evolution, photometry, and NIRSpec spectrum. We compare this scenario with alternative interpretations, including a local Y0 brown dwarf, and discuss observational tests to discriminate among them. If confirmed, this event would provide a rare window onto Population III stars, and highlights the importance of transient contamination in ultra-high redshift galaxy samples."}

Drawing an explicit parallel between axion field dynamics and synchronization in coupled oscillator systems, we show that a macroscopic axion phase can arise dynamically from initially incoherent configurations through gradient-driven ordering in an expanding Universe. In this framework, the misalignment angle is not a fundamental initial condition but a collective variable that becomes well defined only once phase coherence develops. Using a simple lattice model, we illustrate how the collective phase is selected prior to the onset of axion oscillations, providing a dynamical basis for the standard misalignment picture. This perspective offers a new way of organizing axion initial-condition sensitivity, reframes anthropic small-angle arguments in terms of phase-ordering efficiency, and suggests a broader connection between fine-tuning and emergent collective dynamics in the early Universe."}

This study characterizes the properties of this dynamic gas flow. Methods: Combining data from the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) with single-dish data from the IRAM30m observatory, we mapped large spatial scales (~81pc^2) at high angular resolution (7.0''x2.6'' corresponding ~2.3x10^4au or ~0.1pc) down to core scales. The spectral setup in the 3mm band covers many spectral lines as well as the continuum emission. Results: The data reveal the proposed west-east converging gas flow in all observed dense gas tracers. We estimate a mass-flow rate along that flow around 10^-3M_sun/yr. Comparing these west-east flow rates to infall rates toward sources along the line of sight, the gas flow rates are roughly a factor of 25 greater than than those along the line of sight. This confirms the dominance of longitudinal motions along the converging gas flow in G28.37. For comparison, in the main north-south IRDC formed by the west-east converging gas flow, infall rates along the line of sight are about an order of magnitude greater than those along the west-east flow. In addition to the kinematic analysis, a comparison of CH_3CN-derived gas temperatures with Herschel-derived dust temperatures typically show higher gas temperatures toward high-density sources. We discuss whether mechanical heating from the conversion of the flow's kinetic energy into thermal energy may explain some of the observed temperature differences. Conclusions: The differences between flow rates along the converging flow, perpendicular to it, and toward the sources at the IRDC center indicate that at the interfaces of converging gas flows - where most of the active star formation takes place - originally more directed gas flows can convert into multidirectional infall motions."}

This poses a serious problem in the interpretation of both observations and numerical simulations. In this paper, we use filtering operators in real space to separate bulk motion from turbulence at different scales. We show how filters can be used to define consistent kinetic and magnetic energies for the bulk and turbulent component. We apply our GPU-accelerated filtering pipeline to a simulation of a major galaxy cluster merger, which is part of the PICO-Clusters suite of zoom-in cosmological simulations of massive clusters using the moving mesh code Arepo and the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model. We find that during the merger the turbulent pressure fraction on physical scales $\\lesssim$160 kpc reaches a maximum of 5%, before decreasing to 2% after $\\sim$1.3 Gyr from the core passage. These low values are consistent with recent observations of clusters with XRISM, and suggest that unless a cluster was recently perturbed by a major merger, turbulence levels are low. We then re-examine the popular multiscale iterative filter method. In our tests, we find that its use can introduce artifacts, and that it does not reliably disentangle fluctuations living on widely separated length scales. Rather, we believe it is more fruitful to use fixed-scale filters and turbulent energies to compare between simulations and observations. This work significantly improves our understanding of turbulence generation by major mergers in galaxy clusters, which can be probed by XRISM and next-generation X-ray telescopes, allowing us to connect high-resolution cosmological simulations to observations."}

In this work, we systematically investigate the parameter-estimation biases induced by neglecting orbital eccentricity when analyzing eccentric compact-binary coalescences with quasi-circular waveform templates. Focusing on the deci-Hertz detector B-DECIGO and the milli-Hertz detector LISA, we model eccentric inspiral signals using a frequency-domain waveform that incorporates eccentricity-induced higher harmonics and the time-dependent response of spaceborne detectors. We quantify systematic biases in the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, and luminosity distance using both Bayesian inference and the Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri (FCV) formalism, and assess their significance relative to statistical uncertainties. By constructing mock gravitational-wave catalogs spanning stellar-mass and massive black-hole binaries, we identify critical initial eccentricities at which systematic errors become comparable to statistical errors. We find that for B-DECIGO, even very small eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ at 0.1 Hz, can lead to significant biases, whereas for LISA such effects typically arise at larger eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ at $10^{-4}$ Hz, due to the smaller number of in-band cycles. Comparisons between FCV predictions and full Bayesian analyses demonstrate good agreement within the regime where waveform mismatches remain small, especially when extrinsic parameters are pre-aligned to minimize mismatches. Our results highlight the necessity of incorporating eccentricity in waveform models for future space-based gravitational-wave observations."}

We show that in the outer disk (radii $R \\gtrsim 0.01\\,$pc or $\\gtrsim 1000\\,R_{G}$), models supported by thermal or radiation pressure predict disk masses which are much larger than the BH mass and increase with radius - i.e. rapidly-rising, extremely non-Keplerian rotation curves. More generally, we show that any observational upper limit to the deviation from Keplerian potentials at these radii directly constrains the physical form of the pressure in disks. We then show that existing maser and broad line region (BLR) kinematic observations immediately rule out the classic thermal-pressure-dominated Shakura Sunyaev-like $α$-disk model, and indeed rule out any thermal or radiation (or cosmic-ray) pressure-dominated disk, as the required temperatures and luminosities of the gas at large radii would exceed those observed by orders of magnitude. We show that models where the pressure comes entirely from turbulence (without thermal, radiation, or magnetic sources) could in principle be viable but would require turbulent Toomre $Q \\gtrsim 100$, far larger than predicted by self gravitating/gravito-turbulent models. However, recently proposed models of magnetic pressure-dominated disks agree with all of the observational constraints. These magnetically-dominated models also appear to agree better with constraints on maser magnetic fields, compared to the other possibilities. Observations appear to strongly favor the hypothesis that the outer regions of BH accretion disks are in the 'hyper-magnetized' state."}

We compute the duty cycle for a realistic population of PBH binaries, isolating the shot-noise, popcorn and continuous contributions to the GWB.

We investigate the constraining power of galaxy scaling relations on cosmological, astrophysical, and WDM parameters through a joint analysis of hydrodynamic simulations and observational data. Our study is based on the DREAMS project and combines large-volume uniform-box simulations with high-resolution Milky Way zoom-in runs in a $Λ$WDM cosmology. To ensure consistency between the different simulation sets, we apply calibrations to account for resolution effects, allowing us to exploit the complementary strengths of the two suites. We compare simulated relations, including stellar size, DM mass and fraction within the stellar half-mass radius, and the total-to-stellar mass ratio, with two complementary galaxy samples: the SPARC catalog of nearby spirals and the LVDB catalog of dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume. Using a bootstrap-based fitting procedure, we show that key cosmological parameters ($Ω_m$, $σ_8$) and supernova feedback strength can be recovered with good accuracy, particularly from the uniform-box simulations. While the WDM particle mass remains unconstrained, the zoom-in simulations reveal subtle WDM-induced trends at low stellar masses in both the DM mass and total-to-stellar mass ratio. We also find that the galaxy stellar mass function exhibits a measurable dependence on the WDM particle mass below log10(M_*/Msun) <~ 8, which appears separable from the impact of feedback, suggesting it as a promising complementary probe. Our results highlight the importance of combining multi-resolution simulations with diverse observational datasets to jointly constrain baryonic processes and DM properties."}

We also quantify the effects of SED broadening from ensembles of these dominant parameters, finding that the level of tension with observations is strongly phase dependent: Molecular Cloud (MC) is fully consistent, Dark Cloud (DC) shows minor deviations, and HII regions exhibit significant offsets in peak frequency. This points to possible issues in phase-dependent AME extraction, interstellar medium (ISM) environment identification, or underlying theoretical tension.

We take into account dynamical friction, stellar scattering, and gravitational wave emission and compare to the observed relation between core mass deficit and galaxy stellar mass. We find that to match observations, binary hardening in the stellar scattering regime must be about 1.6 times faster than N-body experiments suggest. Most importantly we find that, even assuming a full loss-cone, hardening by stellar scattering alone is insufficient to explain the low frequency turnover seen in the gravitational wave background. This strongly suggests that gas-dynamics play an important role in hardening and provides a reason to be optimistic about electromagnetically visible binary AGN."}

We construct a Bayesian forward model to connect the dark matter halo population predicted by $Λ$CDM with an observed sample of disc galaxies (SPARC) through their maximum rotation velocities. Our approach combines a subhalo abundance matching scheme (accounting for assembly bias) with a parameterised halo response to galaxy formation. When assuming no correlation between selection in the SPARC survey and halo properties, reproducing the observed velocities requires strong halo expansion, low abundance matching scatter ($<0.15$ dex at $1σ$) and a halo proxy that strongly suppresses the stellar masses in satellite haloes. This is in clear tension with independent clustering constraints. Allowing for SPARC-like galaxies to preferentially populate low $\\Vmax$ haloes at fixed virial mass greatly improves the goodness-of-fit and resolves these tensions: the preferred halo response shifts to mild contraction, the abundance matching scatter increases to $\\sint = 0.19^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$ dex and the proxy becomes consistent with clustering.

It represents a key phase of matter in the baryon cycle involving accretion, feedback, outflows, and gas recycling. Redshifted $21$ cm line emission originating from galaxies serves as a key tracer for investigating HI gas and its dynamics in the interstellar medium (ISM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM), and enables the study of galaxy evolution. Nonetheless, direct detections of HI are currently limited to $z \\leq 0.4$ due to the inherently weak $21$ cm emission line. Ongoing and upcoming large radio surveys aim to detect $21$ cm emission from galaxies up to $z \\gtrsim 1$ with unprecedented sensitivity. In current work, we present a novel approach for creating optical-HI joint mock catalogs for upcoming SKA precursor surveys: MIGHTEE-HI and LADUMA with MeerKAT and WALLABY with ASKAP. Incorporation of optical properties along with HI in our mock catalogs makes these a powerful tool for making predictions for upcoming surveys and provides a benchmark for exploring the HI science (e.g., conditional HIMF and optical-to-HI scaling relations) expected from these surveys. As a case study, we show the use of the joint catalogs for predicting the expected outcome of stacking detection for average HI mass in galaxies that are below the threshold for direct detection. We show that combining stacking observations with the number of direct detections puts a strong constraint on the HI mass function, especially in the regime where the number of direct detections is small, as often happens near the farther edge of HI surveys. This intermediate step may be used to set priors for the full determination of the HI mass function."}

We show that in the outer disk (radii $R \\gtrsim 0.01\\,$pc or $\\gtrsim 1000\\,R_{G}$), models supported by thermal or radiation pressure predict disk masses which are much larger than the BH mass and increase with radius - i.e. rapidly-rising, extremely non-Keplerian rotation curves. More generally, we show that any observational upper limit to the deviation from Keplerian potentials at these radii directly constrains the physical form of the pressure in disks. We then show that existing maser and broad line region (BLR) kinematic observations immediately rule out the classic thermal-pressure-dominated Shakura Sunyaev-like $α$-disk model, and indeed rule out any thermal or radiation (or cosmic-ray) pressure-dominated disk, as the required temperatures and luminosities of the gas at large radii would exceed those observed by orders of magnitude. We show that models where the pressure comes entirely from turbulence (without thermal, radiation, or magnetic sources) could in principle be viable but would require turbulent Toomre $Q \\gtrsim 100$, far larger than predicted by self gravitating/gravito-turbulent models. However, recently proposed models of magnetic pressure-dominated disks agree with all of the observational constraints. These magnetically-dominated models also appear to agree better with constraints on maser magnetic fields, compared to the other possibilities. Observations appear to strongly favor the hypothesis that the outer regions of BH accretion disks are in the 'hyper-magnetized' state."}

Both models appeared to be viable during the early-time era, but for the late-time evolution the viability conditions are not fulfilled in definite domains in the parameter spaces of these models.

These $F(R)$ gravity models describe the observations with the large advantage over the $Λ$-Cold-Dark-Matter model, not only in $χ^2$ statistics, but also with Akaike and Bayesian information criteria.

Matching haloes to corresponding N-body (dark matter-only) simulations, we find that virial masses decrease owing to the ejection of baryons by feedback. Relative to N-body simulations, halo profiles show an increased dark matter density in the center (due to radiative cooling) and a decrease in density farther out (due to feedback), with both effects being strongest in SIMBA (> 450% increase at r < 0.01 Rvir). The clustering of dark matter strongly responds to changes in baryonic physics, with dark matter power spectra in some simulations from each model showing as much as 20% suppression or increase in power at k ~ 10 h/Mpc relative to N-body simulations. We find that the dark matter back-reaction depends intrinsically on cosmology (Omega_m and sigma_8) at fixed baryonic physics, and varies strongly with the details of the feedback implementation.

Comparing the numerical results from the AbacusSummit of cosmological simulations, we derive a non-parametric model for the redshift asymmetry distribution of void galaxies, which turns out to be almost universally valid for a very broad range of cosmologies including dynamic dark energy models with time-dependent equation of states as well as the $Λ$CDM models with various initial conditions. We discover that the universality of this model breaks down only if the running of scalar spectral index deviates from zero, detecting a consistent trend that a more positive (negative) running yields a lower (higher) redshift asymmetry of voids than the model predictions. Given that non-standard inflations usually predict non-zero runnings of the spectral index and that the redshift asymmetry distribution of voids is a readily observable quantity, we conclude that this new diagnostics will pave another path toward understanding the true mechanism of inflation."}

In this work, we systematically investigate the parameter-estimation biases induced by neglecting orbital eccentricity when analyzing eccentric compact-binary coalescences with quasi-circular waveform templates. Focusing on the deci-Hertz detector B-DECIGO and the milli-Hertz detector LISA, we model eccentric inspiral signals using a frequency-domain waveform that incorporates eccentricity-induced higher harmonics and the time-dependent response of spaceborne detectors. We quantify systematic biases in the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, and luminosity distance using both Bayesian inference and the Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri (FCV) formalism, and assess their significance relative to statistical uncertainties. By constructing mock gravitational-wave catalogs spanning stellar-mass and massive black-hole binaries, we identify critical initial eccentricities at which systematic errors become comparable to statistical errors. We find that for B-DECIGO, even very small eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ at 0.1 Hz, can lead to significant biases, whereas for LISA such effects typically arise at larger eccentricities, $e_0\\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ at $10^{-4}$ Hz, due to the smaller number of in-band cycles. Comparisons between FCV predictions and full Bayesian analyses demonstrate good agreement within the regime where waveform mismatches remain small, especially when extrinsic parameters are pre-aligned to minimize mismatches.

We aim to establish a new framework for dust evolution models, following in 3D the dust size distribution both in time and space, in MHD models describing the formation and evolution of star-disk systems, at low numerical cost. We present our work coupling the COALA dust evolution module into the code RAMSES, performing the first 3D MHD simulation of protostellar collapse including simultaneously polydisperse dust growth modeled by the Smoluchowski equation as well as dust dynamics in the terminal velocity approximation. Ice-coated micron-sized grains can rapidly grow in the envelope and survive by not entering the fragmentation regime. The evolution of the dust size distribution is highly anisotropic due to the turbulent nature of the collapse and the development of favorable locations such as outflow cavity walls, which enhance locally the dust-to-gas ratio. We analyzed the first 3D non-ideal MHD simulations that self-consistently account for the dust dynamics and growth during the protostellar stage. Very early in the lifetime of a young embedded protostar, micron-sized grains can grow, and locally the dust size distribution deviates significantly from the MRN initial shape.

We investigate whether Scalar--Tensor--Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) can provide a consistent explanation for an enhanced large-scale anisotropic dipole without violating existing constraints from early-universe cosmology, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole, galaxy dynamics, weak lensing, or the observed late-time matter power spectrum. The radio number-count dipole probes ultra-large-scale, anisotropic structure and coherent gravitational response, rather than virialized dynamics or linear growth alone. In STVG-MOG, a scale- and time-dependent effective gravitational coupling preserves standard cosmological evolution at early times and on small to intermediate scales, while amplifying gravitational response on gigaparsec scales. This scale-selective enhancement can increase the large-scale structure contribution to the radio dipole without overproducing power on smaller scales. If the observed dipole excess reflects a physical cosmological signal rather than residual systematics, STVG-MOG offers a viable and testable alternative interpretation. It is demonstrated that the radio dipole anomaly provides a novel probe of gravitational physics on the largest observable scales."}

A comprehensive nuclear reaction network was constructed, and all $(p,γ)$ and $(p,α)$ reaction rates were individually varied by a factor of 10 up and down, identifying 13 preliminary key reactions for calcium production. To propagate the reaction rate uncertainties on calcium production, two sets of Monte Carlo simulations were performed for these key reactions: one adopting STARLIB reaction rates and the other incorporating updated rates from recent experimental data and evaluations. Our results show that Monte Carlo simulations using the updated rates show good agreement with the observed calcium abundance of the extremely iron-poor star SMSS J031300.36-670839.3 within the 68% confidence interval predicted by the models. In contrast, the observed calcium abundance lies marginally outside the 68% C.I. when using the STARLIB rates. Spearman rank-order correlation analysis and SHAP values show that the $(p,γ)$ and $(p,α)$ reactions of F18 and F19 exhibit strong coupled effects on calcium production. These reaction-rate uncertainties need to be reduced to constrain the stellar model predictions. Our study provides insights for future nuclear physics experiments aimed at reducing reaction rate uncertainties in the nucleosynthesis of Population III Stars.\n  Additionally, comparisons between 20 solar-mass and 40 solar-mass Population III stellar models confirm that the latter, with updated reaction rates, is more capable of reproducing the observed Ca abundance and [Ca/Mg] ratio."}

In inviscid flows within the stable wavenumber region $k$, no regular eigenmodes exist -- the frequency spectrum $ω$ consists of a continuous set of singular van Kampen modes with real frequencies. Nevertheless, initial perturbations of the total vorticity integrated across the flow decay exponentially, resembling the behavior of an eigenmode with complex eigenfrequency ${\\rm Im}\\,ω<0$ (Landau damping). However, the vorticity itself does not decay but becomes increasingly corrugated across the flow. We demonstrate that accounting for arbitrarily small viscosity transforms this exponentially decaying perturbation into a true eigenmode in which the vorticity preserves its spatial form. We numerically trace the transformation of the vorticity structure of this mode and its disappearance as viscosity approaches zero. We discuss similarities and differences between the behavior of damped perturbations in the transition from inviscid to nearly inviscid flows in hydrodynamics and their behavior in plasma and homogeneous stellar systems during the analogous transition from collisionless to very weakly collisional systems."}

Spatial correlations between thermal dust and ionized carbon emission in Planck HFI and COBE-DIRBE", "categories": ["astro-ph.CO", "astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "9 pages, 6 figures", "summary": "We fit five tracers of thermal dust emission to ten Planck HFI and COBE-DIRBE frequency maps between 353 GHz and 25 THz, aiming to map the relative importance of each physical host environment as a function of frequency and position on the sky. Four of these correspond to classic thermal dust tracers, namely H i (HI4PI), CO (Dame et al. 2001a), Hα (WHAM, Haffner et al. (2003a, 2016)), and dust extinction (Gaia; Edenhofer et al. 2024), while the fifth is ionized carbon (C ii) emission as observed by COBE- FIRAS. We jointly fit these five templates to each frequency channel through standard multi-variate linear regression. At frequencies higher than 1 THz, we find that the dominant tracer is in fact C ii, and above 10 THz this component accounts for almost the entire fitted signal; at frequencies below 1 THz, its importance is second only to H i. We further find that all five components are well described by a modified blackbody spectral energy density (SED) up to some component-dependent maximum frequency ranging between 1 and 5 THz. In this interpretation, the C ii-correlated component is the hottest among all five, with an effective temperature of about 25 K. The Hα component has a temperature of 18 K, and, unlike the other four, is observed in absorption rather than emission. Despite the simplicity of this model, which relies only on external templates coupled to spatially isotropic SEDs, we find that it captures 98 % of the full signal root mean squared (RMS) below 1 THz. This high efficiency suggests that spatial variations in the thermal dust SED, as for instance reported by Planck and other experiments, may be more economically modelled on large angular scales in terms of a spatial mixing of individually isotropic physical components."}

Towards a concordance model of large-scale thermal dust emission for microwave and infrared frequencies", "categories": ["astro-ph.CO", "astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "11 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "We fit a four-component thermal dust model to COBE-DIRBE data between 3.5 and 240 micron within the global Bayesian end-to- end Cosmoglobe DR2 reanalysis. Following a companion analysis of Planck HFI, the four components of this model correspond to \"hot dust\", \"cold dust\", \"nearby dust\", and \"Halpha correlated dust\", respectively, and each component is modelled in terms of a fixed spatial template and a spatially isotropic spectral energy density (SED) defined by an overall free amplitude for each DIRBE channel. Except for the cold dust amplitude, which is only robustly detected in the 240 micron channel, we measure statistically significant template amplitudes for all components in all DIRBE channels between 12 and 240 micron. In the 3.5 and 4.9 micron channels, only the hot component is detected, while the 1.25 and 2.2 micron channels are too dominated by starlight emission to allow robust dust detections. The total number of DIRBE-specific degrees of freedom in this model is 25. Despite this low dimensionality, the resulting total SED agrees well with recent astrodust predictions. At both low and high frequencies, more than 95 % of the frequency map variance is captured by the model, while at 60 and 100 micron about 70 % of the signal variance is successfully accounted for. The hot dust component, which in a companion paper has been found to correlate strongly with C ii emission, has the highest absolute amplitude in all DIRBE frequency channels; in particular, at 3.5 micron, which is known to be dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, this component accounts for at least 80 % of the total signal. This analysis represents an important step towards establishing a joint concordance model of thermal dust emission applicable to both the microwave and infrared regimes."}
