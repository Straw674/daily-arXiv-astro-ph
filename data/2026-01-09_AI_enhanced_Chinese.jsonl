We study a series of response models to investigate the formation of specific morphological features in the central 1 kpc region of the gas component in barred spiral galaxies.\n  Aims. We aim to understand how structures, such as nuclear rings and spirals, form by varying the parameters of a general gravitational potential and gas properties. Our goal is to determine how much the shape of these structures is driven by the orbital dynamics of the models compared to the influence of the hydrodynamics of the gas. In particular, we examine the effects of the bar strength, bar shape, pattern speed, and central density, as well as their mutual interdependence.\n  Methods. We modeled the gas flow using hydrodynamical simulations run with the Eulerian RAMSES code. The underlying gravitational potential was a two-dimensional Ferrers bar and the gas was considered to be isothermal. Alongside analyzing the gas response to the imposed gravitational potentials, we carried out orbital studies for all models. This involved assessing the shapes and stability of periodic orbits and analyzing the distribution of regular versus chaotic regions within the systems.\n  Results. The parameters of the gravitational potential alone are insufficient to accurately predict the gas dynamics in a system. The morphology of the gaseous response varies substantially with changes in sound speed, emphasizing the fundamental role of hydrodynamic processes in determining the structure of the gas within the central region. We identify the factors that affect the morphology of nuclear rings and trailing and leading nuclear spirals.

Traditional subtractive manufacturing methods are highly equipment-, energy-, and material-intensive, making additive manufacturing (AM) a more practical and sustainable alternative for extraterrestrial production. Among various AM technologies, selective laser melting (SLM) stands out due to its exceptional versatility, precision, and capability to produce dense metallic parts with complex geometries. However, conventional SLM processes rely heavily on inert argon environments to prevent oxidation and ensure high-quality part formation, conditions that are difficult to reproduce on Mars. This study investigates the feasibility of using carbon dioxide (CO2), which makes up over 95% of the Martian atmosphere, as a potential substitute for argon in SLM. Single-track and two-dimensional 316L stainless steel specimens were fabricated under argon, CO2, and ambient air environments with a wide range of laser parameters to evaluate the influence of atmospheric composition on surface morphology, microstructural cohesion, and oxidation behavior. The results reveal that no single parameter controls the overall part quality; rather, a balance of parameters is essential to maintain thermal equilibrium during fabrication. Although parts produced in CO2 exhibited slightly inferior surface finish, cohesion, and oxidation resistance compared to argon, they performed significantly better than those fabricated in ambient air.

Motivated by the Trans-Planckian problem and potential non-canonical dynamics in the early Universe, we introduce a generalized Sasaki-Mukhanov equation characterized by a time-dependent correction term, parameterized by a coupling constant f. Unlike the standard slow-roll approximation, we derive the exact analytical solutions for the mode functions in terms of Whittaker functions, ensuring a precise treatment of the mode evolution across the horizon. We compute the resulting primordial scalar power spectrum, which exhibits scale-dependent oscillatory modulations and a distinct suppression of power at low multipoles. We numerically implement this modified framework within the Cobaya Bayesian inference engine. Utilizing the latest Planck 2018 temperature and polarization likelihoods combined with high-resolution data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6, we perform a robust Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis. Our results place stringent constraints on the modification parameter, |f| <= 10^-4, at a 95% confidence level. However, we find intriguing hints that the generalized model provides a better fit to the low-l CMB spectrum compared to the standard LambdaCDM model, effectively alleviating the low-quadrupole anomaly without compromising the fit at smaller scales.

From the 143 known PNe of M~33, the photometry of only 13 are present in the J-PLUS catalog, as available on the J-PLUS portal. With the aim of recovering a larger fraction of the M~33 PN population, the software SExtractor is adopted to extract the sources in the J-PLUS images and obtain the photometric data for the PNe known in the literature, performing PSF photometry when possible. With this procedure the photometry of 98 PNe was obtained using H$α$ image as detection image, including the 13 already present in the J-PLUS catalog. Using diagnostic color-color diagrams (DCCDs) based on criteria developed for Milky Way halo PNe, we identified 16 sources with PN-like colors. Cross-match with existing catalogs revealed that most of these candidates are H II regions, though one source remains unidentified. Additionally, analyzing their full width at half maximum, most of them would not be PN candidates. This highlights the method's ability to select emission-line objects but also underscores the challenge of distinguishing PNe from contaminants using photometry alone. The J-PLUS colors of 98 known PNe were analyzed, together with literature information on their radial velocities, resulting in the identification of one possible halo PN.

In the context of Stage-IV surveys, the 3-dimensional clustering of galaxies plays a key role in providing cosmological constraints. In this paper, we conduct a model comparison for the multipole moments of the galaxy 2-point correlation function (2PCF) in redshift space. We test state-of-the-art models, in particular the effective field theory of large-scale structure (EFT), one based on the velocity difference generating function (VDG$_{\\infty}$), and different variants of Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT) models, such as convolutional LPT (CLPT) and its effective-field-theory extension (CLEFT). We analyse the first three even multipoles of the 2PCF in the Flagship 1 simulation, which consists of four snapshots at $z\\in\\{0.9,1.2,1.5,1.8\\}$. We study both template-fitting and full-shape approaches and find that with the template-fitting approach, only the VDG$_{\\infty}$ model is able to reach a minimum fitting scale of $s_{\\rm min}=20\\,h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$ at $z=0.9$ without biasing the recovered parameters. Indeed, the EFT model becomes inaccurate already at $s_{\\rm min}=30\\,h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$. Conversely, in the full-shape analysis, the CLEFT and VDG$_{\\infty}$ models perform similarly well, but only the CLEFT model can reach $s_{\\rm min}=20\\,h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$ while the VDG$_{\\infty}$ model is unbiased down to $s_{\\rm min}=25\\,h^{-1}\\,{\\rm Mpc}$ at the lowest redshift.

However, previous works show that AI models trained on data from one simulator fail to generalize to data from another, raising doubts about AI models' ability to accurately infer parameters from observation. We develop a new strategy for training AI models on cosmological simulations based on the principle that increasing the diversity of the training dataset improves model robustness by averaging out spurious and contradictory information. We train AI models on data from different combinations of four simulators, then compare the models' performance when predicting on data from held-out simulators acting as proxies for the real universe. We find that models trained on data from multiple simulators perform better on data from a held-out simulator than models trained on data from a single simulator, indicating that increasing the diversity of the training dataset improves a model's ability to generalize.

This study serves as a pilot for future applications across the full CMZ. We estimated the line-of-sight position of the clouds by analysing stellar kinematics, stellar densities, and stellar populations towards the cloud regions and a control field. We find an absence of westward moving stars in the cloud regions, which indicates that they lie on the near side of the CMZ. This interpretation is supported by the stellar density distributions. The similar behaviour observed in the two clouds, as well as in the region between them (the ridge), suggests that they are located at comparable distances and are physically linked. We also identified an intermediate-age stellar population (2-7 Gyr) in both regions, consistent with that observed on the near side of the CMZ. We estimated the line-of-sight distances at which the clouds and the ridge become kinematically detectable (i.e. where the proper motion component parallel to the Galactic plane differs from that of the control field at the 3 sigma level) by converting their measured proper motions parallel to the Galactic plane using a theoretical model of the stellar distribution.

Crucial to this endeavor is obtaining supernova spectra uncontaminated by light from their host galaxies. However, obtaining such spectra is made more difficult by the inherent problem in wide-field slitless spectroscopic surveys: the blending of spectra of close objects. The spectrum of a supernova will blend with the host galaxy, even from regions distant from the supernova on the sky. If not properly removed, this contamination will introduce systematic bias when the supernova spectra are later used to determine intrinsic supernova parameters and to infer the parameters of dark energy. To address this problem we developed an algorithm that makes use of the spectroscopic observations of the host galaxy at all available observatory roll angles to reconstruct a three-dimensional (3d; 2d spatial, 1d spectral) representation of the underlying host galaxy that accurately matches the 2d slitless spectrum of the host galaxy when projected to an arbitrary rotation angle. We call this ``scene reconstruction''. The projection of the reconstructed scene can be subtracted from an observation of a supernova to remove the contamination from the underlying host.

For example one can reproduce exactly the background that gives the best fit to the recent DESI+CMB+DESY5 data, within the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of DE. Although the background evolution is identical, the perturbations differ, leading to modified growth of structures.

In this study we employed the IllustrisTNG50-1 simulation to demonstrate that knowledge of the turbulence in the cosmic baryonic fluid is crucial for correctly understanding both the spatial distribution and the physical origins of the missing baryons in the Universe. First, we find that dynamical effects cause the gas to be detained in low-density and intermediate-density regions, resulting in high baryon fractions, and prevent the convergence of the gas in high-density regions, leading to low baryon fractions. Second, turbulent energy is converted into thermal energy, and the injection and dissipation of turbulent energy have essentially reached a balance from $z=1$ to $0$. This indicates that the cosmic fluid is in a steady state within this redshift range. Due to turbulent heating, as the redshift decreases, an increasing amount of warm gas is heated and converted into the WHIM, and some even into hot gas. We find that, compared with turbulence in the cosmic fluid, shocks are unimportant in intermediate-density regions and even negligible in high-density regions, both dynamically and thermodynamically. This finding accounts for the origin of the WHIM in terms of both dynamics and thermodynamics, calls into question the traditional view of shock-heating, and highlights the importance of turbulence in shaping the large-scale structure of the Universe, particularly in the evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.

Proper interpretation of atmospheric observations requires a full understanding of the radiation environment that a planet is exposed to.

Our spectra cover 980--1570 Å, providing the broadest FUV wavelength coverage taken in a single exposure and spanning several key stellar emission features which are important photochemical drivers. Combining the SISTINE spectrum with archival observations, model spectra, and a novel stellar activity model, we have created spectral energy distributions (SEDs) spanning 5 Å--1 mm for both $α$ Centauri A and B.

We find that a pair of active galactic nucleus (AGN) jets drive forward shocks in the circumgalactic medium, and after evolving for ~0.95 Myr, the shock-delineated bubble pair roughly matches the observed Circinus bubbles in size and morphology. Our mock X-ray image and spectrum reproduce the observed edge-brightened X-ray surface brightness distribution and spectrum quite well, and suggest that non-thermal emissions from the jet ejecta also contribute substantially to radio and X-ray emissions from the inner \"hotspot\" region. We further show that AGN winds tend to produce more spherical bubbles with a wider base near the galactic plane, inconsistent with observations. The hotspot emissions and the misalignment between the galaxy rotational axis and the bubble's axis argue against a starburst wind origin.

The HADES code was developed to model such systems by coupling hydrodynamics with M1-gray or M1-multigroup radiative transfer models, which are well suited to optically intermediate media.\n  Despite its accuracy, radiation hydrodynamics simulations remain extremely demanding in terms of computational cost. Two main limitations are responsible for this. First, the M1-multigroup model relies on a closure relation with no analytic expression, requiring expensive numerical evaluations. Second, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition strongly restricts the time step of the explicit schemes used in HADES. To overcome these difficulties, two complementary Artificial Intelligence based strategies were developed in this thesis.\n  The first approach consists in training a Multi-Layer Perceptron to approximate the M1-multigroup closure relation. This method achieves excellent accuracy while reducing the computational cost by a factor of 3000, making it the most efficient approach currently available for this task. This performance gain enables high-fidelity simulations of radiative shocks, in which radiation directly influences the shock structure. In particular, increasing spectral resolution slows down the shock and enlarges the radiative precursor.\n  The second approach explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to directly solve the radiation hydrodynamics equations and extrapolate simulations beyond their initial time range.

However, the reliability of most semi-analytic TDE models assume full stellar disruption, despite theoretical expectations that partial disruptions dominate the TDE population. In this work we test the robustness of current TDE models using three repeating partial TDEs (rpTDEs), in which the multiple flares produced by the same surviving stellar core must yield consistent black hole masses. We present spectroscopic observations establishing AT 2023adr as a rpTDE, making it the third such spectroscopically confirmed event.

In particular, we highlight the occurrence of a big rip for fractional values of the Lévy's index in the allowed range $1<α\\leq2$. Moreover, we conclude that the occurrence of a pseudo-rip requires Lévy's index to be $α>2$. Therefore, we reject the possibility of pseudo-rip within the GO cutoff.

However, the universality of PL relations is still debated; particularly, the metallicity effect on the Cepheid PL relation. Due to the HIF-stellar photosphere interactions in Cepheids, different period-color (PC) relations at different phases can influence the corresponding PL relations at those phases.We have considered the PL relations at multiple pulsation phases as they capture the ensemble radiation hydrodynamic properties at those phases. We investigate the effect of metallicity on PL relations based on multiphase analysis of classical Cepheid light curves in the MW, Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Multiphase metallicity coefficients $(γ)$ are derived in five different photometric bands ($V$, $I$, $G$, $G_{\\rm BP}$, $G_{\\rm RP}$) and two Wesenheit indices ($W_{VI}$, $W_{G}$). We show that the coefficients of multiphase period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations vary dynamically as functions of Cepheid pulsation phases over a complete pulsation cycle.

Although this mechanism generates baryon number efficiently only after the quark-hadron transition, by incorporating a realistic stochastic PMF within a semi-analytical framework, we find that matching the observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry robustly requires PMF strengths of order $10^{10}$ T right after the transition, in agreement with causal QCD-era magnetogenesis. We further reveal that magnetic fluctuations drive the baryon-density spectrum to white noise on large scales, yielding an isocurvature component compatible with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) bounds. This establishes a predictive link between the braneworld baryogenesis model and realistic early-Universe magnetic fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "研究发现原初磁场（PMF）在膜世界重子产生模型中起关键作用，其强度需达10^10 T才能解释观测到的重子-反重子不对称性，且磁场涨落导致大尺度上重子密度谱呈白噪声，与宇宙微波背景（CMB）等曲率扰动限制一致。", "background": "研究探讨了原初磁场（PMF）在膜世界重子生成（braneworld baryogenesis）机制中的关键作用及其与早期宇宙磁场的预测性关联。", "data": "data：研究采用半解析框架整合了真实的随机原初磁场（PMF）数据，其强度在夸克-强子相变后约为10^10 T，并与因果性QCD-era磁生成机制一致。", "method": "采用半解析框架结合随机原初磁场（PMF）分析，研究了膜世界重子生成模型中磁场对重子-反重子不对称性的决定性影响。", "result": "原初磁场（PMF）强度在夸克-强子相变后需达到约10^10 T才能与观测到的重子-反重子不对称性匹配。"}}

The degree of alignment increases with (i) decreasing outer separation, (ii) decreasing ratio of outer and inner separations, (iii) decreasing mass of the inner primary component, and (iv) increasing inner mass ratio. There is no dependence on the outer mass ratio. The average mutual inclination is ~40deg for the full sample and ~10deg for 38 triples with primary components less massive than 1 solar and outer separations below 50 au. Inner eccentricities in aligned triples are smaller compared to misaligned ones. In another sample of 371 hierarchies with known outer orbits and inner eclipsing subsystems, only 22% show mutual alignment within 20deg, while the rest are aligned randomly.

These problems are usually `fixed' by postulating the existence of a scalar field (called the ``inflaton''). However, other less ad hoc options are possible. In the running vacuum model (RVM) framework, the vacuum energy density (VED) is a function of the Hubble rate $H$ and its time derivatives: $ρ_{\\rm vac}=ρ_{\\rm vac}(H, \\dot{H},\\ddot{H},\\dots)$. In this context, the VED is dynamical (there is no rigid cosmological constant $Λ$). In the FLRW epoch, $ρ_{\\rm vac}$ evolves very slowly with expansion, as befits the observed $Λ\\simeq$const. behavior. In contrast, in the very early universe the vacuum fluctuations induce higher powers $H^N$ capable of unleashing fast inflation in a short period in which $H\\simeq$ const. We call this mechanism `RVM-inflation'. It does not require an inflaton field since inflation is brought about by pure quantum field theory (QFT) effects on the dynamical background. It is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant. In this work, we study a closely related scenario: the decay of the exact de Sitter vacuum into FLRW spacetime in its radiation epoch and the subsequent impact on the current universe, and compare with the RVM. We find that in both cases inflation is driven by $H^4$ powers together with subleading contributions of order $H^2$ that ease a graceful-exit transition into the radiation-dominated epoch, where the FLRW regime starts and ultimately develops a mildly evolving VED in the late universe: $δρ_{\\rm vac}\\sim {\\cal O}(m_{\\rm Pl} ^2 H^2)$. The outcome is an unified QFT approach to inflation and dark energy (conceived as dynamical vacuum energy) with potentially measurable phenomenological consequences in the present universe which can help to cure the cosmological tensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "这篇论文提出在运行真空模型（RVM）框架下，早期宇宙通过量子场论（QFT）效应驱动的动态真空能量密度（VED）产生暴胀（RVM-inflation），无需引入暴胀子（inflaton）场，并统一解释了暴胀和暗能量（作为动态真空能量）现象，其预测的当前宇宙可观测效应可能缓解宇宙学张力问题。", "background": "研究探讨了暴胀（inflation）作为解决标准宇宙学模型基本不一致性的必要机制，并提出了基于动态真空能量密度（VED）的运行真空模型（RVM）框架作为无需引入暴胀子（inflaton）的替代方案。", "data": "研究采用理论模拟（simulation）方法，基于量子场论（QFT）框架下的动态真空能量密度（VED）模型，通过引入哈勃参数（H）及其时间导数构建演化方程，模拟早期宇宙暴胀（RVM-inflation）和后期辐射主导时期的真空衰变过程。", "method": "采用运行真空模型(RVM)框架，将真空能量密度(VED)表达为哈勃率(H)及其时间导数的函数ρvac=ρvac(H, ̇H, ̈H,...)，通过量子场论(QFT)效应在早期宇宙产生H^4主导的暴胀机制。", "result": "在运行真空模型（RVM）框架下，早期宇宙中真空能量密度（VED）通过高阶项H^4驱动暴胀，无需引入暴胀子场（inflaton），并平滑过渡到辐射主导时期，最终在晚期宇宙形成缓慢演化的VED。"}}
