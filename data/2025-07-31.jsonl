However, computational constraints still severely limit\ntheir numerical resolution. This not only restricts the sampling of the stellar\ncomponent and its direct comparison to detailed observations, but also the\nprecision with which it is evolved. To overcome these problems we introduce the\n\\emph{Superstars} method. This method increases the stellar mass resolution in\ncosmological galaxy simulations in a computationally inexpensive way for a\nfixed dark matter and gas resolution without altering any global properties of\nthe simulated galaxies. We demonstrate the \\emph{Superstars} method for a Milky\nWay-like galaxy of the Auriga project, improving the stellar mass resolution by\nfactors of $8$ and $64$. We show and quantify that this improves the sampling\nof the stellar population in the disc and halo without changing the properties\nof the central galaxy or its satellites, unlike simulations that change the\nresolution of all components (gas, dark matter, stars). Moreover, the better\nstellar mass resolution reduces numerical heating of the stellar disc in its\noutskirts and keeps substructures in the stellar disc and inner halo more\ncoherent. It also makes lower mass and lower surface brightness structures in\nthe stellar halo more visible. The \\emph{Superstars} method is straightforward\nto incorporate in any cosmological galaxy simulation that does not resolve\nindividual stars."}

We also construct 3D and 1D radial velocity profiles to\nidentify coherent expansion trends, and compare stellar proper motions to\nplane-of-sky magnetic field orientations in Taurus and Perseus. We find that\nthe VSFs are mildly anisotropic, with slightly different amplitudes, slopes, or\nfeatures in different directions in several groups, but in general, they are\nall consistent with Larson's Relation at intermediate length scales, especially\nin less compact groups. In several cases, the VSFs exhibit features suggestive\nof local energy injection from supernovae.

While previous studies lean on\nobservation, phase-space, and action-space based criteria for stream and shell\ndetermination, we introduce AstroLink's ordered-density plot and cluster\nidentification as a viable tool for classification. For a given data set, the\nAstroLink ordered-density plot reveals the density-based hierarchical\nclustering structure from which the resultant clusters are identified as being\nstatistically significant overdensities. Using simulations of sub-halo\ndisruptions in an external potential to generate samples of tidal structures,\nwe find that the curvature of the ordered-density plot is positive for\nstream-like structures and negative for shell-like structures. Comparisons with\nmore standard classification techniques reveal strong agreement on which\nstructures typically fit into stream-like and shell-like categories.\nFurthermore, we investigate the properties of clustered stream and shell\nsamples in radial phase space and energy-angle space. Given the sensitivity of\nstellar tidal structures to their host dark matter halos, the identification\nand subsequent classification of these structures provide exciting avenues of\ninvestigation in galactic evolution dynamics and dark matter structure\nformation."}

Two challenges in understanding the mechanisms driving\nspirals are how galactic environment impacts spiral morphology and how they\nevolve over time. We present a catalog characterizing the properties, dynamics,\nand evolution of m=2 spiral structure in 10 Milky Way-mass galaxies from the\nFIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations. Consistent with previous literature,\nwe find that FIRE-2 spirals are transient, recurring features simultaneously\npresent in the disc at varying pattern speeds ($\\Omega_p$) that broadly\ndecrease with radius. These spirals persist on Gyr timescales (mean duration\n1.90 Gyr), but fluctuate in amplitude on timescales of hundreds of Myr. Tidal\ninteractions and bar episodes impact the resulting m=2 spiral structure; strong\nsatellite interactions generally produce shorter-lived, stronger spirals with\nlarger radial extent, and bars can increase $\\Omega_p$. Galactic environment\ninfluences spiral structure; kinematically colder discs can support\nlonger-lived, stronger spirals. The properties of identified spirals in FIRE-2\nvary widely in radial extent (0.3-10.8 kpc), duration (1.00-6.00 Gyr), and\namplitudes ($a_{2,\\text{max}}$=0.018-0.192).

We derive the\nconditions under which OMBHs can form, focusing on key parameters such as halo\nmass, redshift, and halo spin parameter. Our results show that at redshift $z =\n10$, a halo with mass $10^{11}~M_{\\odot}$ and a spin parameter of $0.02$ can\nform a black hole of $1.4 \\times 10^{8}~M_{\\odot}$ through GC migration and\naccretion via tidal disruption events (TDEs).

Field theory simulations predict the successive\ncollapse of increasingly larger domains, which could potentially leave\nobservable imprints in present-day large-scale structures. We use the\nparameter-free velocity-dependent one-scale model to provide an estimate of the\nfinal decay energy of these walls and their associated collapse rate, as a\nfunction of redshift. The energy released by collapsing walls can act as a seed\nfor density perturbations in the background matter field, influencing structure\nformation. We estimate the dependence of the current mass of the resulting\nnon-linear objects on the collapse redshift and wall tension, showing that\ndomain walls can contribute to the formation of objects as massive as\npresent-day galaxy clusters. Still, we confirm that the contribution of\nstandard domain walls to structure formation is subdominant. In contrast,\nbiased domain walls generally face much less stringent constraints on their\ntension, which allows for significantly higher collapse energies.

SO emission is found to be concentrated in rings at the\ncentrifugal barriers of the infalling envelopes. These rings are projected onto\nthe plane of the sky as ellipses or parallel slabs, depending on the\ninclination angles. Spiral-like streamers with SO emission are also common,\nwith warm ($T_{\\rm ex} > 50$ K) and even hot ($T_{\\rm ex} \\gtrsim 100$ K) spots\nor segments of SO$_2$ observed near the centrifugal barriers. Inspired by these\nfindings, we present a model that consistently explains the accretion shock\ntraced by SO and SO$_2$, where the shock occurs primarily in two regions: (1)\nthe centrifugal barriers, and (2) the surface of the disk-like inner envelope\noutside the centrifugal barrier. The outer envelope gains angular momentum\nthrough outflows, causing it to fall onto the midplane at or outside the\ncentrifugal barrier, leading to a disk-like inner envelope that is\npressure-confined by the accretion shock and moves in a rotating-and-infalling\nmotion. We classify the streamers into two types--those in the midplane and\nthose off the midplane. These streamers interact with the inner envelopes in\ndifferent ways, resulting in different patterns of shocked regions. We suggest\nthat the shock-related chemistry at the surfaces of the disk and the disk-like\ninner envelope warrants further special attention."}

The analysis of the nebular\nemission features is performed to probe ejecta asymmetries.
