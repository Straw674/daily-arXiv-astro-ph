The physical origin of these ''extended velocity features'' (EVFs) is\nstill debated, although a connection with the ''dust lanes'' of the Galactic\nbar has been hypothesised. In this paper, we search for analogous features in\nthe dust lanes of nearby barred galaxies using the PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) survey.\nWe aim to confirm existence of EVFs in other galaxies and to take advantage of\nthe external perspective to gain insight into their origin. We study a sample\nof 29 barred galaxies and find that 34% contain one or more EVFs, while the\nremaining lack obvious signs of EVFs. Upon analysing the physical properties of\nthe EVFs, we find they possess large virial parameters, ranging from few\nhundreds to several thousand, indicating that they are strongly\nout-of-equilibrium. The most likely explanation for their origin is extreme\ncloud-cloud collisions with relative velocities in excess of 100km/s in highly\nnon-circular flow driven by the bar. This interpretation is consistent with\nprevious high-resolution observations in Milky Way. Further corroboration of\nthis interpretation comes from the inspection of high-sensitivity infrared\nobservations from the PHANGS-JWST Treasury Survey that reveals streams of gas\nthat appear to be hitting the dust lanes at locations where EVFs are found. We\nargue that EVFs are the clearest examples of cloud-cloud collisions available\nin literature and represent a unique opportunity to study cloud collisions and\ntheir impact on star formation.", "AI": {"tldr": "研究发现银河系内及邻近棒旋星系尘埃带中存在由极端云碰撞产生的宽线分子云特征（EVFs），证实其源于棒结构驱动的高速非圆周运动导致的强非平衡态云碰撞。", "background": "研究银河系内区具有极端宽线特征的分子云（EVFs）及其与星系棒尘埃通道的关联。", "data": "数据来源于PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1)巡天和PHANGS-JWST Treasury Survey的高灵敏度红外观测。", "method": "利用PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1)巡天数据结合高灵敏度红外观测分析尘埃带中分子云的动力学特性及云-云碰撞机制。", "result": "在银河系和其他棒旋星系中发现的扩展速度特征（EVFs）源于棒结构驱动的高度非圆周流中相对速度超过100km/s的极端云-云碰撞。"}}

In accreting white dwarfs (AWDs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN),\nradiation pressure on spectral lines is a promising wind-driving mechanism.\nHowever, the efficiency of line driving is extremely sensitive to the\nionization state of the flow, making it difficult to construct a reliable\nphysical picture of these winds. Recently, we presented the first\nradiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations for AWDs that incorporated detailed,\nmulti-dimensional ionization calculations via fully frequency-dependent\nradiative transfer, using the Sirocco code coupled to PLUTO. These simulations\nproduced much weaker line-driven winds (Mdot_wind / Mdot_acc < 1e-5 for our\nadopted parameters) than earlier studies using more approximate treatments of\nionization and radiative transfer (which yielded Mdot_wind / Mdot_acc ~ 1e-4).\nOne remaining limitation of our work was the assumption of an isothermal\noutflow. Here, we relax this by adopting an ideal gas equation of state and\nexplicitly solving for the multi-dimensional temperature structure of the flow.\nIn the AWD setting, accounting for the thermal state of the wind does not\nchange the overall conclusions drawn from the isothermal approximation. Our new\nsimulations confirm the line-driving efficiency problem: the predicted outflows\nare too highly ionized, meaning they neither create optimal driving conditions\nnor reproduce the observed ultraviolet wind signatures. Possible solutions\ninclude wind clumping on sub-grid scales, a softer-than-expected spectral\nenergy distribution, or additional driving mechanisms.
