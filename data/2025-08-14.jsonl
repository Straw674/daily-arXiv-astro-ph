In\ncontrast with AdS, these dimensions are not manifestly real. This implies that\nthe theoretical constraints on the associated correlators are less transparent,\nparticularly in the presence of light scalars.

However, these ground-based efforts are\nfundamentally limited by Earth's ionosphere, which blocks the low-frequency\nsignals (<10 MHz) expected from terrestrial and Neptune-like exoplanets. In\nthis white paper, we outline a strategy to overcome this barrier by utilizing\nthe unique environment of the Moon.

However, finding adequate statistical\nrepresentations of light curves is challenging because of data quality issues\nsuch as sparsity of observations, irregular sampling, and other nuisance\nfactors inherent in astronomical data collection. The wide diversity of objects\nthat a large-scale survey will observe also means that making parametric\nassumptions about the shape of light curves is problematic. We present a\nGaussian process (GP) regression approach for characterising light curve\nvariability that addresses these challenges. Our approach makes no assumptions\nabout the shape of a light curve and, therefore, is general enough to detect a\nrange of variable source types. In particular, we propose using the joint\ndistribution of GP amplitude hyperparameters to distinguish variable and\ntransient candidates from nominally stable ones and apply this approach to 6394\nradio light curves from the ThunderKAT survey.

We investigate the application of ML in\nspectral type classification on low-resolution (R $\\sim$ 120) near-infrared\nspectra of M0--T9 dwarfs obtained with the SpeX instrument on the NASA Infrared\nTelescope Facility. We specifically aim to classify the gravity- and\nmetallicity-dependent subclasses for late-type dwarfs. We used binned fluxes as\ninput features and compared the efficacy of spectral type estimators built\nusing Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor\n(KNN) models. We tested the influence of different normalizations and analyzed\nthe relative importance of different spectral regions for surface gravity and\nmetallicity subclass classification. Our best-performing model (using KNN)\nclassifies 95.5 $\\pm$ 0.6% of sources to within $\\pm$1 SpT, and assigns surface\ngravity and metallicity subclasses with 89.5 $\\pm$ 0.9% accuracy. We test the\ndependence of signal-to-noise ratio on classification accuracy and find sources\nwith SNR $\\gtrsim$ 60 have $\\gtrsim$ 95% accuracy. We also find that zy-band\nplays the most prominent role in the RF model, with FeH and TiO having the\nhighest feature importance."}

The metallicity and C/O are key diagnostics, allowing to\ndistinguish formation location within the disk (e.g., relative to snowlines),\nand mechanism (e.g., core accretion versus gravitational instability). We can\nnow probe the composition of the planet-forming regions of disks, and that in\ngas-giant exoplanets, to scrutinise these theories and diagnostics. So far,\nALMA has revealed that the outer disk regions are typically metal-depleted and\nO-poor, whereas JWST is showing that the inner disk regions around Sun-like\nstars are mostly O-rich. Further, JWST is showing that most transiting\ngas-giant planets are typically metal-enriched and O-rich, consistent with\nformation at/within the water snowline and pollution by icy bodies. There is\nemerging an arguably \"conventional\" picture of gas-giant planet formation for\ntransiting planets, to be confirmed, of course, with future data."}

While Einstein's gravity has traditionally been employed to examine\nneutron stars, recent observational advancements have revealed its limitations\nin accurately describing high-mass astronomical objects-particularly in\npredicting or explaining certain observed neutron star masses. In response,\nthis research seeks to address the limitations of Einstein's gravity in\ncharacterizing high-mass neutron stars by modifying the gravitational action\nand incorporating the Gauss-Bonnet term. This term holds significant dynamical\nrelevance in higher dimensions, particularly within the context of\nfive-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity explored in this study,\nthereby providing a more realistic description of gravitational phenomena under\nextreme conditions. By deriving the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff\nequations for five-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and utilizing the\nAV18 potential, we analyze the profiles of metric functions, density and\npressure, gradients of density and pressure, the anisotropic function and its\ntrace, mass-function and compactness, the mass-radius curve, surface redshift\nfunction, equation of state parameters, and radial and tangential sound speeds.\nAdditionally, stability factors, adiabatic indices, and energy conditions are\nexamined. The results indicate that all conditions are satisfied for specific\nvalues of the coupling constant, confirming the physical stability of the\nmodel. Furthermore, higher dimensions enhance resistance to gravitational\ncollapse, resulting in an increase in the maximum mass predicted by the\nproposed model. Ultimately, calculations show that the modified Buchdahl\ninequality is satisfied as well."}

OH 231.8+4.2 , also known as the Rotten Egg or Calabash nebula is a\nprotoplanetary nebula which is seen in the direction of the open cluster M 46.\nWhile an association of the nebula with the cluster has been suggested in the\npast, this has been never confirmed. Here, we present accurate trigonometric\nparallax and proper motion measurements using VLBI observations of masers in\nthe nebula and Gaia DR3 data for the cluster.\n  Methods. We observed 22 GHz H2O and 43 GHz SiO masers around OH 231.8+4.2\nusing the Very Long Baseline Array at 4 epochs over 1 year. We also calculated\nthe parallax and proper motion of the open star cluster M 46 using Gaia DR3\ndata.\n  Results. Based on astrometric monitoring for 1 year, we measured an annual\nparallax of OH 231.8+4.2 to be 0.65 +\\- 0.01 mas (stat.) +\\- 0.02 mas (syst.),\ncorresponding to a distance of 1.54 +\\- 0.05 kpc. This agrees well with the\nparallax of M 46 from the Gaia DR3 data, which is 0.639 +\\- 0.001 mas (stat.)\n+\\- 0.010 mas (syst.). We re-estimated the luminosity of OH 231.8+4.2 to be 1.4\nx 10^4 L_sol. However, there is a 15 km/s velocity difference between OH\n231.8+4.2 and M 46 which could be caused by a past merger event."}
