Scientific highlights include\nCRISTAL-10, exhibiting an extreme [CII] deficit similar to Arp 220; and\nCRISTAL-13, where feedback from young star-forming clumps likely causes an\noffset between the stellar clumps and the peaks of [CII] emission. CRISTAL\ngalaxies exhibit global [CII]/FIR ratios that decrease with increasing FIR\nluminosity, similar to trends seen in local galaxies but shifted to higher\nluminosities, likely due to their higher molecular gas content. CRISTAL\ngalaxies also span a previously unexplored range of global FIR surface\nbrightness at high-redshift, showing that high-redshift galaxies can have\nelevated [CII]/FIR ratios.

This technique can help detect final remaining\nneutral islands that span more than 20 Mpc lengths. Using the superpixel method\nbuilt to identify physical patterns in noisy image data, we find that the\nneutral island size distribution can be recovered with an accuracy of $\\sim$0.3\ndex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these reconstructed maps are correlated\nwith the galaxy distribution and anti-correlated with the cosmological 21-cm\nsignal from neutral hydrogen in the IGM. Lastly, we find that these\nreconstructed maps are anti-correlated with the patchy optical depth to the\ncosmic microwave background. As such, multiple measurements can be employed for\nconfirmed detection of neutral islands during the end stages.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "background": "Error", "data": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error"}}

In this study, we investigate CR superdiffusion in\nturbulent, partially ionized media using high-resolution 3D two-fluid\nsimulations that treat ions and neutrals separately. We examine the influence\nof neutral-ion decoupling and the associated damping of turbulence on CR\npropagation in both transonic and supersonic conditions. Our simulations\ndemonstrate that neutral-ion decoupling significantly damps velocity, density,\nand magnetic field fluctuations at small scales, producing spectral slopes\nsteeper than those of Kolmogorov and Burgers scaling. We also identify an\nintermediate coupling regime in which neutrals remain partially coupled with\nions, leading to a steepening of kinetic energy spectra in both fluids. Shocks\ncan enhance the neutral-ion coupling, thereby reducing the differences between\nneutral and ion density structures. Moreover, the damping of magnetic field\nfluctuations substantially decreases pitch angle scattering, which increases CR\nparallel mean free paths. As a result, CR perpendicular transport transitions\nbetween two distinct superdiffusive regimes: a scattering-dominated regime with\nperpendicular displacement proportional to $t^{3/4}$, and a scattering-free\nregime dominated by magnetic field line wandering, with perpendicular\ndisplacement scaling as $t^{3/2}$. When the pitch angle is large, the effects\nof magnetic mirroring, naturally arising in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence,\nbecome significant, enhancing the confinement (but not fully trapping) of CRs\nand inducing oscillations in their perpendicular displacement.

Our results confirm that turbulence is crucial in\nredistributing energy and producing the UNM. The turbulent mixing effect\nsmooths the phase diagram, flattens the pressure-density relationship, and\nincreases the fraction of gas in the UNM. We find that magnetic fields not only\ncontribute to sustaining the UNM but also influence the dynamics and\ndistribution of gas across all phases. Magnetic fields introduce anisotropy to\nthe turbulent cascade, reducing the efficiency of turbulent mixing in the\ndirection perpendicular to the magnetic field. We find the anisotropy results\nin a less flat phase diagram compared to hydrodynamical cases. Furthermore, the\ninclusion of magnetic fields shallowens the second-order velocity structure\nfunctions across multiple ISM phases, suggesting that more small-scale\nfluctuations are driven.

We present simulations of a massive young star cluster using\n\\textsc{Nbody6++GPU} and \\textsc{MOCCA}. The cluster is initially more compact\nthan previously published models, with one million stars, a total mass of $5.86\n\\times 10^5~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, and a half-mass radius of $0.1~\\mathrm{pc}$.\n  Aims. We analyse the formation and growth of a very massive star (VMS)\nthrough successive stellar collisions and investigate the subsequent formation\nof an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a dense star cluster.\n  Methods. We use both direct \\textit{N}-body and Monte Carlo simulations,\nincorporating updated stellar evolution prescriptions (SSE/BSE) tailored to\nmassive stars and VMSs. These include revised treatments of stellar radii,\nrejuvenation, and mass loss during collisions. While the prescriptions\nrepresent reasonable extrapolations into the VMS regime, the internal structure\nand thermal state of VMSs formed through stellar collisions remain uncertain,\nand future work may require further refinement.\n  Results. We find that runaway stellar collisions in the cluster core produce\na VMS exceeding $5 \\times 10^4~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ within 5 Myr, which\nsubsequently collapses into an IMBH.\n  Conclusions. Our model suggests that dense stellar environments may enable\nthe formation of very massive stars and massive black hole seeds through\nrunaway stellar collisions.

We present a novel photoionization model suite that\nsimultaneously incorporates IMBHs and ULXs in a metal-poor, highly star-forming\nenvironment. We account for changes in $M_{BH}$ according to formation seeding\nchannels and metallicity, and changes in ULX populations with post-starburst\nage and metallicity. We find that broadband X-rays and UV emission lines are\ninsensitive to $M_{BH}$ and largely unable to distinguish between ULXs and\nIMBHs.

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "Stars form from molecular gas under complex conditions influenced by multiple\ncompeting physical mechanisms, such as gravity, turbulence, and magnetic\nfields. However, accurately identifying the fraction of gas actively involved\nin star formation remains challenging. Using dust continuum observations from\nthe Herschel Space Observatory, we derived column density maps and their\nassociated probability distribution functions (N-PDFs). Assuming the power-law\ncomponent in the N-PDFs corresponds to gravitationally bound (and thus\nstar-forming) gas, we analyzed a diverse sample of molecular clouds spanning a\nwide range of mass and turbulence conditions. This sample included 21 molecular\nclouds from the solar neighborhood ($d<$500 pc) and 16 high-mass star-forming\nmolecular clouds. For these two groups, we employed the counts of young stellar\nobjects (YSOs) and mid-/far-infrared luminosities as proxies for star formation\nrates (SFR), respectively. Both groups revealed a tight linear correlation\nbetween the mass of gravitationally bound gas and the SFR, suggesting a\nuniversally constant star formation efficiency in the gravitationally bound gas\nphase. The star-forming gas mass derived from threshold column densities\n($N_{{\\mbox {threshold}}}$) varies from cloud to cloud and is widely\ndistributed over the range of $\\sim$1--17$\\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ based on\nN-PDF analysis.

Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "One of the most profound empirical laws of star formation is the Gao-Solomon\nrelation, a linear correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and the\ndense molecular gas mass. It is puzzling how the complicated physics in\nstar-formation results in this surprisingly simple proportionality. Using\narchival Herschel and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\nObservations, we derived the masses of the most massive cores ($M^{\\rm\nmax}_{\\rm core}$) and masses of the gravitationally bound gas ($ M_{\\rm\ngas}^{\\rm bound}$) in the parent molecular clouds for a sample of low-mass and\nhigh-mass star-forming regions. We discovered a significant correlation\n$\\log(M^{\\rm max}_{\\rm core}/M_{\\odot}) = 0.506 \\log(M_{\\rm gas}^{\\rm\nbound}/M_{\\odot})-0.32$. Our discovered $M^{\\rm max}_{\\rm core}$-$M_{\\rm\ngas}^{\\rm bound}$ correlation can be approximately converted to the Gao-Solomon\nrelation if there is (1) a constant 30% efficiency of converting $M^{\\rm\nmax}_{\\rm core}$ to the mass of the most massive star ($m^{\\rm max}_{\\rm\nstar}$), and (2) if SFR and $m^{\\rm max}_{\\rm star}$ are tightly related\nthrough $\\log({\\rm SFR}/(M_{\\odot} {\\rm yr}^{-1})) = 2.04 \\log(m^{\\rm max}_{\\rm\nstar}/M_{\\odot})-5.80$. Intriguingly, both requirements have been suggested by\nprevious theoretical studies (c.f. Yan et al. 2017). Based on this result, we\nhypothesize that the Gao-Solomon relation is a consequence of combining the\nfollowing three non-trivial relations (i) SFR vs. $m^{\\rm max}_{\\rm star}$,\n(ii) $m^{\\rm max}_{\\rm star}$ vs. $M^{\\rm max}_{\\rm core}$, and (iii) $M^{\\rm\nmax}_{\\rm core}$ vs. $M_{\\rm gas}^{\\rm bound}$.

Energy and\nmomentum transport from large-scale fields and flows to small scale motions of\nplasma particles is ubiquitous in these systems, but a full picture of the\nunderlying physical mechanisms remains elusive. The transfer is often mediated\nby a turbulent cascade of Alfv{\\'e}nic fluctuations as well as a variety of\nkinetic instabilities; these processes tend to be multi-scale and/or\nmulti-dimensional, which makes them difficult to study using spacecraft\nmissions and numerical simulations alone (Dorfman et al. 2023; Lichko et al.\n2020, 2023).

The presence of broad Balmer emission lines indicates active\ngalactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes (BHs), while LRDs exhibit\nunusually weak X-ray and radio emission and low variability, suggesting\nsuper-Eddington accretion that obscures the central engine. We suggest that\nsuch an extreme accretion disc inevitably drives strong outflows, which would\ndisrupt the LRDs themselves unless confined within the nuclear region -- posing\na general feedback problem for overmassive BHs. To resolve this, we propose\nthat the BH is embedded in a massive, optically thick envelope that\ngravitationally confines the outflow, making any outflow a no-go. This\nenvelope, powered by accretion on to the BH, radiates at nearly the Eddington\nlimit, and is sustained by an infall of the interstellar medium at a rate on\nthe order of $\\sim 1 M_{\\odot}~{\\rm yr}^{-1}$. A photosphere emerges either\nwithin the envelope or in the infalling medium, with a characteristic\ntemperature of $5000$ - $7000 {\\rm K}$, near the Hayashi limit.
