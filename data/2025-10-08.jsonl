AGN are fuelled by the inward transport of\nmaterial through these structures and can launch multi-phase outflows that\ninfluence the host galaxy through AGN feedback. Aims: We use the Circinus\nGalaxy as a nearby laboratory to investigate the physical mechanisms\nresponsible for feeding the torus and launching a multi-phase outflow in this\nSeyfert-type AGN, as these mechanisms remain poorly understood. Methods: We\nanalysed observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array of\nthe Circinus nucleus at angular resolutions down to 13 mas (0.25 pc). We traced\ndust and the ionised outflow using 86-665 GHz continuum emission, and studied\nthe morphology and kinematics of the molecular gas. Results: We find that the\nCircinus CND hosts molecular and dusty spiral arms, two of which connect\ndirectly to the torus. We detect inward mass transport along these structures\nand argue that the non-axisymmetric potential generated by these arms is the\nmechanism responsible for fuelling the torus. We estimate a feeding rate of\n0.3-7.5 M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, implying that over 88% of the inflowing material\nis expelled in a multi-phase outflow before reaching the accretion disk. The\ninferred torus feeding time scale (120 kyr - 2.7 Myr) suggests that variability\nin AGN activity may be driven by changes in torus feeding. On parsec scales,\nthe ionised outflow is traced by optically thin free-free emission. The outflow\nis stratified, with a slightly wider opening angle in the molecular phase than\nin the dusty and ionised components. The ionised outflow is launched or\ncollimated by a warped accretion disk at a radius of r ~ 0.16 pc, and its\ngeometry requires an anisotropic launching mechanism."}

Submitted to AAS Journals. Comments\n  welcome", "summary": "Disk galaxies like the Milky Way are expected to experience gas flows\ncarrying matter toward their centers. This paper investigates the role of these\nradial gas flows in models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We follow five\ndifferent parameterizations of the Galactocentric radial velocity, $v_{r,g}$,\nof the interstellar medium (ISM). Relative to the $v_{r,g}=0$ limit, all models\npredict stellar metallicity to decline less significantly with age in the outer\ndisk and more significantly in the inner disk. This outcome arises because\nradial flows cannot remove gas from one region of the Galaxy without placing it\nelsewhere, leading to opposing effects on enrichment timescales between the\ninner and outer Galaxy. This prediction is at odds with recent observational\nconstraints, which indicate remarkably minimal decline in metallicity\n($\\lesssim$$0.1$ dex) between young ($\\sim$$0-2$ Gyr) and old populations\n($\\sim$$8-10$ Gyr) across the \\textit{entire} Galactic disk. Radial gas flows\ncannot be the sole explanation of this result at all Galactocentric radii.

In\nagreement with previous GCE models, all of our flow prescriptions lead to lower\nmetallicities and steeper radial gradients relative to static models.\nExploiting this universal outcome, we identify mixing effects and the relative\nrates of star formation and metal-poor accretion as the processes that\nestablish the ISM metallicity at low redshift. We provide a suite of analytic\nformulae describing radial metallicity gradient evolution based on this\nconnection."}

Many approved\nprograms take advantage of its highly stable point spread function (PSF) to\ndirectly detect faint companions using diverse high-contrast imaging (HCI)\ntechniques.

Many\nprograms utilize observations of a reference star to remove the stellar\ncontribution within an image which can typically take half of the total\nallocated time. We present a high-contrast imaging technique for the NIRISS\ninstrument that uses the measured wavefront error (WFE) from a phase\ncalibration observation (performed roughly every 48 hours) as prior information\nin a Bayesian analysis with nested sampling. This technique estimates the WFE\nof a given observation and simultaneously searches for faint companions,\nwithout using a reference star. We estimate the wavefront error for both full\naperture and aperture masking interferometry (AMI) imaging modes using three\nlow order Zernike coefficients per mirror segment, using the Hexike basis, to\ngenerate synthetic PSFs and compare to simulations.

The SIDM model leads to a 25%\nreduction in stellar mass and retains more gas within the stellar half-mass\nradius due to a prolonged quiescent phase in star formation. The stellar\ndistribution is less centrally concentrated, and a population of in-situ star\nclusters form at late times. Substructure analysis reveals fewer luminous\nsatellites and more stellar-only systems in SIDM, driven in part by tidal\nstripping that affects the dark matter more than the stars. A subset of\nsatellites undergoes tidal-triggered core collapse after infall, enhancing the\ndiversity of SIDM satellite rotation curves.

It is now possible to directly\nmeasure the apparent drift of high-redshift astronomical sources across the sky\n$\\textit{in real time}$. This so-called $\\textit{position drift}$ provides a\nvaluable probe of the peculiar velocity field and cosmic structure formation by\ngiving direct access to the transverse velocity that is otherwise currently not\nmeasurable and must be statistically reconstructed from the density field in a\nmodel-dependent way. To fully exploit this new window into the Universe, it is\nessential to understand how cosmological structures affect position drift\nmeasurements. Here we present the first position drift study based on the\ngeneral relativistic N-body simulation code $\\texttt{gevolution}$. We calculate\nthe position drift directly from the past light cone for ten different\nobservers and compare the results to predictions from linear perturbation\ntheory. At linear order, the position drift is directly proportional to the\ntransverse velocity on the sky. This linear approximation reproduces our\nnon-linear simulation results to within about 5%. We calculate power spectra\nfor the position drift, splitting the signal into an E- and B-mode and compare\nthe former to linear expectations, finding good agreement. The B-mode is\nsuppressed on linear scales, but has similar amplitude as the E-mode on\nnon-linear scales. We further demonstrate that light-cone inhomogeneities\ninduce biases in the dipole of the drift, introducing redshift dependence of\nboth the amplitude and direction. Although our analysis is not yet sufficient\nfor a firm conclusion, our results suggest that these effects alone cannot\nexplain the possible redshift-dependent dipole in Gaia DR3 data reported in the\nliterature."}

In this\nintroductory work, we present an overview of the physical characteristics of\nhigh-redshift MEGATRON galaxies and their environment at $z>8$. We present a\nlibrary of $>175,000$ simulated galaxy spectra and demonstrate how the\ndiversity of galaxy spectra seen by JWST is naturally reproduced in the context\nof a $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This project represents a step towards making more\ndirect comparisons between simulations and observations and will enable future\nwork to both optimize methods for inferring galaxy properties from observations\nand to elucidate the physics that governs galaxy formation in the early\nUniverse."}

These estimates can be used to investigate the link between observed\nActive Galactic Nuclei (AGN) emission properties and the underlying accretion\nphysics of their Super-Massive Black Holes (SMBHs). However, while optical and\ncore radio emission trace the ongoing accretion episode, extended jet and lobe\nstructures may result from past AGN activity. Therefore, accretion rates\ninferred from spatially unresolved radio observations may be systematically\noverestimated, a bias whose prevalence and extent have yet to be thoroughly\nexplored.

We aim to investigate the distribution and sizes of charged\nPAHs across the key zones of the Orion Bar PDR. We employ JWST MIRI-MRS\nobservations of the Orion Bar from the Early Release Science program\n''PDRs4All'' and synthetic images in the JWST MIRI filters. We investigate the\nspatial morphology of the AIBs at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.0 $\\mu$m that commonly\ntrace PAH cations, and the neutral PAH-tracing 11.2 $\\mu$m AIB, their\n(relative) correlations, and the relationship with existing empirical\nprescriptions for AIBs. The 6.2. 7.7, 8.6, 11.0, and 11.2 $\\mu$m AIBs are\nsimilar in spatial morphology, on larger scales. Analyzing three-feature\nintensity correlations, two distinct groups emerge: the 8.6 and 11.0 $\\mu$m vs.\nthe 6.2 and 7.7 $\\mu$m AIBs. We attribute these correlations to PAH size. The\n6.2 and 7.7 $\\mu$m AIBs trace cationic, medium-sized PAHs. Quantum chemical\ncalculations reveal that the 8.6 $\\mu$m AIB is carried by large, compact,\ncationic PAHs, and the 11.0 $\\mu$m AIB's correlation to it implies, so is this\nband. The 6.2/8.6 and 7.7/8.6 PAH band ratios thus probe PAH size. We conclude\nthat the 6.2/11.2 AIB ratio is the most reliable proxy for charged PAHs, within\nthe cohort. We outline JWST MIRI imaging prescriptions that serve as effective\ntracers of the PAH ionization fraction as traced. This study showcases the\nefficacy of the 6-9 $\\mu$m AIBs to probe the charge state and size distribution\nof the emitting PAHs, offering insights into the physical conditions of their\nhost environments. JWST MIRI photometry offers a viable alternative to IFU\nspectroscopy for characterizing this emission in extended objects."}

Due to their complexity and non-linear nature, it can be\nchallenging to understand their decision-making process. While these models can\neffectively identify unusual spectra, interpreting the physical nature of the\nflagged outliers remains a major challenge. We aim to bridge the gap between\nanomaly detection and physical understanding by combining deep learning with\ninterpretable ML (iML) techniques to identify and explain anomalous galaxy\nspectra from SDSS data. We present a flexible framework that uses a variational\nautoencoder to compute multiple anomaly scores, including physically-motivated\nvariants of the mean squared error. We adapt the iML LIME algorithm to\nspectroscopic data, systematically explore segmentation and perturbation\nstrategies, and compute explanation weights that identify the features most\nresponsible for each detection. To uncover population-level trends, we\nnormalize the LIME weights and apply clustering to the top 1\\% most anomalous\nspectra. Our approach successfully separates instrumental artifacts from\nphysically meaningful outliers and groups anomalous spectra into\nastrophysically coherent categories. These include dusty, metal-rich\nstarbursts; chemically-enriched H\\,II regions with moderate excitation; and\nextreme emission-line galaxies with low metallicity and hard ionizing spectra.\nThe explanation weights align with established emission-line diagnostics,\nenabling a physically-grounded taxonomy of spectroscopic anomalies. Our work\nshows that interpretable anomaly detection provides a scalable, transparent,\nand physically meaningful approach to exploring large spectroscopic datasets.\nOur framework opens the door for incorporating interpretability tools into\nquality control, follow-up targeting, and discovery pipelines in current and\nfuture surveys."}

These sources offer the opportunity to investigate the\nmicrophysics of the ICM and its interplay with radio galaxies, the origin of\nseed relativistic electrons, the merging history of the host cluster, and the\nphenomenology of radio filaments. The study of revived sources has so far been\nhampered by the requirement of sensitive and high-resolution multi-frequency\nradio data at low frequencies to characterise their spatial properties and\nprovide a proper classification.

By combining LOFAR and uGMRT data, we\nobtained high-resolution images and spectral index maps, which we used to\ninterpret the nature of the sources. All targets show regions with very steep\nspectra, confirming the effectiveness of our morphology-based selection in\nidentifying fossil plasma. Based on their morphology, spectral properties, and\noptical associations, we investigated the origin of the targets.

It is now possible to directly\nmeasure the apparent drift of high-redshift astronomical sources across the sky\n$\\textit{in real time}$. This so-called $\\textit{position drift}$ provides a\nvaluable probe of the peculiar velocity field and cosmic structure formation by\ngiving direct access to the transverse velocity that is otherwise currently not\nmeasurable and must be statistically reconstructed from the density field in a\nmodel-dependent way. To fully exploit this new window into the Universe, it is\nessential to understand how cosmological structures affect position drift\nmeasurements. Here we present the first position drift study based on the\ngeneral relativistic N-body simulation code $\\texttt{gevolution}$. We calculate\nthe position drift directly from the past light cone for ten different\nobservers and compare the results to predictions from linear perturbation\ntheory. At linear order, the position drift is directly proportional to the\ntransverse velocity on the sky. This linear approximation reproduces our\nnon-linear simulation results to within about 5%. We calculate power spectra\nfor the position drift, splitting the signal into an E- and B-mode and compare\nthe former to linear expectations, finding good agreement. The B-mode is\nsuppressed on linear scales, but has similar amplitude as the E-mode on\nnon-linear scales. We further demonstrate that light-cone inhomogeneities\ninduce biases in the dipole of the drift, introducing redshift dependence of\nboth the amplitude and direction. Although our analysis is not yet sufficient\nfor a firm conclusion, our results suggest that these effects alone cannot\nexplain the possible redshift-dependent dipole in Gaia DR3 data reported in the\nliterature."}
