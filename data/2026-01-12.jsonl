We also developed a ballistic toy model of the gas ejected laterally from a jet to interpret the data.\n  $Results.$ In agreement with previous observations, the ALMA data show that the slow outflow component is distributed in two opposed conical lobes and has a shear-flow pattern with velocity increasing toward the axis. The EHV gas consists of a series of arc-like condensations that span the full width of the conical lobes and merge with their walls, suggesting that the fast and slow outflow components are physically connected. In addition, position--velocity diagrams along the outflow axis show finger-like extensions that connect the EHV emission with the origin of the diagram, as if part of the EHV gas had been decelerated by its interaction with the low-velocity outflow. A ballistic model can reproduce these finger-like extensions assuming that the EHV gas consists of jet material that has been ejected laterally over a short period of time and has transferred part of its momentum to the surrounding shear flow.\n  $Conclusions.$ The EHV gas in the IRAS 04166 outflow seems to play a role in the acceleration of the slower gas component. The presence of similar finger-like extensions in the position-velocity diagrams of other outflows suggests that this process may be occurring in other systems, even if the EHV component is not seen because it has an atomic composition."}

This region offers a unique laboratory to study the physics of feedback and the nature of multiphase winds in detail. To this end, we have developed physically motivated semi-analytical models of a multiphase outflow consisting of a hot gas phase ($T \\gg 10^6$ K) that embeds colder clouds ($T \\sim 5000$ K). Our models include the gravitational potential of the Milky Way; the drag force exerted by the hot phase onto the cold clouds; and the exchange of mass, momentum, and energy between gas phases. Using Bayesian inference, we compared the predictions of our models with observations of a population of HI high-velocity clouds detected up to $\\sim$1.5 kpc above the Galactic plane near the Galactic center. We find that a class of supernova-driven winds launched by star formation in the central molecular zone can successfully reproduce the observed velocities, spatial distribution, and masses of the clouds. In our two-phase models, the mass and energy loading factors of both phases are consistent with recent theoretical expectations. The cold clouds are accelerated by the hot wind via ram pressure drag and via accretion of high-velocity material, resulting from the turbulent mixing and subsequent cooling. However, this interaction also leads to gradual cloud disruption, with smaller clouds losing over 70\\% of their initial mass by the time they reach $\\sim$2 kpc."}

While star-forming galaxies are widely regarded as the primary drivers of this process, the extent to which active galactic nuclei (AGNs) contribute remains a subject of ongoing investigation. In this study, we integrate a physically motivated AGN spectral energy distribution (SED) model with state-of-the-art observations to reassess the contribution of AGNs to cosmic reionization. Our findings indicate that adopting a more sophisticated AGN SED model could substantially increase the predicted ionizing photon output by a factor of 3$\\sim$4, elevating AGNs to a more significant role ($\\approx$20\\%) in maintaining reionization than previously estimated. The inclusion of abundant faint AGNs further amplifies this contribution by a factor of a few. These conclusions remain robust across a wide range of accretion rates and ionizing photon escape fractions.

We identify 55 baryon-dominated clusters forming outside galactic discs but within the virial radius of the primary halo. Star formation in these systems proceeds rapidly, reaching peak stellar surface densities above $10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$, closely matching the compact clusters recently discovered by JWST in the lensed Cosmic Gems Arc at $z \\approx 9.6$. Such extreme densities are a key pre-requisite to trigger runaway stellar collisions, indicating that a subset of our clusters would be a likely host of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). We find that massive star clusters can form efficiently in the circumgalactic medium at early times through filament fragmentation, whereby high gas densities lead to rapid local collapse via a combination of thermal and gravitational instabilities. This formation pathway implies that some compact clusters formed in the quiet outskirts of forming galaxies rather than within their discs. Small variations in filament properties, including metallicity, density, and dark-matter content, influence the likelihood of a star cluster being able to form an IMBH seed. The formation of clusters in circumgalactic environments points to a potential evolutionary pathway connecting early off-disc clusters, present-day globular clusters, and the seeds of massive BHs."}

These signatures represent unique probes of spacetime that are inaccessible to standard Newtonian analyses but increasingly important as survey volumes grow.

Here we investigate the N-PDFs of Cygnus-X using the column density map obtained from Herschel, supplemented by HI and Young Stellar Objects (YSO) data. We find that the N-PDFs of Cygnus-X and four sub-regions display log-normal + power-law shapes, indicating the combined effects of turbulence and gravity in sculpting the density structure. We find evidence that the power-law segment of the N-PDFs flattens over time, and the transitional column density can be seen as a unique and stable star formation threshold specific to each molecular cloud. These results not only clarify the physical state of Cygnus-X but also emphasize the utility of the N-PDF as a statistical diagnostic tool, as it is an accessible indicator of evolutionary stages and star formation thresholds in molecular clouds."}

NAGGS can be used with open source molecular dynamics codes, allowing for the modelling of grains that have different chemical compositions and are grown under a range of astrophysical conditions. To demonstrate how NAGGS works, we use it to produce 40 nanosilicate grain models with diameters of approx. 3.5 nm and consisting of approx. 1500 atoms. We consider Mg-rich olivinic and pyroxenic grains, and growth under two circumstellar dust-producing conditions. We calculate properties from the atomistically detailed nanograin structures (e.g. morphology, surface area, density, dipole moments) with respect to the size, chemical composition, and growth temperature of the grains. Our simulations reveal detailed new insights into the complex interacting degrees of freedom during grain growth and how they affect the resultant physicochemical properties. For example, we find that surface roughness depends on the Mg:Si ratio during growth.We also find that nanosilicates have very high dipole moments, which depend on the growth temperature. Such findings could have important consequences (e.g. astrochemistry, microwave emission). In summary, our bottom-up physically motivated approach offers a detailed understanding of nanograins that could help in both interpreting observations and improving dust models."}

We show that the signal-to-noise ratio of KL at such high redshifts is on average twice as much that expected from current weak lensing (WL) surveys such as Euclid or LSST, and several times that of the previous generation of WL surveys like DES and KiDS, even with very conservative assumptions about the fraction of spectroscopically-detected sources for which KL shear estimates will be available.

Here, we build upon earlier studies by employing Bayesian modelling to investigate the kinematics of the combined inner and outer GC populations of M31. Given the heterogeneous nature of the data, we examine subpopulations defined by GCs' metallicity and by associations with substructure, in order to characterise possible relationships between the inner and outer GC populations. We find that lower-metallicity GCs and those linked to substructures exhibit a common, more rapid rotation, whose alignment is distinct from that of higher-metallicity and non-substructure GCs. Furthermore, the higher-metallicity GCs rotate in alignment with Andromeda's stellar disk. These pronounced kinematic differences reinforce the idea that different subgroups of GCs were accreted to M31 at distinct epochs, shedding light on the complex assembly history of the galaxy."}

However, due to limitations in calibration methods and the limited availability and underuse of high-precision reference data, existing photometric standard stars may suffer from insufficient numbers, systematic errors exceeding 10 milli-magnitude (mmag), limited photometric band coverage, or incomplete sky coverage, among other issues. To overcome these limitations, we have constructed the largest (over 200 million stars, 1000 times the widely recognized Landolt standards in the same magnitude range), most precise (better than 10 mmag), and most comprehensive (over 200 bands, nearly 40 times the coverage of traditional standards) all-sky standard stars. Based on standards, we have calibrated multiple survey datasets to mmag precision, and subsequently developed a complete sky distribution of stars for the Pan-STARRS system. This database, the BEst STars Database (BEST), is expected to pave the way for achieving mmag-level - or even higher - photometric precision in large-scale surveys, and to play a central role in shaping a high-precision astronomical measurement framework."}

Assuming azimuthally symmetric noise properties is a common simplifying assumption for such simulations, which neglects the patchy nature of the residual diffracted starlight; i.e., speckles. Fortunately, patchiness might prove to be an opportunity that improves the overall sensitivity of observatory assuming photon-noise limited speckle subtraction. We illustrate this effect in the context of angular differential imaging (ADI), which is one of the possible observing strategies being considered for the detection and characterization of exo-Earth with HWO. We show that combining observations of two observatory roll angles leads to a gain in signal-to-noise greater than $\\sqrt{2}$ when the patchy starlight dominates other noise sources. The gain can be closer to x2 when the starlight dominates the noise budget by more than an order of magnitude. In other words, combining good and bad observations is better than combining two average ones. This statement is very general as it is a direct consequence of combining data with a weighted mean. It applies more broadly to any combination of observations with varying noise level."}

However, the majority of IDE models studied in the literature rely on phenomenological interaction terms proportional to the Hubble parameter (e.g., $Q\\propto Hρ$), which lack a clear microphysical justification and often suffer from large-scale instabilities. In this work, we propose and investigate a \"bottom-up\" IDE model where the interaction is formulated directly from particle physics collision processes, taking the form $Q\\proptoρ^2$. This interaction represents a reversible annihilation/creation process between Dark Matter and Dark Energy, motivated by the Boltzmann equation. We test this model against a combination of background cosmological data, Pantheon Plus, Cosmic Chronometers, DESI DR2, and CMB distance priors from Planck18. We find that the model is consistent with the data, yielding a Hubble constant of $H_0=67.71\\pm0.65$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for the combined analysis. The dimensionless interaction rate coefficients are constrained to be small, with upper limits of $A < 7.586\\times10^{-25}$ (for Dark Matter self annihilation) and $B < 0.048$ (for Dark Energy self annihilation) at 95\\% confidence level. Since the interaction model is parameterized by the expansion rate, these bounds on $H_0$, $A$, and $B$ directly translate into a strict limit on the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section per unit of mass. The constraints on the coupling $A$ imply that, if such a collisional interaction exists, the effective dark-matter annihilation cross section per unit mass is highly suppressed relative to the cosmological expansion rate. In contrast, the corresponding dark-energy contribution, governed by $B$, is only constrained at the level of a few percent in dimensionless units."}

However, the large distance and severe foreground extinction complicate interpretation of infrared ice absorption features tracing chemical and evolutionary properties of these embedded objects. To better characterise YSOs and dense cores in this region, we combined spectra from multiple YSOs, each likely backlit by a giant star, allowing us to probe their outer layers and derive an ensemble-averaged ice abundance profile. We obtained L-band spectra of 15 point-like sources with extremely red colours using Gemini/GNIRS, enabling measurements of the CH3OH absorption feature at 3.535 micron. To better constrain the foreground extinction and H$_2$O ice column densities, we combined these data with K-band and mid-infrared spectra using NASA/IRTF and Spitzer/IRS. We found that the CH$_3$OH abundance in the CH$_3$OH-CO$_2$ ice mixture is 2 to 5 percent, confirming that it is systematically lower than those typically observed in the Galactic disk. Furthermore, by using the local excess of foreground extinction as a proxy for the projected distance between a backlit source and the centre of a YSO, we found that the CH$_3$OH abundance relative to solid CO$_2$ remains near 10 percent in the inner regions of the envelope, but increases sharply to about 30 percent in the outer regions. The relatively low methanol ice abundance may reflect the unique chemical environment of the CMZ. However, our results offer an alternative interpretation: since our sample is biased towards massive and luminous YSOs, intense heating from the central protostar may have caused substantial sublimation of methanol ice in the inner regions of their envelopes, thereby systematically lowering the observed CH$_3$OH/H$_2$O ice ratios."}

The primary objective of this study was to investigate the nature of these distant active galactic nuclei (AGN) and to confirm their blazar nature. Utilizing the technique of VLBI, we obtained high-resolution radio images of compact core and core-jet structures. To confirm the classification of these sources, we collected multi-band archival data, including total radio flux densities from single-dish and low-resolution interferometric surveys, optical astrometric positions from Gaia, and X-ray data. These diagnostics collectively help distinguish between blazars and misaligned jetted AGN. We were able to measure the core brightness temperatures and found that 11 objects show the Doppler-boosted emission expected from blazars. For five additional sources, we do not see evidence of Doppler boosting even if X-ray data suggest that the source is a blazar. These could be either borderline objects or variability may have affected the classifications, considering that VLBI and X-ray data are not simultaneous. Finally, for the two remaining objects the data suggest a non-blazar classification. Our findings confirm that a significant fraction of these high-redshift radio-loud quasars are blazars and mainly characterized by compact core structures. Overall, the VLBI classifcations are consistent with the X-ray classes. This study further increases the sample of VLBI-imaged radio quasars at z > 4 by ~10%, offering valuable on the population of AGN in the early Universe."}

This challenge will require a large survey of nearby, bright stars -- ~100 according to the Astro2020 Decadel Survey. To ensure the success of the mission and to help guide design decisions, the stellar multiplicity of the target stars must be well-understood. To this end, we present optical speckle imaging of stars in the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) provisional HWO star list, which is currently the Tier 1 target list for the HWO Target Stars and Systems Sub-Working Group. We obtained new observations using `Alopeke and Zorro at Gemini Observatory and queried the Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program Archive for archival observations, resulting in speckle imaging data for 80 of the 164 stars. We confirmed one candidate companion detected previously by Gaia (HD 90089) and obtained an ambiguous detection of a known companion (HD 212330). To examine our sensitivity to companions, we simulated stellar companions down to ~0.1 $M_{\\odot}$ for each target and found that 75%-85% would be detected in our speckle images; the remaining simulated companions are either too faint or too close-in, and will require follow-up using other methods such as long-term spectroscopic measurements and space-based techniques. This work represents a first step towards surveying potential HWO targets for close-in stellar companions and helping to inform the target selection process for the HWO direct-imaging survey, bringing us closer towards the discovery of potential habitable worlds."}

Compared to the peak in the correlation function, it is more robust to late-time nonlinear effects at the percent level. In light of improved simulations and high quality data, we revisit the robustness of the linear point and use it as an alternative to template-based fitting approaches typically used in BAO analyses. We present the linear point measurements on galaxy samples from the first and second data releases (DR1 and DR2) of the DESI survey. We convert the linear point into a dimensionless parameter $α_{iso,LP}$, defined as the ratio of the linear point in the fiducial cosmology and the observed value, analogous to the isotropic BAO scaling parameter $α_{iso}$ used in previous BAO measurements. Using the 2nd generation of AbacusSummit mock catalogs, we find that linear point measurements are more precise when calculated in the post-reconstruction regime with 15-60% smaller uncertainties than those pre-reconstruction. We find a systematic shift in the linear point measurements compared against the isotropic BAO measurements in mocks; we attribute this to the isotropic damping parameter responsible for smearing the linear point in the nonlinear regime. We propose a sample-dependent correction that mitigates the impact of late-time nonlinear effects. While this introduces a cosmology dependence in an otherwise model-independent measurement, this is necessary given the sub-percent precision dictated by current cosmological surveys. Comparing $α_{iso,LP}$ with isotropic BAO measurements made on the DESI DR1 and DR2 galaxy samples, we find excellent agreement after applying this correction, particularly post-reconstruction. We discuss future scope regarding cosmological inference with linear point measurements."}

The reaction between CH3 and OH radicals could also conceivably generate methanol at temperatures above approximately 20 K, at which temperature hydrogen atoms will not adhere to the ice surface. However, this process has not been verified by well-controlled experiments. Using a newly-developed Cs+ ion pickup technique, the authors investigated the reaction between CH3 and OH radicals on the surface of amorphous solid water, an ice dust analogue, at temperatures from 10 to 60 K. In the present experiments, OH radicals were generated by UV photolysis of water molecules, following which methane (CH4) gas was deposited on the ice substrate. The results show that CH3OH was formed on the ice surface through the sequential reactions CH4 + OH -> CH3 + H2O and CH3 + OH -> CH3OH even at 10 K. Considering the very low surface coverage of reactants in the experimental condition, the second reaction was found to occur as a result of transient diffusion of CH3 due to the heat of the first reaction."}

Nonlinear interactions are a dominant source of low-frequency noise, mixing noise from multiple degrees of freedom. The lowest-order form is bilinear noise, in which the noise from two feedback-controlled subsystems multiplies to mask gravitational waves. Bilinear couplings require control trade-offs that simultaneously balance high- and low-frequency noise. Currently, there is no known lower limit to bilinear control noise. Here, we develop benchmark cost functions for bilinear noise and associated figures of merit. Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control then establishes aggressive feedback that saturates the lower bounds on the cost functions. We then develop a mixed LQG and $H_\\infty$ approach to directly compute stable, robust, and optimal feedback, using the LIGO's alignment control system as an example. Direct computations are fast while ensuring a global optimum. By calculating optimal robust control, it is possible to construct the lower bound on controls noise along the Pareto front of practical controllers for LIGO. This method can be used to drastically improve controls noise in existing observatories as well as to set subsystem control noise requirements for next-generation detectors with parameterized design."}

White paper submitted to the ESO Expanding Horizons Call on behalf of ET OSB Div2 - Cosmology", "summary": "Over the next two decades, gravitational-wave (GW) observations are expected to evolve from a discovery-driven endeavour into a precision tool for astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. Current second-generation ground-based detectors have established the existence of compact-binary mergers and enabled GW multi-messenger astronomy, but they remain limited in sensitivity, redshift reach, frequency coverage, and duty cycle. These limitations prevent them from addressing many fundamental open questions in cosmology. By the 2040s, wide-field electromagnetic surveys will have mapped the luminous Universe with unprecedented depth and accuracy. Nevertheless, key problems including the nature of dark matter, the physical origin of cosmic acceleration, the properties of gravity on cosmological scales, and the physical conditions of the earliest moments after the Big Bang will remain only partially constrained by electromagnetic observations alone. Progress on these fronts requires access to physical processes and epochs that do not emit light. Gravitational waves provide a unique and complementary observational channel: they propagate over cosmological distances largely unaffected by intervening matter, probe extreme astrophysical environments, and respond directly to the geometry of spacetime. In this context, next-generation GW observatories such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) will be transformative for European astronomy. Operating at sensitivities and frequencies beyond existing detectors, ET will observe binary black holes and neutron stars out to previously inaccessible redshifts, enable continuous high signal-to-noise monitoring of compact sources, and detect gravitational-wave backgrounds of astrophysical and cosmological origin. Together with space-based detectors, ET will play a central role in advancing our understanding of cosmic evolution and fundamental physics."}

Here we examine the accretion disk in the super-Eddington AGN I Zw 1 using reverberation mapping of the optical continuum. We use three years of optical monitoring with Las Cumbres Observatory at sub-day cadence in $uBgVriz_s$. The lag-wavelength spectrum, calculated using the cross correlation method and PyROA, shows a $u$-band excess. PyROA lags are equally well fitted with a thin and slim disk profile. The UV/optical AGN spectral energy distribution is consistent with a thin disk. The disk size at 4495 Å for a thin disk model is $4.23\\pm0.24\\:\\mathrm{ld}$ and for a slim disk model is $1.71\\pm0.09\\:\\mathrm{ld}$, larger by a factor of $2-4$ than the fiducial disk size of $1.07\\pm0.15\\:\\mathrm{ld}$ as determined using the Eddington ratio. We find evidence of different size scales probed with different variability timescales. Lags evaluated at longer variability timescales increase as do frequency-resolved lags at low frequencies, which we interpret as an additional secondary reprocessor at large radii consistent with the broad-line region (BLR) in I Zw 1. The high frequency lags, predicted well with just a disk, are fit with a thin disk profile and a size of $0.61\\pm0.37\\:\\mathrm{ld}$. This indicates that the actual disk size may be on the order of the fiducial size. We also collate the most extensive set of directly measured internal sizes of an AGN, from optical to mid-infrared with reverberation mapping and optical interferometry. Assuming that the disk is indeed the fiducial size, these show little evidence that the accretion disk extends into the BLR significantly, tentatively disfavouring the failed radiatively accelerated dust driven outflow BLR formation model."}

Our analysis of such data on the Vela pulsar, assuming a dominant scattering region in its foreground, suggests that the fractional distance of the scatterer is $0.89 \\pm 0.01$, and for the given distance of the Vela pulsar, it translates to $254 \\pm 16$ pc. Using independent distances of ten pulsars, we suggest a refined description of the Gum Nebula electron density model with its basic morphology similar to that used in the YMW16 model, which now provides better estimates of pulsar distances in these directions. In our new Gum Nebula model, as expected, the Vela pulsar would be behind the frontal edge of the Gum shell, which was intriguingly located in front of the nebula in the YMW16 model. We also present a new technique to better constrain the pulsar distances using their dispersion measure and temporal broadening simultaneously, and find that it is less affected by the uncertainties in the Galactic electron density distribution models. Notably, the new approach shows that the expected temporal broadening as a function of trial distance does not follow a monotonic increasing trend, but instead exhibits oscillations at regions of enhanced electron density. This behaviour is expected, as the method employs the integral form of temporal broadening with the appropriate weighting kernel, leading to more reliable estimates."}

We utilize two state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations NewHorizon and NewCluster, post-processed with the radiative transfer code Skirt, to investigate the systematic uncertainties and biases in the inferred SFRs for z=5 galaxies; an epoch where galaxies build-up their stellar mass. We create synthetic observables for widely-used tracers: Halpha nebular line, [CII] 158 micron fine-structure line, total infrared (IR) continuum luminosity, and hybrid (IR + UV). We find that Halpha-inferred SFRs, time-averaged over 10 Myr, are sensitive to the choice of calibration and exhibit substantial scatter driven by dust attenuation, viewing angle, and dust-to-metal ratio. Adopting a steeper attenuation curve reduces this scatter significantly but does not fully eliminate systematic uncertainties. IR continuum-based SFRs trace intrinsic SFRs time-averaged over 100 Myr timescales when a well-sampled continuum emission between restframe 8 and 1000 micron is available and underestimate them with typical approaches when IR data are limited. Nevertheless, IR SFRs display a considerable scatter, largely due to UV photon leakage and strong variations in the star formation history. When UV data are available, hybrid (IR + UV) SFRs provide a more robust estimate, reducing scatter compared to IR-based SFRs while avoiding explicit attenuation corrections. Finally, we derive a [CII]-SFR relation finding a steeper relation than previous studies, however with significant scatter linked to gas density and metallicity.

Shortly after a star formation episode, however, the NUV is dominated by the same massive stars that power H$α$, so these indicators do not always trace distinct timescales.

Subtracting the predicted O-star NUV from the dust-corrected NUV yields a more reliable rejuvenation diagnostic.

They are rarely detected in HI in clusters, making their dynamical properties difficult to assess. The relation between field and cluster populations is unclear.\n  Aims : Detecting UDGs entering a cluster could give important clues to their evolution, both in terms of their dynamics but also as to whether they are structurally similar - i.e. if cluster UDGs are generally the same as field UDGs except with less gas and an older stellar population.\n  Methods : We use data from two deep Arecibo surveys, the Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey and the Widefield Arecibo Virgo Environment Survey, to measure the gas content of the UDG-candidate VCC 1964. Optical properties are quantified from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and DESI Legacy Surveys.\n  Results : We find a significant 9 kpc offset between the HI and optical components of VCC 1964, no evidence of asymmetry in the HI, and only a modest deficiency level. This suggests a wholesale displacement of the gas content. The line width is 4-5 sigma deviant from the baryonic and over 6 sigma deviant from the optical forms of the Tully-Fisher relation. The optical component is blue and smooth.\n  Conclusions : VCC 1964 is consistent with a UDG experiencing gas displacement due to ram pressure as it enters the cluster for the first time. Intriguingly, its dynamics imply a significant dark matter deficit, however we cannot rule out that this may be due to the gas being displaced out of equilibrium."}

While for some operators the uncertainties are smaller than one order of magnitude for entropically-motivated deviations from the Maxwell-Boltzmann form, for other operators these uncertainties can be as large as three orders of magnitude near threshold. Furthermore, we identify the dependence of the scattering rate for various operators of the effective theory with different velocity-weighted moments of the velocity distribution, functionally analogous to the mean, variance, or skewness. This provides new analytic insight into which features of the velocity distribution are most relevant to detect a given particle dark matter model. Our technique is general and could be applied to a broader class of physics problems where a physical observable depends on the statistical moments of an uncertain theoretical distribution."}

We present a method for identifying rejuvenating galaxies in the local Universe using ultraviolet (UV) imaging and optical spectroscopy, building on a recent selection that identifies a system as rejuvenating if it is quenched in the near-UV (NUV; tracing $\\sim\\!100\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$ timescales) but star-forming in H$α$ (tracing $\\sim\\!10\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$ timescales). Shortly after a star formation episode, however, the NUV is dominated by the same massive stars that power H$α$, so these indicators do not always trace distinct timescales. To address this, we derive a relation that predicts the NUV emission associated with the ionizing O-star population traced by H$α$, enabling us to isolate the NUV contribution from longer-lived stars (primarily B/A stars with $M\\lesssim\\!20\\,M_\\odot$). Subtracting the predicted O-star NUV from the dust-corrected NUV yields a more reliable rejuvenation diagnostic. Using this method, we identify $\\sim\\!10^{4}$ rejuvenating galaxies in a sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies ($\\sim\\!4.5\\%$). These galaxies have intermediate stellar masses and are found primarily in lower-density environments, becoming increasingly rare toward the centers of groups and clusters. Rejuvenating galaxies also exhibit systematically lower gas-phase metallicities, consistent with fueling by the accretion of metal-poor gas."}

While their photometric properties (luminosity and duration) both span an order of magnitude, population studies suggest that these distributions are continuous. However, spectroscopic samples have shown some indications of distinct sub-types, either through similarity to certain prototype objects, or in terms of their velocity evolution. Here we show that a well-observed SLSN, PTF12dam, completely changes its O II absorption profile as it rises to maximum light, moving from one proposed sub-type to another. This supports an interpretation where spectroscopic diversity is driven by the ejecta temperature at maximum light, rather than fundamental differences in the explosion or progenitor. Motivated by this, we develop a new diagnostic, the Brightness-Timescale-Temperature-Radius diagram, and a simple toy model for the evolution of the photospheric velocity, to show that diversity in the light curve rise time (likely due to differences in ejected mass) naturally explains why SLSNe with broader light curves generally have weaker O II lines, lower photospheric velocities after maximum, and slower changes in photospheric velocity over time. We show that the velocity distribution of the known SLSN population favours a relatively flat ejecta density profile, consistent with a hot bubble inflated by a central engine."}

Towards this goal, we have identified a global network of 29 bright (G < 17.5) featureless white dwarf stars that have a spectral energy distribution consistent with an almost pure blackbody form over the entire optical and near-infrared wavelength range.

A common strategy is to divide the domain into several regions (patches) and simplify the equation in each region. When approximate analytic solutions can be obtained in each patch, they are then matched at the interfaces to construct a global solution. However, this patching procedure can fail to reproduce the correct solution, since the approximate forms may break down near the matching boundaries. In this work, we propose a learning framework in which the integration constants of asymptotic analytic solutions are promoted to scale-dependent functions. By constraining these coefficient functions with the original differential equation over the domain, the network learns a globally valid solution that smoothly interpolates between asymptotic regimes, eliminating the need for arbitrary boundary matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in representative problems from chemical kinetics and cosmology, where it accurately reproduces global solutions and outperforms conventional matching procedures."}

NAGGS can be used with open source molecular dynamics codes, allowing for the modelling of grains that have different chemical compositions and are grown under a range of astrophysical conditions. To demonstrate how NAGGS works, we use it to produce 40 nanosilicate grain models with diameters of approx. 3.5 nm and consisting of approx. 1500 atoms. We consider Mg-rich olivinic and pyroxenic grains, and growth under two circumstellar dust-producing conditions. We calculate properties from the atomistically detailed nanograin structures (e.g. morphology, surface area, density, dipole moments) with respect to the size, chemical composition, and growth temperature of the grains. Our simulations reveal detailed new insights into the complex interacting degrees of freedom during grain growth and how they affect the resultant physicochemical properties. For example, we find that surface roughness depends on the Mg:Si ratio during growth.We also find that nanosilicates have very high dipole moments, which depend on the growth temperature. Such findings could have important consequences (e.g. astrochemistry, microwave emission). In summary, our bottom-up physically motivated approach offers a detailed understanding of nanograins that could help in both interpreting observations and improving dust models."}

In our new Gum Nebula model, as expected, the Vela pulsar would be behind the frontal edge of the Gum shell, which was intriguingly located in front of the nebula in the YMW16 model. We also present a new technique to better constrain the pulsar distances using their dispersion measure and temporal broadening simultaneously, and find that it is less affected by the uncertainties in the Galactic electron density distribution models. Notably, the new approach shows that the expected temporal broadening as a function of trial distance does not follow a monotonic increasing trend, but instead exhibits oscillations at regions of enhanced electron density. This behaviour is expected, as the method employs the integral form of temporal broadening with the appropriate weighting kernel, leading to more reliable estimates."}

These dense environments have a significant impact on galaxy evolution, influencing their gas content, morphology, and star formation activity. In this work we analyse in detail the system NGC~5098$/$5096 composed of two galaxy groups. We performed hydrodynamical $N$-body simulations of a galaxy group collision aimed at reproducing the gas sloshing and surface brightness distribution observed in X-ray data. We conducted a detailed X-ray analysis and generated mock image \\textit{Chandra} observations from our simulations. The resulting corrected mock image surface brightness profiles show good agreement with the observed data. The relative line-of-sight velocity between NGC~5098 and NGC~5096 is $v_{\\mathrm{los}} = 700$ km s$^{-1}$, with a projected separation of $d_{\\mathrm{proj}} = 155$ kpc, suggesting that the collision occurs nearly in the line-of-sight. Our simulations were performed with an inclination angle of $80^\\circ$ in order to reproduce the dynamical constraints. We also find a correlation between the dark matter and intragroup light distributions when comparing the residual dark matter map with the intragroup light morphology. Our best-fitting model is consistent with these observational constraints and provides a plausible dynamical scenario for the current state of the NGC~5098 group interaction with NGC 5096."}

Here, we demonstrate that an off-axis minor merger in its early phase $-$ when the infalling subhalo is near its primary apocenter and the stripped tail is not yet mixed with the main cluster atmosphere $-$ can drive intracluster gas motions generally consistent with the XRISM results. These include a pronounced velocity gradient and an approximately uniform velocity dispersion of $\\simeq100-200\\,\\rm{km\\,s^{-1}}$ in the cluster core. Our merger scenario was originally suggested in Lyskova et al. (2019) to reproduce the major X-ray morphological features of Coma. In addition, we introduce a simple and robust diagnostic of intracluster gas motions based on the ratio of the line-of-sight velocity to the velocity dispersion."}

In many cases, a circumbinary disk of gas forms around the binary with an orbit that may be misaligned to the binary plane. Misaligned disks around nearly circular binaries evolve into disks that are either aligned or counteraligned with the binary orbit. However, if the binary is sufficiently eccentric, then it can be more likely that the disk ends up in a polar-aligned configuration in which the disk angular momentum vector aligns with the binary eccentricity vector. We use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations, evolved to an approximate steady state under mass injection, to determine the orbital evolution of a binary with a polar-aligned disk for a range of binary-disk parameters. We find that, in all of the cases we have simulated, the binary shrinks with time. The decay rate is larger than for binaries surrounded by aligned or retrograde disks with matched disk parameters. The rate of shrinkage is largely unaltered by the size of the sink radii employed for the binary stars, but for small enough sink radii some of the models exhibit long-lived polar circumprimary disks, which are continually fed mass from the circumbinary disk. We discuss our results in the contexts of planet formation in young polar-aligned disks and merging supermassive black holes in galaxy centers."}
