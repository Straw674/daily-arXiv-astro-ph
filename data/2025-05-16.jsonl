Based\non broad-line diagnostics, these galaxies have been argued to host accreting\n$10^7-10^8$ M$_\\odot$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a claim with crucial\nconsequences for our understanding of how the first black holes form and grow\nover cosmic time. A key feature of LRDs is their extreme X-ray weakness:\nanalyses of individual and stacked sources have yielded non-detections or only\ntentative, inconclusive X-ray signals, except for a handful of individual\ncases. As the most natural explanation, high obscuration, is disfavored by JWST\nspectroscopic evidence, several authors have suggested that the X-ray weakness\nof LRDs is intrinsic, due to super-Eddington accretion rates. In this work, we\ntest that scenario by stacking X-ray data for 55 LRDs in the Chandra Deep Field\nSouth, accumulating a total exposure time of nearly 400 Ms. Despite reaching\nunprecedented X-ray depths, our stack still yields a non-detection. The\ncorresponding upper limits are deep enough to rule out current super-Eddington\naccretion models, and are compatible only with extremely high levels of\nobscuration ($N_H\\gtrsim10^{25}$~cm$^{-2}$). To explain the X-ray weakness of\nLRDs, we therefore speculate that the SMBHs in these systems are neither as\nmassive nor as luminous as currently believed."}

In this paper, we provide an overview of the literature background and\ndescribe recent breakthroughs, open questions, and connections to other fields.\nThis overview is intended to provide a starting point for researchers who are\nrelatively new to the fields of ultracompact binaries or AM CVn-type binaries.\nWe define the scope of the catalogue (the criteria for inclusion) and describe\nits format and contents (what data have been included for each target). We also\nsummarise the observed properties of the known mass-transferring ultracompact\nbinaries, including their orbital periods and component stellar masses and\nradii. The catalogue presented here aims to provide a central resource to\nenable researchers to track the current status of the known sample. At the time\nof writing, the catalogue includes 123 confirmed binaries and 29 candidates.\nThe catalogue is hosted on a public platform (Zenodo) with version control, and\nwill be updated regularly."}
