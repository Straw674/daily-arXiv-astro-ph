Background: 研究恒星晕中恒星结构的识别方法，特别是结合化学和动力学特征以克服传统动力学方法的局限性。

Data: 数据来源于APOGEE数据集。

Method: 结合孪生神经网络、图神经网络、自编码器和OPTICS算法开发了名为CREEK的集成聚类方法。

Result: 结合化学与动力学信息并通过神经网络系统开发的CREEK方法能有效识别银河系晕中的吸积结构，包括已知恒星流和潜在新结构。

Abstract: The identification of stellar structures in the Galactic halo, including
stellar streams and merger remnants, often relies on the dynamics of their
constituent stars. However, this approach has limitations due to the complex
dynamical interactions between these structures and their environment.
Perturbations such as tidal forces exerted by the Milky Way, the potential
escape of stars, and passages through the Galactic plane can result in the loss
of dynamical coherence of stars in these structures. Consequently, relying
solely on dynamics may be insufficient for detecting such disrupted or
dispersed remnants. We combine chemistry and dynamics, integrated through a
system of neural networks, to develop a clustering method for identifying
accreted structures in the Galactic halo. We developed an integrated approach
combining Siamese neural networks (SNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs),
autoencoders, and the OPTICS algorithm to create a comprehensive procedure
named CREEK. This method is designed to uncover stellar structures in the
Galactic halo. Initially, CREEK was trained on known globular clusters (GCs)
and then applied to the dataset to identify stellar streams. CREEK successfully
recovered 80% of the GCs present in the APOGEE dataset, re-identified several
known stellar streams, and identified a potential new stream. Additionally,
within highly populated stellar structures, CREEK can identify substructures
that exhibit distinct chemical compositions and orbital energies. This approach
provides an objective data-driven method for selecting stars associated with
streams and stellar structures in general.

Moreschini,F. Mannucci,G. Sabatini,F. Salvestrini,M. Scialpi,G. Tozzi,L. Ulivi,G. Venturi,A. Vidal-García,C. Vignali,M. V. Zanchettin*

**TL;DR**: 通过多波段观测和自洽模型分析NGC 1365星系核周区域，首次明确区分了AGN电离与恒星形成活动，揭示了不同电离势气体（低IP示踪盘面、高IP示踪外流）的分布与运动特征，并精确测定了外流物质的性质和动力学参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究聚焦于利用多波段观测数据解析邻近塞弗特星系NGC 1365核周区域气体的多相态结构与活动机制。

Data: 数据来源包括JWST/MIRI、VLT/MUSE和ALMA的空间分辨光谱观测数据。

Method: 结合先进的光电离和运动学模型（HOMERUN+MOKA3D）进行自洽分析。

Result: 发现NGC 1365核周区域存在多相气体结构，其中低电离势气体追踪盘状结构，而高电离势气体标记外流锥，并通过新型自洽模型首次精确约束了活动星系核驱动的外流物理参数。

Abstract: We present a multi-phase study of the gas in the circumnuclear region
(~1.1x1.0 kpc^2) of the nearby Seyfert 1.8 galaxy NGC 1365, observed in the
context of the Mid-IR Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE)
program. We combined spatially resolved spectroscopic observations from
JWST/MIRI, VLT/MUSE, and ALMA to investigate the ionized atomic gas and the
warm and cold molecular phases.
  MIRI data revealed over 40 mid-IR emission lines from ionized and warm
molecular gas. Moment maps show that both cold and warm molecular gas follow
the rotation of the stellar disk along the circumnuclear ring. The ionized gas
displays flux and kinematic patterns that depend on ionization potential (IP):
low-IP species (<25 eV) trace the disk, while higher-IP lines (up to ~120 eV)
trace outflowing material.
  The [O III]5700 and [Ne V]14 lines both trace the southeast nuclear outflow
cone. Additionally, [Ne V]14 detects the northwest counter-cone, obscured in
the optical and thus invisible in [O III]5700. Mid-IR diagnostics, unlike
optical ones, clearly reveal the AGN as the primary ionization source in the
nucleus. Emission from high-IP species is spatially coincident with the
ionization cones and not with star-forming regions.
  Using the [Ne V]24/[Ne V]14 ratio, we derive an electron density of
(750+-440) cm^(-3), in agreement with values from the [S II] optical doublet.
  For the first time, we apply a fully self-consistent approach combining
advanced photoionization and kinematic models (HOMERUN+MOKA3D) to constrain
intrinsic outflow properties, overcoming the limitations of simplified
classical methods. Exploiting the synergy of JWST/MIRI and VLT/MUSE, HOMERUN
reproduces fluxes of over 60 emission lines from optical to mid-IR,
disentangling AGN and star formation contributions and yielding robust
estimates of outflow mass, geometry, and energetics.

*K. Bouvis,S. Akras,H. Monteiro,L. Konstantinou,P. Boumis,J. García-Rojas,D. R. Gonçalves,A. Monreal-Ibero,I. Aleman,K. N. Gourgouliatos*

**TL;DR**: 基于JWST等观测数据对比3D模型与经验方法，发现NGC 3132行星状星云的化学丰度测定存在高达35%的氧丰度差异，并揭示了H2与尘埃的空间关联及新发射线团块。

Background: 研究恒星演化及其对银河系和宇宙过程影响的关键在于质量损失的研究。

Data: 数据来源于MUSE、JWST和Spitzer的高质量空间分辨观测数据。

Method: 基于3D模型结合MUSE、JWST和Spitzer观测数据，对比分析经验法与光致电离模型对NGC 3132物理特性及化学丰度的可靠性。

Result: 传统经验方法和光致电离模型在总物理性质和化学丰度上结果一致，但对复杂电离结构区域的模拟观测中经验方法无法准确恢复模型输入丰度，氧丰度差异可达35%。

Abstract: Central to our understanding of stellar evolution and its impact on processes
in our Galaxy and across the Universe is the study of mass loss. While the
general framework is well established, recent JWST observations of objects like
NGC 3132 have revealed intricate nebular structures, suggesting complex
mass-loss processes likely driven by multiple star system at its core. These
findings pose new challenges for the currently available investigation tools.
The primary goal of this study is the first detailed comparison of the physical
properties and chemical composition obtained for NGC 3132, based on the latest
detailed 3D model and observations from MUSE, JWST and Spitzer. We evaluate the
reliability of the traditional empirical method and photoionization model for
abundances estimations, both based on the same available high-quality,
spatially resolved observations. We find that the model and empirical method
yield consistent results for the integrated total properties such as Te, ne and
chemical abundances. However, when applied to simulated observations from the
model, the empirical method fails to recover the model input abundances,
providing only an approximate estimate. This discrepancy arises in part from
the loss of information when summing fluxes over regions which have complex
ionisation structures. This discrepancy in the case of oxygen has been
estimated to be up to 35%. Moreover, the latest IR data reveal a spatial
correlation between H2, c(Hb) as well as the [8.0]/[4.5] IRAC ratio. Finally,
new clumps are discovered in [Ni II] 7378 \AA, [Fe II] 8617 \AA and [Fe III]
5270 \AA emission lines.

### [4] [Tidal Disruption Event Demographics in Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Over Cosmic Times](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08082)
*Denyz Melchor,Smadar Naoz,Suvi Gezari,Brenna Mockler*

**TL;DR**: 研究发现双超大质量黑洞系统中的潮汐瓦解事件发生率随黑洞质量增加而上升，与单黑洞模型的下降趋势相反，为解释后星暴星系观测现象提供了新机制，并预测了可用于约束双黑洞比例的红移依赖事件率。

Background: 研究探讨了潮汐瓦解事件（TDEs）作为探测超大质量双黑洞（SMBH binaries）及其动力学过程的重要工具。

Data: 数据来源为模拟的双超大质量黑洞系统，考虑了偏心Kozai-Lidov振荡和双体弛豫效应的综合影响。

Method: 采用包含偏心Kozai-Lidov振荡和两体弛豫效应的双超大质量黑洞模拟方法。

Result: 双黑洞系统中的潮汐瓦解事件率随黑洞质量增加而上升，与单黑洞模型的下降趋势相反。

Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) offer a unique probe of supermassive black
hole (SMBH) demographics, but their observed rates remain difficult to
reconcile with standard single-SMBH models. In this work, we use simulations of
SMBH binaries, including the combined effects of eccentric Kozai-Lidov
oscillations and two-body relaxation, to explore how TDE rates scale with SMBH
mass and redshift. We find that binary systems exhibit increasing TDE rates
with mass, in contrast to the declining trend expected for single SMBHs. These
binary-driven rates match those observed in post-starburst galaxies, suggesting
that a subset of TDE hosts may contain SMBH binaries. TDE light curves in some
massive galaxies exhibit unexpectedly short durations, suggesting that the
disrupting SMBH may be less massive than implied by host galaxy scaling
relations, consistent with disruptions by the less massive black hole in a
binary. By convolving our mass-dependent rates with the SMBH mass function, we
predict redshift-dependent TDE rates, which we show can be used to constrain
the supermassive black hole binary fraction. Our results provide a testable
framework for interpreting TDE demographics in upcoming wide-field surveys such
as LSST and Roman.

### [5] [Reverberation Mapping Data of NGC 5548 Imply a Multicomponent Broad-Line Region](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08084)

**TL;DR**: 通过多组分发射模型解释NGC 5548宽线区观测到的单峰谱线和双峰延迟特征，挑战了传统云团或薄盘模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究探讨了活动星系核中宽线区的几何结构和运动学特征，旨在通过观测数据改进现有模型以更准确描述超大质量黑洞周围气体发射机制。

Data: 使用AGN STORM团队在NGC 5548中获得的回响映射数据集。

Method: 采用多组分发射的宽线区模型分析NGC 5548的回响映射数据。

Result: NGC 5548的宽线区发射特征无法用单一云团或薄盘模型解释，需采用多组分发射模型。

Abstract: Line broadening and variability are observational hallmarks of active
galactic nuclei which allow us to measure supermassive black hole masses as
well as constrain the geometry and kinematics of the emitting gas, with the
most precise measurements requiring a degree of modeling. Two popular models of
the broad-line region describe the emitting gas as either a distribution of
puffed up clouds or a thin disk with strong velocity gradients. As we show in
this work, key features in the reverberation mapping dataset obtained by the
AGN STORM team in NGC 5548 cannot be accounted for by either simple model. In
several emission lines the observed broad-line profile has a single peak yet
the delay profile has a distinct double peak, strongly motivating a BLR with
emission from multiple components. We demonstrate a few possibilities that may
alleviate the tension and better represent the true nature of the broad-line
emitting gas in NGC 5548 and beyond.

### [6] [JWST Discovery of Warm Dust in the Circumgalactic Medium of the Makani Galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08098)

**TL;DR**: 在Makani星系中首次探测到多环芳烃（PAHs）延伸至35 kpc的外流区域，证实星系风携带的尘埃可长距离存活但会逐渐侵蚀。

Background: 探测多环芳烃在星系风中的长距离存活及其演化过程。

Data: 数据来源于JWST的NIRCam和MIRI观测，利用PAH光谱特征在3.3、7.7及(11.3 + 12.2)微米波段与MIRI和NIRCam滤光片带通的巧合匹配。

Method: 利用JWST的NIRCam和MIRI观测数据，通过匹配PAHs在3.3、7.7及(11.3+12.2)微米的光谱特征与滤光片波段进行检测分析。

Result: 在Makani星系外流中检测到多环芳烃（PAHs）发射，表明PAHs在恶劣环境中存活并传播至35 kpc的星系晕，但随距离增加逐渐被侵蚀。

Abstract: We report the detection of near- and mid-infrared emission from polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) out to ~ 35 kpc in the Makani Galaxy, a compact
massive galaxy with a record-breaking 100-kpc scale starburst-driven wind at
redshift z = 0.459. The NIRCam and MIRI observations with JWST take advantage
of a coincidental match between the PAH spectral features at 3.3, 7.7, and
(11.3 + 12.2) microns in Makani and the bandpasses of the MIRI and NIRCam
filters. The warm dust is not only detected in the cool-gas tracers of the
galactic wind associated with the more recent (7 Myr) starburst episode, but
also in the outer warm-ionized gas wind produced by the older (0.4 Gyr)
episode. The presence of PAHs in the outer wind indicates that the PAHs have
survived the long (R/v ~ 10^8 yrs) journey to the halo despite the harsh
environment of the galactic wind. The measured F1800W/F1130W flux ratios in the
unresolved nucleus, inner halo (R = 10 - 20 kpc), and outer halo (R = 20 - 35
kpc), tracers of the PAH (11.3 + 12.2)/7.7 ratios, indicate decreasing
starlight intensity incident on the PAHs, decreasing PAH sizes, and increasing
PAH ionization fractions with increasing distance from the nucleus. These data
provide the strongest evidence to date that the ejected dust of galactic winds
survives the long journey to the CGM, but is eroded along the way.

**TL;DR**: 研究发现气体相金属丰度显著影响星际介质性质，降低金属丰度导致恒星形成率下降、冷气体比例减少、暖气体比例增加以及致密区域分子氢比例和结构数量减少。


<details>

Background: 探讨气相金属丰度对恒星形成星系星际介质（ISM）加热冷却过程及大质量恒星特性的影响。

Data: 使用FLASH代码进行磁流体动力学模拟，数据来源于SILCC项目，模拟覆盖1/50 Z⊙到1 Z⊙的金属丰度范围。

Method: 采用磁流体动力学模拟结合非平衡热化学、变紫外背景与宇宙线电离率、金属依赖恒星演化、HII区形成、恒星风、II型超新星及宇宙线注入与传输等多物理过程耦合的FLASH代码进行模拟。

Result: 金属丰度降低导致恒星形成率下降超过十倍，冷气体质量分数从60%降至2.3%，暖气体体积填充率从20%增至80%。

Abstract: The gas-phase metallicity affects heating and cooling processes in the
star-forming galactic interstellar medium (ISM) as well as ionising
luminosities, wind strengths, and lifetimes of massive stars. To investigate
its impact, we conduct magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the ISM using the
FLASH code as part of the SILCC project. The simulations assume a gas surface
density of 10 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ and span metallicities from 1/50 Z$_\odot$ to
1 Z$_\odot$. We include non-equilibrium thermo-chemistry, a space- and
time-variable far-UV background and cosmic ray ionisation rate, metal-dependent
stellar tracks, the formation of HII regions, stellar winds, type II
supernovae, and cosmic ray injection and transport. With the metallicity
decreasing over the investigated range, the star formation rate decreases by
more than a factor of ten, the mass fraction of cold gas decreases from 60% to
2.3%, while the volume filling fraction of the warm gas increases from 20% to
80%. Furthermore, the fraction of H$_\mathrm{2}$ in the densest regions drops
by a factor of four, and the dense ISM fragments into approximately five times
fewer structures at the lowest metallicity. Outflow mass loading factors remain
largely unchanged, with values close to unity, except for a significant decline
at the lowest metallicity. Including the major processes that regulate ISM
properties, this study highlights the strong impact of gas phase metallicity on
the star-forming ISM.

**TL;DR**: 研究发现Abell 2142星系团中一个正在坠落的星系群仍维持恒星形成活动，其延展X射线尾迹源自群内原有热气体而非星系气体剥离，且群内星系相互作用通过富含稠密气体的盘增强了恒星形成。

Method: 采用积分场光谱技术MaNGA和MegaCam测光数据，结合Nburst全谱拟合及Hα、[NII]、[OIII]、Hβ发射线分析气体运动学和激发状态。

Result: 星系群内相互作用仍在通过富含致密气体的盘增强恒星形成。

Abstract: Galaxy clusters produce a very hostile environment to galaxies, whose gas
gets stripped by ram-pressure, suffer galaxy interactions and witness quenching
of their star formation. Clusters, like Abell 2142, grow not only through
galaxy accretion but also through group infall. Our goal is to study the
physical and dynamical state of the most conspicuous infalling group, on a
filament projected at 1.3 Mpc from the Abell 2142 centre. The galaxy group is
the leading edge of a spectacular trailing 700-kpc-long X-ray tail of hot gas
stripped by ram-pressure. The infalling galaxies are not quenched yet, and are
ideal objects to study the transformation processes due to the cluster
environment. We use integral field spectroscopy from MaNGA to derive stellar
and gas kinematics, and MegaCam for ugr photometry. Stellar populations (with
age and metallicity) are obtained through full-spectrum fitting using Nburst.
The gas kinematics and excitation are derived from the line emission of
H$\alpha$, [NII], [OIII] and H$\beta$. The group contains four galaxies, of
which two are merging and partly superposing on the line of sight. With a
simple parametric model for each velocity field, we succeed in disentangling
the contribution of each galaxy and derive their physical state and kinematics.
The galaxies are perturbed, and intra-group gas is observed as tidal tails and
loops. They are mainly disks in rotation, although some regions reveal elevated
dispersion, typical of out-of-equilibrium gas. All galaxies show sustained star
formation, with a global star formation rate of 45 M$_\odot$/yr. We conclude
that the long X-ray tail must have come from the hot intra-group medium,
present before the group infall, and does not correspond to the ram-pressure
stripping of the galaxy gas. The galaxy interactions within the group are still
enhancing the star formation, from the disks that are still rich in dense gas.

**TL;DR**: 研究发现[Ne v] λ3427发射线在43%的超硬X射线活动星系核中稳定存在，与黑洞质量、吸积率等关键性质无关，且在高度遮蔽系统中仍保持高探测率，证实其作为活动星系核示踪剂的可靠性。

Background: 研究高电离窄线[Ne v] λ3427在超硬X射线选活动星系核中的特征及其与AGN基本性质的关系。

Data: 数据来源于BASS项目中340多个超硬X射线（14-195 keV）选定的活动星系核（AGN）样本的观测数据。

Method: 采用光谱测量和统计分析手段研究[Ne v]发射线与X射线辐射的关系。

Result: [Ne v] λ3427 发射线在高度遮蔽 AGN 中仍保持高探测率（>70%），且其与硬X射线辐射的比例关系稳定（log L[Ne v]/L(14-150 keV) = -3.75），证实了该谱线作为 AGN 示踪剂的可靠性。

Abstract: We investigate the high-ionization, narrow [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 emission line
in a sample of over 340 ultrahard X-ray (14-195 keV) selected Active Galactic
Nuclei (AGN) drawn from the BASS project. The analysis includes measurements in
individual and stacked spectra, and considers several key AGN properties such
as X-ray luminosity, supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, Eddington ratios, and
line-of-sight column density. The [Ne v] $\lambda$3427 line is robustly
detected in ~43% (146/341) of the AGN in our sample, with no significant trends
between the detection rate and key AGN/SMBH properties. In particular, the
detection rate remains high even at the highest levels of obscuration (>70% for
log[N_H/cm^-2] > 23). On the other hand, even some of our highest
signal-to-noise spectra (S/N > 50) lack a robust [Ne v] detection. The typical
(median) scaling ratios between [Ne v] line emission and (ultra-)hard X-ray
emission in our sample are log L[Ne v]/L(14-150 keV) = -3.75 and log L[Ne
v]/L(2-10 keV) = -3.36. The scatter on these scaling ratios, of ~0.5 dex, is
comparable to, and indeed smaller than, what is found for other commonly used
tracers of AGN radiative outputs (e.g., [O III] $\lambda$5007). Otherwise, we
find no significant relations between the (relative) strength of [Ne v] and the
basic AGN/SMBH properties under study, in contrast with simple expectations
from models of SMBH accretion flows. Our results reaffirm the usability of [Ne
v] as an AGN tracer even in highly obscured systems, including dual AGN and
high redshift sources.

**TL;DR**: 研究发现红移z>9的星系相较于6<z<9的星系具有更普遍的极端发射线特征、更频繁的恒星形成率快速上升现象以及更高比例的硬电离源和氮富集，揭示了早期宇宙恒星形成条件和星际介质性质的显著演化。

Data: 数据来源于JWST观测的61个红移z=9-14的星系光谱，包括30个新确认的星系，并与401个红移6<z<9的星系光谱进行直接比较。

Method: 通过分析JWST光谱数据测量了静止紫外发射线特性、紫外连续谱斜率及静止光学发射线，并推断恒星质量、特定恒星形成率、尘埃衰减、平均金属丰度和丰度模式。

Result: 在z>9的星系中，CIII]、Hβ和Hγ发射线等效宽度显著增大，且短期恒星形成率快速上升现象更为普遍，表明高红移下恒星形成条件发生转变，导致极端电离源和氮增强光谱更常见。

Abstract: We characterize the JWST spectra of $61$ galaxies at $z=9-14$, including $30$
newly-confirmed galaxies. We directly compare the $z>9$ spectroscopic
properties against $401$ galaxies at $6<z<9$, with the goal of identifying
evolution in the star formation histories and ISM. We measure rest-UV emission
line properties and UV continuum slopes, while also investigating the
rest-optical emission lines for the subset of galaxies at $9.0<z<9.6$. With
these spectra, we constrain the stellar masses, specific star formation rates,
dust attenuation, and the average metallicity and abundance pattern of $z>9$
galaxies. Our dataset indicates that the emission lines undergo a marked change
at $z>9$, with extremely large CIII], H$\beta$, and H$\gamma$ EWs becoming
$2-3\times$ more common at $z>9$ relative to $6<z<9$. Using the spectra, we
infer the distribution of SFRs on short (SFR$_{\rm 3Myr}$) and medium
(SFR$_{\rm 3-50Myr}$) timescales, finding that rapid SFR upturns (large
SFR$_{\rm 3Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm 3-50Myr}$ ratios) are significantly more likely
among $z>9$ galaxies. These results may reflect a larger dispersion in UV
luminosity at fixed halo mass and larger baryon accretion rates at $z>9$,
although other physical effects may also contribute. We suggest that the shift
in star formation conditions explains the prevalence of extreme nebular spectra
that have been detected at $z>9$, with hard ionizing sources and
nitrogen-enhancements becoming more typical at the highest redshifts. Finally,
we identify five $z>9$ spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with red UV colors
($\beta\gtrsim-1.5$), either revealing a small population with moderate dust
attenuation ($\tau_V=0.23-0.35$) or very high density nebular-dominated
galaxies with hot stellar populations.

(log([OIII]5007/H$\beta$$<$0.5). We selected a sample of AGNs from the
spectroscopic zCOSMOS survey with 0.5 $< zsp <$ 0.9 based on the
Mass-Excitation (MEx) diagram and X-ray emission. AGNs were classified as
obscured or unobscured using hydrogen column density, and as high- or
low-excitation based on the [OIII]5007/H$\beta$ ratio. We analysed various AGN
properties, including the hardness ratio, X-ray luminosity, emission line
ratios such as the ionisation-level sensitive parameter
O32=log([OIII]5007/[OII]3727), and the metallicity sensitive parameter
R23=log(([OIII]5007+[OII]3727/H$\beta$), and the specific black hole accretion
rate. Unobscured AGNs exhibit a more evident correlation between the
[OIII]5007/[OII]3727 ionisation ratio and X-ray luminosity than obscured AGNs,
while high-excitation obscured AGNs reach, on average, higher X-ray
luminosities. Furthermore, high-excitation AGNs typically show high values of
R23, suggesting low metallicities, similar to that observed in high-redshift
galaxies (4 $< z <$ 6). We find a positive correlation between the parameters
$\lambda$sBHAR and N$_H$, R23 and O32 parameters. The correlation suggests that
AGNs with a high specific accretion rate have not only a higher production of
high-energy photons, which ionise the surrounding medium more intensely, but
are also usually associated with environments less enriched in heavy elements.
These results provide insights into the complex interplay between AGN activity,
host galaxy properties, and the role of obscuration in shaping galaxy
evolution.

### [12] [A new type-1 transition in NGC 1346 revealed by (spectro)polarimetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08589)
*F. Marin,D. Hutsemékers,S. Jorstad*

**TL;DR**: 首次观测到活动星系核NGC 1346从2型转变为1型光谱态，发现其宽发射线增强且蓝移，排除了视线方向云层遮挡的可能性，提出宽线区再照射或潮汐瓦解事件两种解释机制。

Background: 研究活动星系核的光谱类型转变现象及其物理机制。

Method: 采用珀金斯望远镜和VLT/FORS2进行的光谱偏振观测。

Result: NGC~1346从2004-2022年的2型活动星系核状态恢复到了2001年的1型光谱状态，可能是由于宽线区被重新照亮或发生了潮汐瓦解事件。

Abstract: We present the first photo- and spectropolarimetric observations of the
changing-look active galactic nucleus NGC~1346 taken with the Perkins telescope
(November 2022, March 2025) and VLT/FORS2 (August and September 2024), which
have revealed a new spectral transition. We find that NGC~1346 has reverted to
its former (2001) type-1 spectral state after having been a type-2 active
galactic nucleus from 2004 to 2022. More and more intense broad H$\beta$ (3720
$\pm$ 310 km.s$^{-1}$ full width at half maximum) and H$\alpha$ (2985 $\pm$ 230
km.s$^{-1}$) emission lines appeared between August and September 2024,
suggesting that the broad-line region (BLR) is increasingly irradiated. The
strong blueshift of the Balmer lines ($\sim$ 1600 km.s$^{-1}$) indicates that
the gas is moving toward the observer, possibly due to a radiation-driven
outflow. The strong difference between 2022's ($\sim$ 3\%) and 2024-2025's
de-biased polarization ($\le$ 0.5\%), the blueing of the spectra between August
and September 2024, and the slow rise in the integrated flux between 2022 and
2025 argue against asymmetric or temporary obscuration by a cloud passing in
front of the line of sight. Two options, either a re-illumination of the BLR or
a tidal disruption event, can explain the observed properties of NGC~1346.
Timely follow-up observations taken while the phenomenon is still ongoing are
needed to determine which of the two solutions is the correct one.

Abstract: We present results of optical identifications for Very Large Array Sky Survey
(VLASS) radio sources using the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern
Survey (UNIONS). A cross-match between UNIONS and VLASS Epoch 2 catalogs yields
146,212 radio galaxies down to $r=24.5$ mag over a wide area of $\sim4,200\
\mathrm{deg^2}$. We perform g-dropout selections and find $>200$ sources at
$z\sim4$ optimistically. Of 63,019 sources with valid photo-$z$, 8,692 are at
$z_\mathrm{photo}>1$, and 1,171 are at $z_\mathrm{photo}>2$. Based on spectral
luminosities at 1.4 GHz using the valid photo-$z$, we identify $\sim49,000$
radio-loud AGNs (RLAGNs) with $\textit{L}_\mathrm{1.4GHz}>10^{24}$ W/Hz, and
all radio galaxies at $z>1$ are RL. Adopting radio loudness instead, 138,266
out of 146,212 UNIONS-VLASS radio galaxies are RL. Thus, our catalog greatly
increases the number counts of RLAGNs at $z>1$. We further cross-match the
UNIONS-VLASS catalog with LOw-Frequency ARray Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) at
144 MHz and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) at 1.4 GHz,
yielding 101,671 UNIONS-VLASS-LoTSS, 79,638 -FIRST, and 64,672 -LoTSS-FIRST
sources, respectively. This multifrequency radio dataset reveals sources of
various spectral shapes, including the steep spectrum of aged populations, the
peaked spectrum of young populations, and the upturned spectrum potentially
associated with transient sources. The UNIONS-VLASS radio galaxies will be
covered by the Euclid wide survey, offering legacy values to benefit
multi-faceted studies related to RLAGNs and beyond.

Abstract: Using the {\it Hubble Space Telescope}/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph,
ultraviolet (UV) extinction curves have been measured in M31 along thirteen new
sightlines, increasing the M31 sample to seventeen. This sample covers a wide
area of M31 having galactocentric distances of 5 to 16 kpc, enabling the
analysis of UV extinction curve variations over a large region of an external
galaxy similar to the Milky Way with global galactic characteristics such as
metallicity for the first time. No correlation is found between the extinction
parameters and galactocentric distance which might be expected if there is a
radial metallicity gradient in M31. Most of the new UV extinction curves
presented here are significantly different from the average extinction curves
of the Milky Way, LMC, and SMC, but the average M31 extinction curve is similar
to the average extinction curve in the 30-Dor region of the LMC. The wide range
of extinction curves seen in each individual Local Group galaxy suggests that
global galactic properties such as metallicity may be less important than the
local environmental conditions such as density, UV radiation field, and shocks
along each sightline. The combined behavior of the Milky Way, LMC, SMC, and now
M31 UV extinction curves supports the idea that there is a family of curves in
the Local Group with overlapping dust grain properties between different
galaxies.

Abstract: This paper explores the gas metallicity gradients in a sample of 25 nearby
galaxies using new Integral Field Spectroscopy observations from the
Metal-THINGS survey. We derive and study the resolved diffuse ionised gas
content, Baldwin, Phillips and Terlevich diagrams and gas metallicities for our
entire sample, at spatial resolutions of 40-300 pc. Gas metallicity gradients
are studied as a function of the galaxy's stellar mass, H I gas fraction,
diffuse ionised gas content, and using different parametric length scales for
normalisation. The metallicity gradients are analysed using Bayesian statistics
based on data from the Metal-THINGS survey. Bayesian MCMC models are developed
to explore how metallicity gradients vary with a galaxy's mass and how they
correlate with properties such as the stellar mass or the atomic gas fraction.
For our sample, we find that the metallicity typically decreases with galactic
radius, consistent with inside-out galaxy growth. We find a trend dependent on
the stellar mass, with a break at log(M_star/M_sun)=9.5, and another between
the metallicity gradients and the atomic gas fraction (f_g,HI) of a galaxy at
fg,HI=0.75, indicating relatively shallower gradients for lower gas fractions.
We find that normalisation using NUV-band effective radii are preferable for
galaxies with a higher atomic gas content and lower stellar masses, while
r-band radii are better suited for those with lower atomic gas fractions and
more massive ones. Our results highlight a strong connection between gas
content, stellar mass, and metallicity gradients. The breaks at
log(M_star/M_sun)=9.5 and fg,HI=0.75 mark shifts in chemical enrichment
behaviour, with low-mass galaxies showing greater sensitivity to gas processes.
Overall, this points to gas accretion and removal as key drivers of chemical
evolution in low-mass systems.

Abstract: We present a detailed spectroscopic study of ionised gas in the nearby
(~3.3Mpc) dwarf galaxy NGC 2366, a local analogue of Green Pea galaxies, based
on observations with the SCORPIO-2 instrument at the Russian 6-m BTA telescope.
Using scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry and long-slit spectroscopy, we
examine the gas kinematics, excitation mechanisms, and chemical abundances
across the disc of NGC 2366, including its prominent starburst region Mrk 71
and the companion region NGC 2363. We identified 20 regions with locally
elevated Ha velocity dispersion, only four of which correspond to known
high-energy sources. We argue that one of the remaining objects can be a
previously unidentified Wolf-Rayet star and two - supernova remnants. For 15
HII regions, we measure electron temperatures, oxygen and nitrogen abundances
via the `direct' Te method, with 12 + log(O/H) ranging from 7.6 to 8.0 in most
of the regions. We show that Mrk 71 has higher oxygen abundance compared to the
other \HII regions in the galaxy, contrary to the previous indirect estimates
suggesting flat gradient throughout the galaxy. Together with the localized
spatial variations of metallicity in the area, it is indicative of metal
enrichment by the outflow from the super star cluster in the centre of Mrk 71.

Result: 在THESAN-ZOAM模拟中发现，平滑弯曲的气相和恒星质量-金属丰度关系在z≈12时已形成并缓慢演化至z=3，主要由星系金属保留效率而非气体分数驱动。

Abstract: We present an analysis of metallicities and chemical abundances at $3<z<12$
in the THESAN-ZOOM simulations. We find that smoothly curved gas-phase and
stellar mass-metallicity relations (MZR) are already in place at $z\approx12$
and evolve slowly ($\sim$0.2 dex increase for gas, $\sim$0.4 dex increase for
stars at a fixed stellar mass) down to $z=3$, governed largely by the
efficiency with which galaxies retain their metals, rather than gas fraction.
The canonical fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) survives in stars but
breaks down and inverts for gas in low-mass galaxies
($M_\ast\lesssim10^{9}\mathrm{M_\odot}$) due to regular dilution by
low-metallicity gas inflow. We find broad agreement of gas-phase N/O, Fe/O, and
C/O with high-redshift observations, including the presence of nitrogen-rich
galaxies (NRGs; $\log(\mathrm{N/O})>-0.6$) without the need for exotic yields
in our chemical network. Instead, bursty star formation naturally generates
order-of-magnitude excursions in N/O on $\lesssim$100 Myr timescales due to
temporally differential galactic winds; after a starburst, stellar feedback
expels gas, leaving a large population of asymptotic-giant-branch stars to
dominate the enrichment of the relatively low-mass interstellar medium. NRGs
lie below the main sequence and typically exhibit
$\mathrm{EW}[H$\beta$]\lesssim40$ \r{A}, in apparent tension with observed
high-EW NRGs. This tension is reconciled if observed NRGs are in the initial
stages of a subsequent starburst, illuminating previously enriched gas, which
is supported by the finding of high SFR surface density nitrogen-rich giant
molecular clouds.

Result: 邻近活动星系核的恒星形成星系中，61%呈现恒星形成抑制而39%表现为增强，效应呈现质量依赖性且受气体含量和距离调控。

Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are among the most energetic phenomena in the
universe, capable of regulating star formation in galaxies via radiative and
mechanical feedback. While AGN feedback is well studied in host galaxies, its
influence on neighbouring galaxies within the same large-scale environment
remains less understood. In this work, we use the EAGLE cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation to examine how proximity to AGN affects star
formation in nearby star-forming galaxies (SFGs) out to 2 Mpc. A control sample
matched in stellar mass and local density allows us to isolate AGN-driven
environmental effects, quantified through the $\Delta$SFR offset defined as the
difference between a galaxy's star formation rate (SFR) and that of its matched
controls. We find a significant and mass-dependent impact where $61\%$ of
AGN-adjacent SFGs show suppressed star formation, while $39\%$ exhibit
enhancement. Although the overall magnitude of these offsets is modest, the
trends are statistically robust and consistent across the population.
Suppression is prevalent in massive, gas-poor galaxies in high-mass halos,
consistent with thermal feedback inhibiting gas cooling. Enhanced SFRs appear
in low-mass, gas-rich galaxies, suggesting AGN-driven compression may locally
trigger star formation. These trends emerge despite EAGLE implementing AGN
feedback as a single-mode, stochastic thermal process, indicating that such
models can reproduce both quenching and triggering regimes. Our findings
demonstrate that AGN feedback extends well beyond host galaxies, impacting
neighbouring systems in a non-uniform, distance-, mass-, and gas-dependent
manner. This non-local AGN influence represents a critical, yet often
overlooked, mechanism in shaping galaxy evolution within large-scale
structures, bridging high-energy astrophysical processes and cosmic-scale
environmental regulation.

adequate mathematical treatment. As we mention previously, to test the outlined
model, a Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis is implemented, using Cosmic

Result: 随机参数波动通过改变共振结构的稳定带显著增强了再加热过程中的粒子产生效率。

Abstract: Cosmic inflation provides a compelling framework for explaining several
observed features of our Universe, but its viability depends on an efficient
reheating phase that converts the inflaton's energy into Standard Model
particles. This conversion often proceeds through non-perturbative mechanisms
such as parametric resonance, which is described by Hill's equation. In this
work, we investigate how stochastic fluctuations in the parameters of Hill's
equation can influence particle production during reheating. We show that such
fluctuations can arise from couplings to light scalar fields, and can
significantly alter the stability bands in the resonance structure, thereby
enhancing the growth of fluctuations and broadening the region of efficient
energy transfer. Using random matrix theory and stochastic differential
equations, we decompose the particle growth rate into deterministic and
noise-induced components and demonstrate analytically and numerically that even
modest noise leads to substantial particle production in otherwise stable
regimes. These results suggest that stochastic effects can robustly enhance the
efficacy of reheating across a wide swath of parameter space, with implications
for early Universe cosmology, UV completions involving multiple scalar fields,
and the resolution of the cosmological moduli problem.

Abstract: Despite overwhelming observational evidence for dark matter, we still have no
evidence of direct detection. Consequently, our knowledge about dark matter is
limited, for example, we do not know if dark matter is a stable particle or if
it decays. Without a theoretical particle model, the parameter space of
possible decay models is highly variable, and astrophysical or cosmological
means of indirectly constraining the phenomenological models are required. This
paper investigates a scenario in which a dark matter decays and the dark
daughter particle moves with respect to the comoving mother particle. The model
is parameterised by the decay rate and the injection velocity of the dark
matter particles, which can be converted to the mass ratio. In previous work, a
simpler model was used to investigate the evolution of cosmic voids typified as
regions with low content of galaxies and non-baryonic matter. It was found that
the growth of S-type voids is modified by the dark matter decay, leading to
imprints at the present day. Here we extend our study and improve the method
used to model the decay. We also study the gravitational weak-lensing signal
that will be able to detect or constrain the parameter space of decaying dark
matter. The results of this study suggest that future weak lensing surveys may
provide unique probes of the phenomological parameters of dark matter.

Abstract: Differences in the values of the Hubble constant obtained from the local
universe and the early universe have resulted in a significant tension. This
tension signifies that our understanding of cosmology (physical processes
and/or cosmological data) is incomplete. Some of the suggested solutions
include physics of the early Universe. In this paper we aim to investigate
common features of various early universe solutions to the Hubble constant
tension. The physics of the early universe affects the size of the sound
horizon which is probed with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Within
the standard model, the size of the horizon (within limits of current
measurements) is affected by processes that could occur between (approximately)
1 day after the Big Bang and the last scattering instant. We focus on simple
extensions incorporating Early Dark Energy (EDE) and show how such a model
affects the inferred values of the Hubble constant. We compare this model to
LambdaCDM models using MCMC analysis, likelihoods over the parameter space and
Bayesian evidence. The MCMC analysis shows that EDE leads to a decrease in the
size of the sound horizon that is consistent with H0 = 73.56 km/s/Mpc but we
also show that MCMC analysis favours increasing redshift and proportion of EDE.
The Bayesian evidence favours our EDE model for very narrow, finely-tuned
parameter space. The LambdaCDM model used for comparison has good evidence
across a wide parameter space. We interpret this as an indication that more
sophisticated models are required. We conclude that if the Hubble tension were
to be related to the physics of the early universe, EDE could be used as a
window to explore conditions of the early universe and extend our understanding
of that era.

Abstract: Euclid is presently mapping the distribution of matter in the Universe in
detail via the weak lensing (WL) signature of billions of distant galaxies. The
WL signal is most prominent around galaxy clusters, and can extend up to
distances well beyond their virial radius, thus constraining their total mass.
Near the centre of clusters, where contamination by member galaxies is an
issue, the WL data can be complemented with strong lensing (SL) data which can
diminish the uncertainty due to the mass-sheet degeneracy and provide
high-resolution information about the distribution of matter in the centre of
clusters. Here we present a joint SL and WL analysis of the Euclid Early
Release Observations of the cluster Abell 2390 at z=0.228. Thanks to Euclid's
wide field of view of 0.5 deg$^$2, combined with its angular resolution in the
visible band of 0."13 and sampling of 0."1 per pixel, we constrain the density
profile in a wide range of radii, 30 kpc < r < 2000 kpc, from the inner region
near the brightest cluster galaxy to beyond the virial radius of the cluster.
We find consistency with earlier X-ray results based on assumptions of
hydrostatic equilibrium, thus indirectly confirming the nearly relaxed state of
this cluster. We also find consistency with previous results based on weak
lensing data and ground-based observations of this cluster. From the combined
SL+WL profile, we derive the values of the viral mass $M_{200} = (1.48 \pm
0.29)\times10^{15}\, \Msun$, and virial radius $r_{200} =(2.05\pm0.13 \, {\rm
Mpc}$), with error bars representing one standard deviation. The profile is
well described by an NFW model with concentration c=6.5 and a small-scale
radius of 230 kpc in the 30\,kpc $< r <$ 2000\,kpc range that is best
constrained by SL and WL data. Abell 2390 is the first of many examples where
Euclid data will play a crucial role in providing masses for clusters.

Background: 探索宇宙长丝结构中缺失重子物质的分布及其对宇宙重子总质量的贡献。

Method: 采用叠加分析、几何偏差校正和等温圆柱对称气体分布模型，联合拟合Compton-y和透镜收敛剖面。

Result: 在选定的长丝结构中，丝状WHIM对宇宙重子预算的贡献显著，重子分数为0.124^{+0.020}_{-0.021} × Ω_b。

Abstract: We investigate the distribution of missing baryons in cosmic filaments by
stacking approximately 31,300 filaments across the northern and southern SDSS
sky regions using Planck Compton-$y$ and CMB lensing maps. Filaments are
identified using the DisPerSE algorithm applied to the SDSS LOWZ-CMASS galaxy
samples, selecting structures with lengths between 30-100 cMpc and redshifts in
the range $0.2 < z < 0.6$. Radial profiles are extracted out to 25 cMpc from
the filament spines, and galaxy clusters with halo masses above $3 \times
10^{13}$ solar masses are masked to reduce contamination. We detect the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) signal at $7.82\sigma$ and the CMB lensing signal at
$7.78\sigma$. The stacked profiles are corrected by a geometric bias related to
filament inclination with respect to the line of sight, and modeled assuming
isothermal, cylindrically symmetric gas distributions. We explore different gas
and matter density distributions, focusing on $\beta$-models with $(\alpha,
\beta) = (2, 2/3)$ or $(1, 1)$. By jointly fitting the Compton-$y$ and lensing
convergence profiles, we constrain the central electron overdensity and
temperature to be $\delta = 5.90^{+4.18}_{-1.98}$ and $T_e =
2.71^{+0.63}_{-0.51} \times 10^6$ K for the standard $\beta$-model. These
results suggest that the filamentary WHIM in our selected long filaments
contributes a significant baryon fraction of $0.124^{+0.020}_{-0.021} \times$
{\Omega}_b to the cosmic baryon budget.

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Poisson formalism has found a number of applications in
cosmology, particularly in describing the growth by gravitational instability
of large-scale structure in a universe dominated by ultra-light scalar
particles. Here we investigate the extent to which the behaviour of this and
the more general case of a Schr\"odinger-Newton system, can be described in
terms of classical fluid concepts such as viscosity and pressure. We also
explore whether such systems can be described by a pseudo-Reynolds number as
for classical viscous fluids. The conclusion we reach is that this is indeed
possible, but with important restrictions to ensure physical consistency.

Abstract: We investigate the growth of cosmic structures in the thermodynamically
consistent generalised mass-to-horizon entropic cosmology (MHEC). For the
Bekenstein case the entropic energy density augments the Friedmann equations
without modifying the Hawking temperature and automatically satisfies the
Clausius relation, thereby avoiding the inconsistencies that afflicted earlier
entropy-force models. We then derive the linear perturbation equations,
emphasising the distinction between a fully perturbed interaction term and the
common approximation in which the perturbation is neglected. Numerical
solutions show that fully perturbed follows the LCDM matter-growth history
within the current growth uncertainties. Our results demonstrate that MHEC
matches both background and growth probes as well as LCDM without extra free
parameters, providing a viable entropic explanation for recent accelerated
expansion of the Universe.

Result: 通过级联衰变暗物质模型将哈勃张力降低至3.2σ，同时产生更大的S8、更小的ns及更大的物质功率谱。

Abstract: Hubble tension can be alleviated by altering either early- or late-time
$\Lambda$CDM. So far, extensive studies have shown that only early dark energy
or ad hoc combinations of those two-fold effects can reduce the tension to
$3\sigma$ or lower. In this work, we improve the later solution by considering
a cascade decaying dark matter sector, where a parent particle produces
relativistic dark matter in the early Universe and the dark matter subsequently
decays to neutrinos in the late-time Universe. We parametrize this model with
four model parameters, carry out a Markov Chain Monte Carlo fit to Planck
2018+BAO+Pantheon data sets, and compare it to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis limits,
neutrino flux bounds, and Planck and SDSS data about matter power spectra.
Within parameter regions reducing the Hubble tension to $3.2\sigma$ and
compatible with the existing constraints, the main phenomenological features
include a larger $S_{8}\sim 0.84$, smaller $n_{s}\sim 0.95$ and larger matter
power spectra relative to the $\Lambda$CDM, which are left for future tests.

Abstract: The cosmography known as the Pad\'{e} polynomials has been widely used in the
reconstruction of luminosity distance, and the orders of Pad\'{e} polynomials
influence the reconstructed result derived from Pad\'{e} approximation. In this
paper, we present a more general scheme of selecting optimal Pad\'{e}
polynomial for reconstruction of luminosity distance based on 10-fold
cross-validation. Then the proposed scheme is applied to Pantheon+ dataset. The
numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed procedure has a remarkable
ability to distinguish Pad\'{e} approximations with different orders for the
reconstruction of the luminosity distance. We conclude that the (2,1) Pad\'e
approximation is the optimal approach that can well explain Pantheon+ data at
low and high red-shifts. Future applications of this scheme could help choose
the optimal model that is more suitable for cosmological observation data at
hand and gain a deeper understanding of the universe.

Result: 提出了一种从具有一般自相互作用的相对论理论中系统推导非相对论有效场论的框架，放宽了场振幅小的限制并建立了非相对论标量场的有效流体描述。

Abstract: Non-relativistic effective field theories (NREFTs) play a crucial role in
various areas of physics, from cold atom experiments to cosmology. In this
paper, we present a systematic framework for deriving NREFTs from relativistic
theories with generic self-interactions. Our approach allows for (but is not
limited to) non-power-law potentials (such as those arising from dilatons or
axions) or potentials that are non-analytic around the classical vacuum (such
as those with logarithmic radiative corrections). These are of theoretical and
phenomenological interest but have largely been unexplored in the
non-relativistic regime. NREFTs are typically viewed as approximations for
systems with low velocities, weak couplings, and small field amplitudes. The
latter assumption is relaxed in our approach, as long as the mass term remains
dominant (ensuring the validity of the non-relativistic limit). Additionally,
we establish an effective fluid description for the non-relativistic scalar
field, identifying key quantities such as energy density, pressure, and sound
speed. To enable cosmological applications, we extend our formalism to account
for the expanding universe, providing a reliable tool for investigating
ultra-light dark matter models with arbitrary self-interactions. Finally, we
demonstrate the applicability of our NREFT in analyzing solitons, which is also
relevant to cosmology for studying celestial objects such as boson stars and
the cores of dark matter halos.

Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of the perturbative nonlinear dynamics of
cosmological fluctuations in dark sectors comprising a fraction of non-cold
dark matter, for example ultra-light axions or light thermal relics. These
mixed dark matter scenarios exhibit suppressed growth of perturbations below a
characteristic, cosmologically relevant, scale associated with the microscopic
nature of the non-cold species. As a consequence, the scale-free nonlinear
solutions developed for pure cold dark matter and for massive neutrinos do not,
in general, apply. We thus extend the Effective Field Theory of Large Scale
Structure to model the coupled fluctuations of the cold and non-cold dark
matter components, describing the latter as a perfect fluid with finite sound
speed at linear level. We provide new analytical solutions wherever possible
and devise an accurate and computationally tractable prescription for the
evaluation of the one-loop galaxy power spectrum, which can be applied to probe
mixed dark matter scenarios with current and upcoming galaxy survey data. As a
first application of this framework, we derive updated constraints on the
energy density in ultra-light axions using a combination of Planck and BOSS
data. Our refined theoretical modeling leads to somewhat weaker bounds compared
to previous analyses.

Abstract: We measure the amplitude of matter fluctuations over a wide range of
redshifts by combining CMB lensing observations from ACT DR6 and
$\textit{Planck}$ PR4 with the overdensity of quasars from Quaia, a
$\textit{Gaia}$ and $\textit{unWISE}$ quasar catalog. Our analysis includes the
CMB lensing power spectrum from ACT DR6, the auto-correlation of two Quaia
quasar samples centered at $z \simeq 1.0$ and $z \simeq 2.1$, and their
cross-correlations with CMB lensing from both ACT DR6 and $\textit{Planck}$
PR4. By performing a series of contamination and systematic null tests, we find
no evidence for contamination in the lensing maps, contrary to what was
suggested in previous Quaia cross-correlation analyses using $\textit{Planck}$
PR4 CMB lensing data. From the joint analysis of the quasar auto- and
cross-correlations with CMB lensing, and including BOSS BAO data to break the
degeneracy between $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, we obtain $\sigma_8 =
0.802^{+0.045}_{-0.057}$, consistent with $\Lambda$CDM predictions from
$\textit{Planck}$ primary CMB measurements. Combining the CMB lensing
auto-spectrum with the cross-correlation measurement improves the constraint on
$\sigma_8$ by $12\%$ relative to the lensing auto-spectrum alone, yielding
$\sigma_8 = 0.804 \pm 0.013$. This dataset combination also enables a
reconstruction of structure growth across redshifts. We infer a $12\%$
constraint on the amplitude of matter fluctuations at $z > 3$, with a
measurement at the median redshift of the signal of $\sigma_8(\tilde{z}=5.1) =
0.146^{+0.021}_{-0.014}$, consistent with $\textit{Planck}$ at the $1.4\sigma$
level. These results provide one of the highest redshift constraints on the
growth of structure to date.

Abstract: Deep imaging of structures from the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and the Epoch of
Reionization (EoR) in five targeted fields is one of the highest priority
scientific objectives for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Selecting 'quiet'
fields, which allow deep imaging, is critical for future SKA CD/EoR
observations. Pre-observations using existing radio facilities will help
estimate the computational capabilities required for optimal data quality and
refine data reduction techniques. In this study, we utilize data from the
Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II extended array for a selected field to
study the properties of foregrounds. We conduct deep imaging across two
frequency bands: 72-103 MHz and 200-231 MHz. We identify up to 2,576 radio
sources within a 5-degree radius of the image center (at RA (J2000) $8^h$ , Dec
(J2000) 5{\deg}), achieving approximately 80% completeness at 7.7 mJy and 90%
at 10.4 mJy for 216 MHz, with a total integration time of 4.43 hours and an
average RMS of 1.80 mJy. Additionally, we apply a foreground removal algorithm
using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and calculate the angular power
spectra of the residual images. Our results indicate that nearly all resolved
radio sources can be successfully removed using PCA, leading to a reduction in
foreground power. However, the angular power spectra of the residual map
remains over an order of magnitude higher than the theoretically predicted
CD/EoR 21 cm signal. Further improvements in data reduction and foreground
subtraction techniques will be necessary to enhance these results.

with polarimetric capability. Since the MeV gamma-ray energy range is the most
under-explored electromagnetic window to the Universe, a mission in this energy
range can for the first time sensitively address fundamental astrophysics
questions connected to the physics of compact objects and merger events, jets
and their environments, supernovae and the origin of the elements, potentially
constrain the nature of dark matter and many more science objectives. The

crystal calorimeter. Both detectors are surrounded by an anti-coincidence
detector to reject charged cosmic rays. In addition, a thin X-ray coded mask
provides very good imaging capabilities. Such a mission can uniquely detect
gamma rays via the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering and
electron-positron pair production. newASTROGAM is proposed to the ESA call for
medium-class mission ideas (M8).

Method: 采用超稳定硅腔结合激光频率稳定技术探测超轻暗物质引起的腔长波动。

Result: 超轻标量暗物质会影响物体长度而不改变光速，法布里-珀罗腔可作为探测工具。

Abstract: Astrophysical observations suggest the existence of an unknown kind of matter
in the Universe, in the frame of the $\Lambda$CDM model. The research field of
dark matter covers an energy scale going from massive objects to ultra-light
scalar fields, which are the focus of the present work. It is supposed that
ultra-light scalar fields affect the length of objects, whereas the speed of
light stays unchanged. It follows that Fabry-Perot cavities are ideal tools for
ultra-light dark matter detection since the fluctuations in the length of a
cavity can be detected on the frequency of the laser stabilized to it. At
FEMTO-ST, we have set up an ultra-stable silicon cavity suitable for a test of
detection of ultra-light dark matter in an energy range close to 10$^{-10}$ eV.
Our 14 cm cavity is composed of two mirrors optically bonded to an ultra-rigid
spacer, with each element made in single-crystal of silicon, and cooled at 17 K
in order to cancel the first order thermal expansion coefficient of the silicon
spacer. The projected fractional frequency stability of the laser is $3 \times
10^{-17}$, mainly limited by the thermal noise of the amorphous dielectric
reflective coatings. To reach this remarkable stability, several effects have
to be reduced below the thermal noise limit. While the contribution of the
residual amplitude modulation is now acceptable, we are currently implementing
a laser power lock with residual fluctuations lower than 3~nW and a
piezoelectric-based servo loop to actively reduce the vibration noise that has
to be inferior to $-110 \textrm{~dB(m s}^{-2})^2/\textrm{Hz}$ at 1 Hz. Here, we
present both the status of the development of our ultra-stable laser and the
mechanical response of the cavity in the presence of ultra-light dark matter.

Abstract: Cubesats present unique opportunities for observational astronomy in the
modern era. They are useful in observing difficult-to-access wavelength regions
and long-term monitoring of interesting astronomical sources. However,
conventional telescope designs are not necessarily the best fit for restricted
envelope of a Cubesat. Additionally, fine-pointing stability on these platforms
is difficult due to the low mass of the spacecraft and special allocations
within the optical design are needed to achieve stable pointing. We propose
afocal telescope designs as the framework to realise imagers and low-resolution
spectrographs on Cubesat platforms. These designs help reduce the number of
components in the optical chain and aim to improve throughput and sensitivity
compared to conventional designs. Additionally, they also provide a fine
steering mechanism within a collimated beam section. Fine beam steering within
the collimated beam section avoids issues of image degradation due to
out-of-plane rotation of the image plane or offset in the rotation axis of the
mirror. This permits the use of simple and mostly off-the-shelf tip-tilt
mirrors for beam steering. The designs discussed here also allow for a standard
telescope design to be used in many instrument types; thus reducing the
complexity as well as the development time and cost. The optical design,
performance and SNR estimations of these designs along with some interesting
science cases are discussed. A number of practical aspects in implementation
such as guiding, tolerancing, choice of detectors, vibration analysis and
laboratory test setups are also presented.

currently performed is always 'local'. In the proposed talk we will present the

calibration for astronomical high-resolution, high-precision spectrographs by
embarking an optical frequency comb on-board a satellite equipped with an
actively pointing telescope and precision orbitography. This calibration

Abstract: An innovative optical module (OM) with segmented light-sensitive area has
been developed for IceCube-Gen2 that will take neutrino astronomy at the South
Pole to the next level. It builds on the successful features of the mDOM and
D-Egg modules of IceCube Upgrade while adapting to the smaller borehole
diameter of IceCube-Gen2. The newly developed OM, which is being tested in
IceCube Upgrade, serves as a prototype for the planned mass production of about
10,000 OMs for IceCube-Gen2. To simplify the assembly process, important
changes were made to the design, in particular to integrate the new gel pad
concept. This replaces the 3D-printed support structure of the mDOM while
maintaining through total internal reflection the increased light collection
efficiency of the reflector rings. In addition, the design features local
generation of high voltage for each photomultiplier tube (PMT) via a
Cockcroft-Walton circuit and the full digitization of the signal on each PMT
base with a sampling rate of 60 MSpS. This significantly reduces the complexity
of the mainboard so that it fits into the limited space available. This article
describes the development status and presents the performance of the first
prototypes.

Abstract: A precise understanding of the optical properties of the instrumented
Antarctic ice sheet is crucial to the performance of optical Cherenkov
telescopes such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and its planned successor,
IceCube-Gen2. One complication arising from the large envisioned footprint of
IceCube-Gen2 is the larger impact of the so-called ice tilt. It describes the
undulation of ice layers of constant optical properties within the detector. In
this contribution, we will describe the project to build a co-deployed laser
dust logger. This is a device to measure the stratigraphy of impurities in the
ice to derive the ice tilt. It consists of a light source that will be
co-deployed with the photosensor modules, meaning it is part of the deployment
string and operated during the deployment of the detector. The newly developed
device will be tested during the deployment of the IceCube Upgrade in the

Result: 利用AERA测量的宇宙射线无线电脉冲结合CoREAS模拟，发现其确定的绝对能量比荧光探测器高12%，系统误差范围内一致，验证了Pierre Auger天文台的绝对能量标度。

Abstract: The accurate determination of the absolute energy scale in cosmic ray
measurements is both a challenging and fundamentally important task. We present
how measurements of radio pulses from extensive air showers with the Auger
Engineering Radio Array, combined with per-event simulations of radio emission
using the CoREAS extension of CORSIKA, allow us to determine the energy scale
of cosmic rays between $3\cdot 10^{17}$\,eV and several $10^{18}$\,eV. Our
analysis accounts for many factors, each of which is controlled on the 5\%
level or better. The absolute calibration of the antennas and the entire analog
signal chain builds on a Galactic calibration in combination with a detailed
understanding of the antenna-gain patterns. Additional key elements include
compensation for temperature-dependent signal amplification, continuous
detector health monitoring, an active veto for thunderstorm conditions, an
unbiased event reconstruction, and per-event atmospheric modeling in the
simulations. The analysis benefits from a high-statistics dataset of over 800
measured cosmic ray showers. We describe our analysis method, perform multiple
cross-checks, and evaluate systematic uncertainties. We find that absolute
energies determined with AERA are 12\% higher than those established with the
Auger Fluorescence Detector, a result well in agreement within systematic
uncertainties and thus a strong independent confirmation of the absolute energy
scale of the Pierre Auger Observatory.

Abstract: Since 2021, the Open Data Portal has provided access to the Pierre Auger
Observatory's data for both the scientific community and the general public.
The data release process has been in place since the Observatory's foundation.
It continues to be strengthened as outlined in the approved policy and the

$10^{17}$ eV, detected with the surface and fluorescence detectors, have been
released at various levels, from calibrated traces to high-level reconstruction
parameters. Additionally, atmospheric data and low-energy particle counting
rates have been made available for space weather studies. The Collaboration is
committed to releasing FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable)
data, along with accompanying software and detailed documentation, enabling
users to perform their own queries and analyses for both research and
educational purposes. These datasets have already served as a basis for several
scientific papers and have been widely used in various outreach activities.
After 20 years of stable data acquisition, the Pierre Auger Collaboration will
disclose 30% of the cosmic ray events above $2.5 \cdot 10^{18}$ eV collected
with the main surface detector array between 2004 and 2022, corresponding to an
exposure of about 24 000 km$^2$ sr yr, together with events detected with the
fluorescence detector and used for energy calibration. This release will
provide an unprecedented public dataset for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays,
enabling in-depth studies of their properties. Together with the published

the Pierre Auger Collaboration's strong commitment to distributed and
collective knowledge, sharing progress with the entire scientific community.

Abstract: The surface detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory has recently been
upgraded with the addition of radio antennas, forming the radio detector (RD).
This contribution outlines the standard methods for reconstructing extensive
air showers using the RD, along with recent developments. The reconstruction
pipeline is based on a robust understanding of the detector itself. The entire
instrument, including the antenna pattern and analog chain, has been
meticulously characterized within the Offline software framework, based on
measurements in the laboratory as well as in the field. To ensure data
integrity, stations identified as unreliable through monitoring are excluded
before event reconstruction. Absolute calibration is achieved at the 5 percent
level by analyzing the diffuse galactic radio emission. Next, the electric
field that induced voltages in the antenna is calculated by unfolding the
antenna response pattern. Key observables, such as the energy fluence (the
energy deposited in the ground per unit area) and the arrival time of the
pulse, are then determined. With these quantities, shower parameters can be
reconstructed with very good accuracy in two chi-square-minimization fits: one
to determine the shower's arrival direction via a spherical wavefront fit
(predicted within 0.2 degree), and the other to estimate the distance to the
shower maximum and the electromagnetic cascade energy (predicted within 5
percent) using a lateral density function

Abstract: Accurate and efficient maneuver detection is critical for ensuring the safety
and predictability of spacecraft trajectories. This paper presents a novel
maneuver detection approach based on comparing the confidence levels associated
with the orbital state estimation and the observation likelihood. First, a
confidence-dominance maneuver indicator (CDMI) is proposed by setting a
confidence level for the state estimation and computing the maximum likelihood
of the observation and its confidence level. The CDMI then flag a maneuver when
the observation's confidence level exceeds that of the state estimation,
indicating that the observation is unlikely under the no-maneuver hypothesis
while maintaining consistency with the prior state estimation confidence. To
efficiently compute the maximum likelihood of the observation and obtain the
CDMI, a recursive polynomial optimization method is developed, taking advantage
of convex optimization and polynomial approximation. In addition, an integrated
CDMI approach is developed to eliminate the need to manually select the state
confidence level. The integrated CDMI approach maintains high detection
accuracy while simultaneously providing an indication of maneuver likelihood,
thereby enhancing robustness and practical applicability. The performance of
the proposed CDMI-based maneuver detection approaches is evaluated against an
optimal control distance metric and two mixture-based approaches. The
simulation results demonstrate that the proposed integrated CDMI approach can
achieve up to 99.33\% detection accuracy, at least 10% higher than the
competing methods, while substantially reducing computational costs.

Result: 3I/ATLAS的彗星活动显著贡献了其亮度，且其高相对速度表明其年龄约为3-11 Gyr，可能形成于低金属丰度系统。

Abstract: The recent discovery of the third interstellar object (3I/ATLAS) expands the
known census from two to three and significantly improves statistical
inferences regarding the underlying galactic population. 3I/ATLAS exhibits
detectable activity that may increase as the object approaches perihelion. In
this paper, we argue that the cometary activity likely significantly
contributes to 3I/ATLAS's brightness, since the nuclear size of 3I/ATLAS
assuming an asteroidal reflectance implies an untenable interstellar object
mass per star. 3I/ATLAS exhibits an excess velocity of $v_\infty=58$ km/s
relative to the Sun which is significantly larger than that of 1I/`Oumuamua or
2I/Borisov. This velocity implies that 3I/ATLAS is relatively old in comparison
to previous interstellar objects. Here, we calculate the posterior distribution
of ages implied by the kinematics of the interstellar objects and find that
3I/ATLAS is likely $\sim3-11$ Gyr old, assuming that the interstellar object
and stellar age-velocity relations are equivalent. We also calculate the
distribution of host star metallicities and find that 3I/ATLAS likely
originated in a lower-metallicity system than the previous interstellar
objects. These results show that interstellar object formation is likely
efficient at low metallicities and early in the history of the Galaxy. Finally,
we estimate and approximate interstellar object formation rate throughout
Galactic history implied by these three objects.

Result: 热引力子能量密度在温暴胀中比相同再加热温度下的辐射主导情景增强约一到两个数量级。

Abstract: In warm inflation (WI), the persistent thermal bath that is sustained by
dissipative interactions with the inflaton field produces a stochastic
background of gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper we study the production
and evolution of these GWs. Specifically, we investigate the emission of
thermal gravitons (gravitons emitted by a thermal bath) from particle
scattering in the bath and the evolution of the corresponding GWs. We find that
the bulk of thermal graviton production in WI occurs during the transition to
radiation domination after inflation. Further, the energy density of thermal
gravitons is enhanced by roughly one to two orders of magnitude compared to
that in a radiation-dominated scenario with the same reheating temperature. We
also calculate the spectrum of the resulting stochastic GW background and find
that it has a distinctive shape, consisting of a peak at high frequencies ~100
GHz and an almost flat spectrum extending to low frequencies. The peak arises
from emission of sub-horizon modes that follow the temperature of the bath. The
flat part of the spectrum corresponds to the modes that exit the horizon during
WI and re-enter during radiation domination. We show that the detection
prospects for the high-frequency peak of the GW spectrum, while improved
slightly compared to the radiation-dominated case, still remain challenging.
The thermal spectrum's low-frequency plateau is typically subdominant to the
amplitude of the standard vacuum tensor modes from inflation, although WI
models can exist where the thermal graviton plateau surpasses the vacuum
contribution without exceeding current observational limits on the
tensor-to-scalar ratio. Furthermore, we calculate the thermal graviton
contribution from WI to dark radiation and show that WI models are generally
expected to satisfy current observational bounds, including those from the
cosmic microwave background.

Abstract: As ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors improve in sensitivity,
gravitational-wave background (GWB) signals will progressively become
detectable. Currently, searches for the GWB model the signal as a power law,
however deviations from this model will be relevant at increased sensitivity.
Therefore, to prepare for the range of potentially detectable GWB signals, we
propose an interpolation model implemented through a transdimensional
reverse-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm. This interpolation
model foregoes a specific physics-informed model (of which there are a great
many) in favor of a flexible model that can accurately recover a broad range of
potential signals. In this paper, we employ this framework for an array of GWB
applications. We present three dimensionless fractional GW energy density
injections and recoveries as examples of the capabilities of this spline
interpolation model. We further demonstrate how our model can be implemented
for hierarchical GW analysis on $\Omega_{\rm GW}$.

Background: 探讨无质量标量场细管（TToMSF）气体状态方程参数w对宇宙加速膨胀能力的影响及其在缓解物质分布不均和结构增长观测矛盾中的作用。

Result: 质量无标量场细管气体可通过局部状态方程的不同参数值缓解宇宙物质分布不均和结构增长带来的张力。

Abstract: In this work, we investigated the influence of constants that characterize
the motion of thin tubes of a massless scalar field (TToMSF) in a gas on the
global properties of such a gas, in particular, on its ability to accelerated
expansion. The peculiarity of the TToMSF gas is related to the fact that the
parameter of its equation of state $w$ depends on the degree of rarefaction of
the gas and can take values in a very wide range of values $-1< w <1$. In this
case, fluctuations in the density of the TToMSF gas, caused by its
gravitational interaction with non-uniformly distributed baryonic matter,
should lead to the implementation of local equations of state with different
values and different laws of change of the parameter $w$. The possibility of
implementing local equations of state can alleviate the tensions associated
with the observed non-uniformity of the distribution of matter and the growth
of structures in the Universe.

Background: 探讨量子效应如何影响早期宇宙的宇宙学动力学并保持时空结构的一致性。

Data: 使用 loop quantum cosmology 中的新有效弗里德曼方程和新的微扰不均匀性版本进行理论模拟。

Method: 采用新的有效弗里德曼方程和微扰非均匀性方法分析量子宇宙动力学。

Result: 当前模型要么与一致的时空结构不相容，要么存在物理奇点；新有效弗里德曼方程显示在亚普朗克密度下出现反弹，其前存在类似时间反转大撕裂的无限尺度因子奇点，整个过程伴随哈勃半径快速变化；同时提出了一种保持时空结构一致且背景动力学无奇点的新版微扰非均匀性。

Abstract: Quantum effects are expected to modify the cosmological dynamics of the early
universe while maintaining some (potentially discrete) notion of space-time
structure. In one approach, loop quantum cosmology, current models are shown
here to either be incompatible with a consistent space-time structure, or to
have physical singularities. The latter happens in spite of a non-zero scale
factor in the isotropic background dynamics. A new effective Friedmann equation
shows that a bounce is obtained at sub-Planckian densities, preceded by a
physical singularity at infinite scale factor that resembles a time-reversed
big rip. The entire phase is accompanied by rapid changes of the Hubble radius.
In addition, a new version of perturbative inhomogeneity in loop quantum
cosmology is introduced that maintains a consistent space-time structure and
has a non-singular background dynamics.

Result: 在早期宇宙中，标量度规扰动通过破坏共形平坦性诱导了引力子量子产生，由此产生的引力波信号在GHz频段达到峰值。

Abstract: A variety of mechanisms in the early Universe lead to the generation of
gravitational waves (GWs). We introduce here a novel source of GWs generated by
vacuum fluctuations after inflation. Being gravitons minimally coupled
particles, their quantum creation takes place during inflation, but is absent
in an unperturbed Universe during the radiation-dominated epoch, since they
behave as conformally invariant particles. However, the presence of
inhomogeneities breaks the conformal flatness of the metric, allowing scalar
metric perturbations to induce the quantum production of gravitons. We compute
the resulting GW spectrum from this mechanism for different models of the
primordial scalar power spectrum. We find that this GW signal peaks around the
GHz frequency range, distinguishing it from other astrophysical and
cosmological backgrounds and underscoring the need for detectors sensitive to
these high frequencies.

Abstract: We introduce a machine learning (ML) framework called $\texttt{TIER}$ for
improving the sensitivity of gravitational wave search pipelines. Typically,
search pipelines only use a small region of strain data in the vicinity of a
candidate signal to construct the detection statistic. However, extended strain
data ($\sim 10$ s) in the candidate's vicinity can also carry valuable
complementary information. We show that this information can be efficiently
captured by ML classifier models trained on sparse summary
representation/features of the extended data. Our framework is easy to train
and can be used with already existing candidates from any search pipeline, and
without requiring expensive injection campaigns. Furthermore, the output of our
model can be easily integrated into the detection statistic of a search
pipeline. Using $\texttt{TIER}$ on triggers from the $\texttt{IAS-HM}$
pipeline, we find up to $\sim 20\%$ improvement in sensitive volume time in
LIGO-Virgo-Kagra O3 data, with improvements concentrated in regions of high
masses and unequal mass ratios. Applying our framework increases the
significance of several near-threshold gravitational-wave candidates,
especially in the pair-instability mass gap and intermediate-mass black hole
(IMBH) ranges.

Abstract: Searches for astrophysical neutrino sources in IceCube rely on an unbinned
likelihood that consists of an energy and spatial component. Accurate modeling
of the detector, ice, and spatial distributions leads to improved directional
and energy reconstructions, resulting in increased sensitivity. In this work,
we utilize our best knowledge of the detector ice properties and detector
calibrations to reconstruct in-ice particle showers. The spatial component of
the likelihood is parameterized either by a 2D Gaussian or a von Mises Fisher
(vMF) distribution at small and large angular uncertainties, respectively.
Here, we use a gradient-boosted decision tree with a vMF spatial likelihood
loss function, reparameterized through two coordinate transformations, to
predict per-event point spread functions (PSF). Additionally, we discuss the
search for PeV cosmic ray sources using the IceCube Multi-Flavor Astrophysical
Neutrino (ICEMAN) sample. Our search contains both an analysis of individual
neutrino sources coincident with greater than 100 TeV gamma-ray sources and
also a stacking analysis. We outline the prospects for extended neutrino
emission originating from the Cygnus Cocoon region.

Abstract: The discovery of quasars and their supermassive black holes (SMBHs) over
$10^{9} M_{\odot}$ merely hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang
generates tension with the idea of Eddington-limited accretion and pressures
the community into exploring the concept of massive black hole seeds and/or
super-Eddington accretion. The observation that many black holes have reached
supermassive status while obeying the Eddington limit is puzzling as accretion
models are not spherically symmetric. We address this issue by illustrating the
physics behind a picture of inner disk accretion involving a geometrically
thick, hot quasi-spherical flow and argue that such an inner region provides
the radiation that instantiates the Eddington limit. Given the energetics of
the inner disk edge, we show how the characteristic electron cross-section
drops below its Thomson value, allowing black holes to grow rapidly despite
being Eddington-limited. Indeed, after implementing a modified cross-section
calculated via the Klein-Nishina Formula, we find that SMBH formation time
drops by up to $47\%$. In this context, we show how a $10^{9} M_{\odot}$ black
hole can form from a seed $10 M_{\odot}$ black hole within $500$ Myr by way of
accretion and mergers. While our picture is over-simplified and contrived in a
number of ways that we discuss, we suggest that our scenario is interesting in
that it offers a solution to two issues at the intersection of astrophysics and
cosmology, namely the reason the Eddington limit is obeyed and how some black
holes have grown rapidly despite that limit.

Abstract: The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) consists of 153 autonomous antenna
stations deployed over 17 km^2 to measure the radio emission from extensive air
showers initiated by cosmic rays with energies between 0.1 and 10 EeV in the 30
to 80 MHz frequency band. It operates in coincidence with the other detectors
of the Pierre Auger Observatory particularly the Surface Detector (SD) and the
Fluorescence Detector (FD). As the largest cosmic-ray radio detector worldwide
before the recent Observatory upgrade AugerPrime, AERA has played a pioneering
role in the development of radio technique for cosmic rays, providing
complementary measurements and serving as a testbed for ideas that motivated
the build-up of a new Radio Detector (RD) as part of AugerPrime. We report on
measurements of the depth of the shower maximum using the radio footprint,
demonstrating compatibility and competitive resolution with established FD
results. An absolute calibration of AERA is achieved by monitoring the sidereal
modulation of the diffuse Galactic radio emission for nearly a decade,
confirming the long-term stability of a radio detector with no significant
aging effects observed. This stability suggests that radio detectors could also
be used to monitor potential aging effects in other detector systems.
Additionally, we investigate the muon content of inclined air showers using
hybrid SD-AERA events. Our results indicate that the muon content in measured
data is consistent with expectations for iron nuclei as predicted by
current-generation hadronic interaction models, confirming the well-known muon
deficit for the first time with radio data. These findings reinforce the value
of radio detection for cosmic-ray studies and provide a foundation for the next
generation of analyses with the AugerPrime RD.

Abstract: The interaction of cosmic rays with celestial bodies such as the Moon or the
Sun produces a shadow in the arrival direction distribution of the cosmic rays
reaching the Earth. Such deficits from an isotropic flux have been observed by
astroparticle observatories below energies of $10^{15}\,$eV. Above this energy,
measurements were limited due to the low number of events as a result of the
steeply falling cosmic-ray flux with energy. With more than 10.6 million events
recorded during 20 years of operation of the Pierre Auger Observatory, we
report the first observation of the shadow of the Moon at an average energy of
$7\times10^{17}\,$eV with a maximum significance above 3$\sigma$. The shadow is
an end-to-end check that the celestial directions are correctly reconstructed
from the air shower data, and it is used here to derive the effective angular
resolution for this dataset. Additionally, we present the results of a similar
study on the shadow of the Sun.

### [58] [Evaluating the Limits of Rotation Period Recovery through Gyrochronology Criteria](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08266)

**TL;DR**: 提出基于陀螺年代学约束的方法，利用宽双星系统验证并可靠提取TESS光变曲线中受污染恒星的自转周期，发现短于8天的周期恢复率较高而超过10天的周期难以准确测定。

Background: 研究恒星自转周期测量中因邻近光源污染导致的信号混淆问题，并探索利用宽双星系统的天体物理约束（如陀螺年代学）来提高周期检测的可靠性。

Result: 利用陀螺年代学约束识别出成分间年龄一致的周期组合，有效分离真实自转信号。

Abstract: Contamination from nearby sources often compromises stellar rotation periods
derived from photometric light curves, particularly in data with large pixel
scales such as TESS. This problem is compounded when both the target and
contaminant are intrinsically variable, a scenario that challenges deblending
algorithms, which often assume constant contaminants. We assess the reliability
of rotation period detections using wide binary systems, whose components share
a common age and rotational history. By applying gyrochronology constraints, we
identify period combinations that yield consistent ages between components,
helping to isolate true rotation signals. Simulating blends with degraded
Kepler data, our method recovers correct rotation periods with an 88\% success
rate for periods $<12$ days, where TESS detections are most reliable. Applying
this framework to nearly 300 wide binaries observed by TESS, we find that
despite significant contamination, a subset of pairs shows consistent
gyrochronological ages. We establish a practical detection threshold for TESS
blended observations, finding that periods shorter than $\sim8$ days are
reliably recovered, while those longer than $\sim10$ days become significantly
more challenging and often remain unresolved. As expected, rotation periods are
more often recovered when the highest-amplitude periodogram peak is linked to
the brighter star and the second to the dimmer star, although many cases
deviate from this pattern, indicating it cannot always be assumed. Our results
highlight the limitations of standard deblending methods and demonstrate that
astrophysical constraints, such as gyrochronology, provide a valuable tool for
extracting reliable rotation periods from complex photometric blends.

Abstract: We present Hubble Space Telescope far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectra of a
blue-lurker$-$white-dwarf (BL-WD) binary system in the 4 Gyr open cluster M67.
We fit the FUV spectrum of the WD, determining it is a C/O WD with a mass of
$0.72^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ M$_\odot$ and a cooling age of $\sim400$ Myr. This
requires a WD progenitor of $\sim3$ M$_\odot$, significantly larger than the
current cluster turnoff mass of 1.3 M$_\odot$. We suggest the WD progenitor
star formed several hundred Myr ago via the merger of two stars near the
turnoff of the cluster. In this scenario, the original progenitor system was a
hierarchical triple consisting of a close, near-equal-mass inner binary, with a
tertiary companion with an orbit of a few thousand days. The WD is descended
from the merged inner binary, and the original tertiary is now the observed BL.
The likely formation scenario involves a common envelope while the WD
progenitor is on the AGB, and thus the observed orbital period of 359 days
requires an efficient common envelope ejection. The rapid rotation of the BL
indicates it accreted some material during its evolution, perhaps via a wind
prior to the common envelope. This system will likely undergo a second common
envelope in the future, and thus could result in a short-period double WD
binary or merger of a 0.72 M$_\odot$ C/O WD and a 0.38 $M_\odot$ Helium WD,
making this a potential progenitor of an interesting transient such as a
sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernova.

Abstract: Context. Star formation and, in particular, high-mass star formation are key
astrophysical processes that are far from being fully understood.
Unfortunately, progress in these fields is slow because observations are hard
to interpret as they cannot be directly compared to numerical simulations.
Synthetic observations are therefore necessary to better constrain the models.
Aims. With the Rosetta Stone project, we aim to develop an end-to-end pipeline
to compare star formation simulations with observations as accurately as
possible in order to study the evolution from clumps scales to stars.
  Methods. Using the adaptive mesh-refinement code RAMSES, we computed a first
grid of model of star-forming clumps to develop our pipeline and explore the
impact of the clump initial conditions on their evolution. The main purpose of
this set of simulations is to be converted into synthetic observations to
enable a direct comparison with real star-forming clumps observed with Herschel
and ALMA.
  Results. The Rosetta Stone simulations presented here provide a catalog
available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with observations
(RS1). Among all the parameters explored here, the strength of the magnetic
field has the strongest influence on the clump evolution (fragmentation, star
formation, global collapse) at both large and small scales. Numerical
parameters such as the resolution per Jeans length or the threshold for
accretion onto sink particles affects the formation of low-mass sinks. Finally,
the widely used L/M ratio is found to be a good indicator of the clump
evolutionary state regardless of its initial condition, but this could change
when more feedback processes (jets, HII regions) are included.
  Conclusions. We now have a new suite of simulations of star-forming clumps
that is available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with the
observations,

Result: 中子星合并是已确认的r过程核合成场所之一，但早期宇宙中可能存在其他来源来解释古老恒星中的r过程元素特征。

Abstract: The rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) is responsible for the creation
of roughly half of the elements heavier than iron, including precious metals
like silver, gold, and platinum, as well as radioactive elements such as
thorium and uranium. Despite its importance, the nature of the astrophysical
sites where the r-process occurs, and the detailed mechanisms of its formation,
remain elusive. The key to resolving these mysteries lies in the study of
chemical signatures preserved in ancient, metal-poor stars. In this review, we
explore r-process nucleosynthesis, focusing on the sites, progenitors, and
formation mechanisms. We discuss the role of potential astrophysical sites such
as neutron star mergers, core-collapse supernovae, magneto-rotational
supernovae, and collapsars, that can play a key role in producing the heavy
elements. We also highlight the importance of studying these signatures through
high-resolution spectroscopic surveys, stellar archaeology, and multi-messenger
astronomy. Recent advancements, such as the gravitational wave event GW170817
and detection of the r-process in the ejecta of its associated kilonovae, have
established neutron star mergers as one of the confirmed sites. However,
questions remain regarding whether they are the only sites that could have
contributed in early epochs or if additional sources are needed to explain the
signatures of r-process found in the oldest stars. Additionally, there are
strong indications pointing towards additional sources of r-process-rich nuclei
in the context of Galactic evolutionary timescales. This review summarizes what
has been learned so far, the challenges that remain, and the exciting prospects
for future discoveries. The increasing synergy between observational
facilities, computational models, and large-scale surveys is poised to
transform our understanding of r-process nucleosynthesis in the coming years.
