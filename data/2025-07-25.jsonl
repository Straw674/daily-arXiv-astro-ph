The implications of these early galaxies for reionization\nare less clear, however. The CMB is one of the few windows into the ionization\nstate of the IGM during reionization's first half, providing an important probe\nof the ionizing photon sources at those times. Meanwhile, measurements of the\nLyman-$\\alpha$ forest in the spectra of high-$z$ quasars have improved to the\nlevel of tightly constraining the timing of reionization's end. In this paper,\nwe use radiative transfer simulations to explore how measurements of the patchy\nkinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich (pkSZ) effect, when combined with Lyman-$\\alpha$\nforest measurements, can be used to constrain the early stages of reionization\nand the nature of its sources. For a given source model, we find that the\namplitude of the pkSZ power spectra strongly correlates with the start time of\nreionization, and constrains the number of ionizing photons produced by the\nhigh-$z$ source population. Allowing for variations in the source model, this\ncorrelation is weakened by a degeneracy between the reionization history and\nthe effects of source clustering. However, we demonstrate two potential ways of\nbreaking this degeneracy using: (1) measurements of large-scale fluctuations in\nthe Ly$\\alpha$ forest opacity at $z=5-6$, and/or; (2) the shape of the pkSZ\npower spectrum measured in future CMB surveys. Models with highly clustered\nsources yield steeper slopes in the pkSZ power around $\\ell = 3,000$, so\nmeasurements at additional angular scales can be used to break the\nhistory-clustering degeneracy.

Previous studies indicate that the bar strength depends on\n$m_{\\mathrm{d}}$ as $\\propto m_{\\mathrm{d}}^{-1}$, which is seen as a delay in\nbar formation.

The role of disc mass is as\nfollows: increasing $m_{\\mathrm{d}}$ for moderate $\\epsilon$ ($\\geq 10\\,$pc)\nreduces the amount of drift in the acceleration profile, without affecting the\nbar's behaviour. Models with lower $m_{\\mathrm{d}}$ values coupled with small\nsoftening values, have an excess of highly accelerated particles, introducing\nunwanted effects into otherwise reliable simulations.

The\ncombination of complementary probes in terms of parameter degeneracies and\nsystematics is key to achieving these ambitious scientific goals. In this\ncontext, determining the optimal survey configuration for an analysis that\ncombines galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing, the\nso-called 3x2pt analysis, remains an open problem. In this paper, we present an\nefficient and flexible end-to-end pipeline to optimise the sample selection for\n3x2pt analyses in an automated way. Our pipeline is articulated in two main\nsteps: we first consider a self-organising map to determine the photometric\nredshifts of a simulated galaxy sample. As a proof of method for stage-IV\nsurveys, we use samples from the DESC Data Challenge 2 catalogue. This allows\nus to classify galaxies into tomographic bins based on their colour phenotype\nclustering. We then explore different redshift-bin edge configurations for weak\nlensing only as well as 3x2pt analyses in a novel way. Our method explores\nmultiple configurations of perturbed redshift-bin edges with respect to the\nfiducial case in an iterative manner. In particular, we sample tomographic\nconfigurations for the source and lens galaxies separately. We show that, using\nthis method we quickly converge into an optimised configuration for different\nnumbers of redshift bins and cosmologies. Our analysis demonstrates that for\nstage-IV surveys an optimal tomographic sample selection can increase the\nfigure of merit of the dark energy (DE) equation of state by a factor of\n$\\sim$2, comparable to an effective increase in survey area of $\\sim$4 for\nnon-optimal photometric survey analyses."}

In\nthis paper, we present technical improvements to the method and apply it to\nspin $a_*=0.9$ BHs, which power relativistic jets.

The precision\nand scale of astrometric datasets make them well-suited for searching for a\nstochastic gravitational wave background, whose signature appears in the\ntwo-point correlation function of the deflection field across the sky. Although\nGaia achieves high accuracy in measuring angular separations in its focal\nplane, systematic uncertainties in the satellite's absolute orientation limit\nthe precision of absolute position measurements. These orientation errors can\nbe mitigated by focusing on relative angles between star pairs, which\neffectively cancel out common-mode orientation noise. In this work, we compute\nthe astrometric response and the overlap reduction functions for this relative\nastrometry approach, correcting previous expressions presented in the\nliterature. We use a Fisher matrix analysis to compare the sensitivity of\nrelative astrometry to that of conventional absolute astrometry. Our analysis\nshows that while the relative method is theoretically sound, its sensitivity is\nlimited for closely spaced star pairs within a single Gaia field of view. Pairs\nwith large angular separations could provide competitive sensitivity, but are\npractically inaccessible due to Gaia's scanning law. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat combining astrometric data with observations from pulsar timing arrays\nleads to slight improvements in sensitivity at frequencies greater than\napproximately 10^-7 Hz."}

We show that the\nsame sterile neutrino species can naturally emerge with multiple population\ncomponents, yielding a multi-modal relic momentum spectrum. We consider this\nwith four distinct production scenarios: active-sterile non-resonant\noscillations following resonant oscillations in the presence of a primordial\nlepton asymmetry, gravitational production through sterile neutrinogenesis from\npopulations of evaporating primordial black holes, and heavy singlet Higgs or\ninflaton decays combined with non-resonant active-sterile oscillations or\nneutrinogenesis. We identify sterile neutrino mass ranges where a colder and a\nhotter population can be present with similar contributions and can also\ncontribute non-negligibly to the dark matter relic abundance. We discuss some\npotential consequences of such a multi-population framework."}

In this paper, we study two such possible deviations: a\ntime variation of Newton's constant $G$ and the emission of dipolar\ngravitational radiation. We use updated data for some well-known pulsars,\nnamely PSR J1738+0333, PSR J1012+5307, and PSR J1713+0747, to extract the\nKeplerian and post-Keplerian parameters that characterize their orbital\ndynamics, using recent high-precision pulsar timing data and a Bayesian\nparameter estimation with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. We do\nthis via the TEMPO2 software, the MCMC4Tempo2 plugin, and a unified python\npipeline to analyze the data. We then perform a combined analysis of different\nbinary systems to constrain both the time evolution of Newton's constant and\nthe dipolar emission parameter $\\kappa_D$. For the best of our three pulsars\n(PSR J1713+0747), we obtain $\\dot{G}/G = (0.32 \\pm 0.31) \\times\n10^{-12}~\\text{yr}^{-1}$ at 95\\% confidence, along with a stringent constraint\non the dipolar emission parameter, $\\kappa_D = (-0.04 \\pm 0.14) \\times\n10^{-4}$. Thanks to the recent high-precision timing data sets, we provide\nupdated bounds on key parameters relevant to modified gravity theories, and we\nfind that our results are consistent with GR."}

Specifically, it is known that at the foam\nlevel, topologically non-trivial solutions such as instantons appear. In the\nparticular case of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, we obtain an effective\ndynamical dark energy term proportional to the instanton density, and the\nlatter can be easily calculated through standard techniques. Hence, we can\nimmediately extract the differential equation that determines the evolution of\nthe topologically induced effective dark energy density. Significantly, this\nTDE scenario allows for changing sign of dark energy during the cosmic\nevolution and also exhibits Dark Energy interaction with Dark Matter. We\nconfront the TDE scenario, in both flat and non-flat cases, with\nPantheon+/SH0ES Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa), Baryonic Accoustic Oscillations\n(BAO), and Cosmic Chronometers (CC) datasets. By applying standard model\nselection methods (AIC and DevIC information criteria), we find a moderate but\nstatistically significant preference over $\\Lambda$CDM scenario. Finally, we\nshow that the TDE scenario passes constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis\n(BBN) and thus does not spoil the thermal history of the Universe."}

Galaxies are classified as residing in sheets, filaments, or clusters\nbased on the eigenvalues of the tidal tensor derived from the smoothed density\nfield. The quenched fraction increases with stellar mass and is highest in\nclusters, intermediate in filaments, and lowest in sheets, reflecting the\nincreasing efficiency of environmental quenching with density. A flattening of\nthe quenched fraction beyond $\\log_{10}(M_\\star/M_\\odot) \\sim 10.6$ across all\nenvironments signals a transition from environment-driven to mass-driven\nquenching. In contrast, the bulge fraction continues to rise beyond this\nthreshold, indicating a decoupling between star formation suppression and\nmorphological transformation. At the high-mass end ($\\log_{10}(M_\\star/M_\\odot)\n\\gtrsim 11.5$), both quenched and bulge fractions bifurcate, increasing in\nclusters but declining in sheets, suggesting a divergent evolutionary pathway\nwhere massive galaxies in sheets retain cold gas and disk-like morphologies,\npotentially sustaining or rejuvenating star formation. The AGN fraction also\nincreases with stellar mass and is somewhat higher in sheets than in clusters,\nindicating enhanced AGN activity in low-density, gas-rich environments. The\nhigh-mass trends are independently corroborated by our analysis of specific\nstar formation rate, $(u-r)$ colour, concentration index, and D4000 in the\nstellar mass-density plane, which show that massive galaxies in sheets remain\nbluer, younger, more star-forming, and structurally less evolved than their\ncluster counterparts. Our results highlight the cosmic web as an active driver\nof galaxy evolution."}
