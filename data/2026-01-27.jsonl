Among competing models, the collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos provide a plausible explanation for early SMBH formation. While previous studies on modeling the gravothermal collapse of SIDM halos have primarily focused on non-relativistic evolution under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, We advance this framework by relaxing the equilibrium assumption and additionally incorporating general-relativistic effects. To this end, we introduce the Misner-Sharp formalism to the SIDM context for the first time. Our model reproduces the standard hydrostatic models in the early long-mean-free-path (LMFP) regime, but displays interesting distinct behavior in the late short-mean-free-path (SMFP) regime, where intense outward heat flux drives a rapid expansion of the outer envelope, removing mass from the core and significantly decelerating the collapse. Our general relativistic treatment enables us to follow halo evolution to the final stage when the apparent horizon forms. Our simulation yields a seed black hole mass of approximately $3\\times10^{-8}$ of the halo mass at horizon formation, suggesting that additional mechanisms such as baryonic effects are critical for seeding black holes that are sufficiently massive to account for SMBHs in the early Universe."}

The rest is dark matter, which does not emit or absorb light but plays a fundamental role in galaxy and structure evolution. Because it interacts only through gravity, one of the most direct probes is weak gravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by intervening mass. Here we present an extremely detailed, wide-area weak-lensing mass map, covering 0.77 deg x 0.70 deg, using high-resolution imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as part of the COSMOS-Web survey. By measuring the shapes of 129 galaxies per square arcminute-many independently in the F115W and F150W bands-we achieve an angular resolution of 1.00 +/- 0.01 arcmin. Our map has more than twice the resolution of earlier Hubble Space Telescope maps, revealing how dark and luminous matter co-evolve across filaments, clusters, and under-densities. It traces mass features out to z ~ 2, including the most distant structure at z ~ 1.1. The sensitivity to high-redshift lensing constrains galaxy environments at the peak of cosmic star formation and sets a high-resolution benchmark for testing theories about the nature of dark matter and the formation of large-scale cosmic structure"}

These theories lead to the formation of dense dark matter structures known as minihalos, which provide insights into early Universe dynamics and have implications for direct detection experiments. We examine the mass loss of minihalos during stellar encounters, building on previous studies that derived formulas for mass loss and performed N-body simulations. We propose a new formula for the mass loss that accounts for changes in the minihalo profile after disruption by a passing star. We also investigate the mass loss for multiple stellar encounters. We demonstrate that accurately assessing the mass loss in minihalos due to multiple stellar encounters necessitates considering the alterations in the minihalo's binding energy after each encounter, as overlooking this aspect results in a substantial underestimation of the mass loss.\n  We further extend our analysis to the Galactic environment by more accurately incorporating multiple stellar encounters and dynamical relaxation timescales, simulating minihalo orbits in the Galactic potential. Our results show stellar interactions are more destructive than previously estimated, reducing minihalo mass retention at the solar system to ~30%, compared to earlier estimates of ~60%. This enhanced loss arises from cumulative energy injections when relaxation periods between stellar encounters are accounted for. The altered minihalo mass function implies a larger fraction of axion dark matter occupies inter-minihalo space, potentially increasing the local axion density and improving haloscope detection prospects. This thesis highlights the significance of detailed modeling of stellar disruptions in shaping the axion dark matter distribution."}

We aim to investigate the connection between star formation histories (SFHs) and the inner dark matter density profiles of simulated galaxies. In particular, we test whether the burstiness and temporal distribution of star formation influence the formation of cored versus cuspy dark matter profiles. Methods. We homogeneously analysed simulated galaxies from the NIHAO and FIRE-2 projects. For each galaxy, we derived dark matter density profiles and measured the logarithmic slope in the inner region of the dark matter halo (1-2% of R$_{\\rm vir}$). To characterise star formation burstiness, we introduced a criterion based on comparing the star formation rate (SFR) averaged over two distinct timescales. We further quantified the duration of SFHs by computing $M_{\\star, \\rm post}$ / $M_{\\star, \\rm pre}$, the ratio of stellar mass formed after versus before the epoch of reionisation at redshift z $\\sim$ 6.5. Results. Homogeneous analysis reveals that inner slope versus stellar-to-halo mass ratio trends for NIHAO and FIRE-2 galaxies are in much better agreement than reported in previous works. The burstiness and duration of the SFH explain the scatter in the inner slope versus stellar-to-halo mass ratio relation, revealing that galaxies with above average burstiness and more extended SFHs are more efficient at developing cored dark matter profiles. In contrast, galaxies with smoother SFHs and earlier stellar mass assembly tend to maintain cuspier dark matter profiles. We present an analytic expression that improves predictions for the inner slope using the parameter $M_{\\star \\rm,post}$ / $M_{\\star \\rm,pre}$, which reduces the mean squared error in both simulation suites relative to previous formulations based solely on the stellar-to-halo mass ratio."}

Submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "We present an improved semi-analytical model to predict density profiles of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos and apply it to constrain the self-scattering cross section using SPARC galaxy rotation curves. Building on the isothermal Jeans approach, our model incorporates (i) velocity-dependent cross sections, (ii) an empirical treatment of core collapse, and (iii) enhanced robustness for identifying solutions. These advances allow us to fit a large sample of galaxies, including systems with baryon-dominated centers often excluded in earlier studies. We find that roughly 1/6 of galaxies admit both a core-growth and a core-collapse solution, while the rest favor a unique evolutionary state. Joint constraints across the sample reveal clear velocity dependence: the allowed parameter space forms an L-shaped degeneracy, where both nearly constant, low cross sections ($σ_0\\sim2\\,{\\rm cm}^2$/g, $ω\\gtrsim500\\,$km/s) and strongly velocity-dependent models ($σ_0\\sim100\\,{\\rm cm}^2$/g, $ω\\sim60\\,$km/s) are viable. Adopting the core-growth interpretation yields best-fit values $σ_0\\simeq5\\,{\\rm cm}^2$/g and $ω\\simeq250\\,$km/s. Our constraints are remarkably consistent with previous results derived from a variety of independent probes. Compared to cold dark matter (CDM) models, SIDM outperforms simple adiabatic-contraction profiles and rivals empirical feedback-based CDM profiles, yet shows no correlation with stellar-to-halo mass ratio, a proxy for feedback strength, offering a distinct explanation for dwarf galaxy diversity. Moreover, SIDM does not affect galaxy-halo scaling relations significantly and makes concentration systematically lower. Our results highlight SIDM as a compelling framework for small-scale structure, while future low-mass kinematic data will be crucial for breaking degeneracies in velocity-dependent cross-section models."}

We compare the full EFT to several other models: a version neglecting the velocity-shear term, the non-linear alignment model (NLA), and to a reduced EFT assuming co-evolution relations that follow from the assumption that alignment is linear in Lagrangian space. The first two models yield biased constraints on the alignment amplitude, but the reduced EFT performs remarkably well, achieving a low reduced chi-squared and minimal bias. We examine the redshift and mass dependence of the higher-order bias parameters, finding that the linear Lagrangian bias assumption is approximately satisfied across the explored halo mass and redshift ranges for both galaxies and haloes, suggesting that the galaxies broadly follow the alignment properties of their host haloes. These co-evolution relations can be valuable for photometric shear surveys, where limited constraining power on IA parameters favours models with fewer free parameters."}

Most of the mass in and around it is believed to be dark matter rather than gas or stars, so its distribution must be inferred from the effect of gravity on the motion of visible objects. Modelling efforts have long struggled to reproduce the quiet Hubble flow around the Local Group, as they require unrealistically little mass beyond the haloes of the two main galaxies. Here we revisit this using $Λ$CDM simulations of Local Group analogues with initial conditions constrained to match the observed dynamics of the two main haloes and the surrounding flow. The observations are reconcilable within $Λ$CDM, but only if mass is strongly concentrated in a plane out to 10 Mpc, with the surface density rising away from the Local Group and with deep voids above and below. This configuration, dynamically inferred, mirrors known structures in the nearby galaxy distribution. The resulting Hubble flow is quiet yet strongly anisotropic, a fact obscured by the paucity of tracers at high supergalactic latitude. This flattened geometry reconciles the dynamical mass estimates of the Local Group with the surrounding velocity field, thus demonstrating full consistency within the standard cosmological model."}

If the horizon entanglement entropy falls slightly below the Bekenstein-Hawking value, we parametrize the shortfall by a fractional deficit $δ(a)$ evolving with the FLRW scale factor $a$. The associated equipartition deficit at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature then sources a smooth, homogeneous component whose density scales as $H^{2}/G$, with a dimensionless coefficient $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ of order unity times $δ(a)$. Because this component tracks $H^{2}$, it is negligible at early times but can activate at redshifts $z\\lesssim 1$, raising the late time expansion rate by a few percent without affecting recombination or the sound horizon. We present a minimal three parameter activation model for $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ and derive its impact on the background expansion, effective equation of state, and linear growth for a smooth entanglement sector. The framework predicts a small boost in $H(z)$, a mild suppression of $fσ_{8}(z)$, and a corresponding modification of the low-$z$ distance-redshift relation. We test these predictions against current low-redshift data sets, including SN~Ia distance moduli, baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements, cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and redshift space distortion constraints, and discuss whether the $H_0$ tension can be consistently interpreted as a late-time, horizon-scale information deficit rather than an early universe modification."}

We derive global direct abundances of 12 + log(O/H) = 8.008 (+0.025, -0.027) for CANDELS 8005 and 7.89 (+0.027, -0.028) for CANDELS 7986. Emission-line diagnostics indicate neither galaxy hosts an active galactic nucleus. A first-order kinematic analysis suggests a potential merger in CANDELS 8005. The direct abundances agree with strong-line estimates from our data and recent high-redshift calibrations. We build emission line, radial velocity, strong-line abundance, electron temperature, and direct abundance maps for both galaxies. From these maps, we measure linear radial metallicity gradients of -0.111 (+0.026, -0.025) dex/kpc for CANDELS 8005 (statistically significant) and -0.093 +/- 0.088 dex/kpc for CANDELS 7986, where the large uncertainties limit significance. These results represent the first detection of a radial metallicity gradient from direct-method abundances with measurements taken in galaxies at z>0, supporting inside-out galaxy growth with feedback-regulated chemical enrichment."}

In this paper, we explore approaches to increase the applicability of machine learning models for photometric redshift estimation on a broader range of galaxy types. Typical models are trained with ground-truth redshifts from spectroscopy. We test the utility and effectiveness of two approaches for combining spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts derived from multiband ($\\sim$35 filters) photometry, which sample different types of galaxies compared to spectroscopic surveys. The two approaches are (1) training on a composite dataset and (2) transfer learning from one dataset to another. We compile photometric redshifts from the COSMOS2020 catalog (TransferZ) to complement an established spectroscopic redshift dataset (GalaxiesML). We used two architectures, deterministic neural networks (NN) and Bayesian neural networks (BNN), to examine and evaluate their performance with respect to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) photo-$z$ science requirements. We also use split conformal prediction for calibrating uncertainty estimates and producing prediction intervals for the BNN and NN, respectively. We find that a NN trained on a composite dataset predicts photo-$z$'s that are 4.5 times less biased within the redshift range $0.3<z<1.5$, 1.1 times less scattered, and has a 1.4 times lower outlier rate than a model trained on only spectroscopic ground truths. We also find that BNNs produce reliable uncertainty estimates, but are sensitive to the different ground truths. This investigation leverages different sources of ground truths to develop models that can accurately predict photo-$z$'s for a broader population of galaxies crucial for surveys such as Euclid and LSST."}

Variations in turbulence regime and density-magnetic-field alignment across the warm (WNM), unstable (UNM), and cold (CNM) neutral media should imprint distinct signatures on the power spectra and $EE/BB$ power ratio, yet the relative phase contributions remain poorly constrained. Using high-resolution 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a turbulent multiphase ISM coupled with synthetic dust polarization maps, we quantify phase-dependent turbulence, anisotropy, and alignment properties. We find that the trans-Alfvénic and transonic WNM and UNM are strongly anisotropic, exhibiting tight alignment of density and velocity structures with the local magnetic field. In contrast, the super-Alfvénic and supersonic CNM displays reduced anisotropy and weak alignment. These dynamical differences are reflected in the statistical scaling of fluctuations: the square root of the second-order velocity structure function exhibits a slope near $1/3$ in the WNM, near $1/2$ in the CNM, and intermediate in the UNM. Our synthetic observations reproduce the polarization power spectra measured by Planck. We find that polarization from UNM dust yields spectral indices most consistent with Planck, whereas WNM and CNM dust produce steeper and shallower spectra, respectively. The WNM yields $EE/BB>2$, the UNM gives $EE/BB\\sim2$, and the CNM yields $EE/BB\\approx1$. These results indicate that UNM dust could be the dominant contributor to the polarized foreground. We present predictions at 150 GHz to improve foreground separation."}

The hydrostatic mass and the mass obtained from gravitational lensing measurements generally differ, a discrepancy known as the hydrostatic mass bias. In this work, we derive the hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters within the framework of Rastall gravity and investigate its implications under two scenarios: (i) the absence of dark matter and (ii) the existence of dark matter. In the first scenario, Rastall gravity effectively reduces the hydrostatic mass, bringing it closer to the observed baryonic mass. The best linear fit yields a slope $\\mathbf{M}=1.07\\pm0.11$, indicating a near one-to-one correspondence between the two masses. In the second scenario, Rastall gravity helps to alleviate the hydrostatic mass bias. The linear fit between the Rastall hydrostatic mass and the observed lensing mass results in a best-fit slope $\\mathbf{M}=1.01\\pm0.16$, which is very close to unity. These results suggest that Rastall gravity provides a statistically favorable framework for addressing mass discrepancies in galaxy clusters."}

Our analysis demonstrates that SEDs with red optical and blue UV continua are very common in HRQs, with more than 82 per cent of the sample showing a UV-excess relative to the reddened quasar continuum. We model the SEDs by combining a reddened quasar and an unobscured scattered light component, though contributions from a star-forming host galaxy cannot be ruled out. The average scattering fraction is small (0.3 per cent). Higher scattering fractions are ruled out by the (i-K)=2.5 colour-cut used to select HRQs which pre-dates the discovery of the JWST \"Little Red Dot\" (LRD) population. Hence, LRDs generally have bluer UV continua. Nevertheless, four HRQs satisfy the LRD UV/optical continuum slope selections and are therefore massive, cosmic noon analogues of LRDs. Analysis of the near-infrared SEDs of HRQs reveals a deficit of hot dust relative to blue quasars, similar to what is observed in LRDs. This suggests HRQs trace a phase where strong AGN feedback processes eject dust from the inner torus. The UV scattering fraction of HRQs is weakly correlated with the amount of hot dust emission and anti-correlated with the line-of-sight extinction, E(B-V). This is consistent with the hot dust acting as the scattering medium, and the line-of-sight extinction being dominated by dust on interstellar medium scales in the host galaxy."}

To process, analyse and identify such large amounts of GW signals arising from mergers of Binary Black Holes (BBH), we need both speed and accuracy. In the search for (massive) BBH signals, the biggest hurdle is posed by the various non-gaussian noise transients called glitches. Compared to our previous work, which used a simple convolutional neural network to distinguish BBHs from Blip glitches, this work uses transfer learning with InceptionNetV3 to distinguish BBHs from six types of most popular glitches from the third observing run of LIGO. While the glitches are real and identified via GravitySpy, the BBH signals are simulated and then injected into the real detector noise for each of the two LIGO detectors. We generate Sine-Gaussian Projection (SGP) maps by cross-correlating data with Sine-Gaussian functions of varied quality factors ($Q$) and central frequencies ($f_0$) and projected on the $Q$ - $f_0$ plane. We find that SGP maps make it easier to distinguish BBHs from glitches that look very similar to BBHs in the Time-Frequency maps like the Blips, while also maintaining significant morphological differences between BBHs and the more frequent glitches - Scattered Light and Fast Scattering. Our network has an accuracy of $87%$, a TPR of 0.83 for an FPR of 0.1 on our test dataset. It is also robust, retaining its level of accuracy, when tested on real BBH events identified in the first three observing runs of LIGO. Our proposed method shows the viability of using the SGP maps and neural networks for fast identification of GW events improving the efficiency of standard search pipelines."}

In particular, for PBH masses following the critical collapse mass-scaling law with critical exponent $γ_\\mathrm{crit}$, with $γ_\\mathrm{crit} \\in (0.33, 0.49)$, the aforementioned radiative absorption mass growth mechanism produces a striking effect: PBHs forming with a mass $10^6M_\\odot$ during BBN can reach $\\mathcal{O}(10^{10} M_\\odot)$ within $\\mathcal{O}(10^{6} \\mathrm{s})$ ($\\sim $ 58 days).

The Schwarzschild treatment presented here can be extended to spherically symmetric cosmological black holes, indicating that radiative absorption is a dominant and previously overlooked PBH growth channel in the early Universe."}

By applying the halo mass function and halo bias, we convolve contributions from individual halos across a range of masses and redshifts to derive the large-scale structure contribution to the DM PDF. We validate our analytical predictions against consistency-check simulations and compare them with the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation across a range of redshifts up to $z = 5$, demonstrating excellent agreement.

Submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "We present an improved semi-analytical model to predict density profiles of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos and apply it to constrain the self-scattering cross section using SPARC galaxy rotation curves. Building on the isothermal Jeans approach, our model incorporates (i) velocity-dependent cross sections, (ii) an empirical treatment of core collapse, and (iii) enhanced robustness for identifying solutions. These advances allow us to fit a large sample of galaxies, including systems with baryon-dominated centers often excluded in earlier studies. We find that roughly 1/6 of galaxies admit both a core-growth and a core-collapse solution, while the rest favor a unique evolutionary state. Joint constraints across the sample reveal clear velocity dependence: the allowed parameter space forms an L-shaped degeneracy, where both nearly constant, low cross sections ($σ_0\\sim2\\,{\\rm cm}^2$/g, $ω\\gtrsim500\\,$km/s) and strongly velocity-dependent models ($σ_0\\sim100\\,{\\rm cm}^2$/g, $ω\\sim60\\,$km/s) are viable. Adopting the core-growth interpretation yields best-fit values $σ_0\\simeq5\\,{\\rm cm}^2$/g and $ω\\simeq250\\,$km/s. Our constraints are remarkably consistent with previous results derived from a variety of independent probes. Compared to cold dark matter (CDM) models, SIDM outperforms simple adiabatic-contraction profiles and rivals empirical feedback-based CDM profiles, yet shows no correlation with stellar-to-halo mass ratio, a proxy for feedback strength, offering a distinct explanation for dwarf galaxy diversity. Moreover, SIDM does not affect galaxy-halo scaling relations significantly and makes concentration systematically lower. Our results highlight SIDM as a compelling framework for small-scale structure, while future low-mass kinematic data will be crucial for breaking degeneracies in velocity-dependent cross-section models."}

Accepted", "summary": "Using a sample of $\\sim$126,000 late-type galaxies (LTGs) from SDSS, we analyzed stellar mass as a function of dynamical mass. Stellar masses were estimated using eight SPS models with constant IMFs, while dynamical masses were derived from seven formulations based on Newtonian dynamics and virial equilibrium, incorporating both stellar and gas velocity dispersions. We account for key factors affecting dynamical mass estimation, including inclination, colour, concentration, and Sérsic index. We find that the difference between dynamical and stellar mass ($Δ\\log \\mathbf{M}$) ranges from nearly zero to $\\sim$95% of the dynamical mass, depending on mass and redshift. $Δ\\log \\mathbf{M}$ appears to decreases with increasing redshift, but exhibits a saddle-like shape at low mass and low redshift-especially in disk-dominated LTGs-transitioning into a steep, linear trend at higher masses and redshifts. In the high-mass regime, the behavior resembles that of early-type galaxies. Moreover, our results indicate that this evolution is not discrete but follows a continuous transition between morphological regimes. Dark matter within LTGs is at most equal to $Δ\\log \\mathbf{M}$, depending on the impact of the IMF and SPS on stellar mass estimation. Although SPS-based stellar masses do not include the gas component, previous studies have shown that galaxies with log($\\mathbf{M_{Stellar}/M_{Solar}}) > 10$ at $z \\leq 0.3$ are predominantly stellar-mass dominated. Most galaxies in our sample fall within this regime, minimizing the impact of gas exclusion. Our findings go beyond the scope of single galaxies, providing insight into the nearby Universe and highlighting the influence of dark matter in determining the Universe's structure and evolution."}

When observed as fireballs in Earth's atmosphere, these properties can be inferred from their ablation and fragmentation behavior. The 2022 release of previously classified United States Government (USG) satellite sensor data has provided hundreds of new fireball light curves, allowing for more detailed analysis. Here we present a new Bayesian inference method based on dynamic nested sampling that can robustly estimate these objects' physical parameters from their observed light curves, starting from relatively uninformative, flat priors. We validate our method against seven USG sensor-observed fireballs with independent ground-based observations and demonstrate that our results are consistent with previous estimates. We then apply our technique to $13$ decameter-size Earth impactors to conduct the most detailed population-level study of their structure and material strength to date. We identify three structurally distinct groups within the decameter impactors. The first group are primarily structurally homogeneous, weak objects which catastrophically disrupt below $\\sim1.5$ MPa. The second group are heterogeneous objects which progressively fragment starting from $\\sim1$ MPa typically up to $\\sim3-8$ MPa. The third group are strong aggregates which remain mostly intact until $9-10$ MPa. Our results also suggest that decameter-size asteroids fragment in two distinct phases: an initial phase at $\\sim0.04-0.09$ MPa and a second at $\\sim1-4$ MPa. While decimeter- to meter-size objects typically lose most of their mass in the initial phase, larger decameter-size objects instead lose most of their mass in the second phase."}

Most of the mass in and around it is believed to be dark matter rather than gas or stars, so its distribution must be inferred from the effect of gravity on the motion of visible objects. Modelling efforts have long struggled to reproduce the quiet Hubble flow around the Local Group, as they require unrealistically little mass beyond the haloes of the two main galaxies. Here we revisit this using $Λ$CDM simulations of Local Group analogues with initial conditions constrained to match the observed dynamics of the two main haloes and the surrounding flow. The observations are reconcilable within $Λ$CDM, but only if mass is strongly concentrated in a plane out to 10 Mpc, with the surface density rising away from the Local Group and with deep voids above and below. This configuration, dynamically inferred, mirrors known structures in the nearby galaxy distribution. The resulting Hubble flow is quiet yet strongly anisotropic, a fact obscured by the paucity of tracers at high supergalactic latitude. This flattened geometry reconciles the dynamical mass estimates of the Local Group with the surrounding velocity field, thus demonstrating full consistency within the standard cosmological model."}

In this paper, we explore approaches to increase the applicability of machine learning models for photometric redshift estimation on a broader range of galaxy types.

We test the utility and effectiveness of two approaches for combining spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts derived from multiband ($\\sim$35 filters) photometry, which sample different types of galaxies compared to spectroscopic surveys. The two approaches are (1) training on a composite dataset and (2) transfer learning from one dataset to another. We compile photometric redshifts from the COSMOS2020 catalog (TransferZ) to complement an established spectroscopic redshift dataset (GalaxiesML). We used two architectures, deterministic neural networks (NN) and Bayesian neural networks (BNN), to examine and evaluate their performance with respect to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) photo-$z$ science requirements. We also use split conformal prediction for calibrating uncertainty estimates and producing prediction intervals for the BNN and NN, respectively. We find that a NN trained on a composite dataset predicts photo-$z$'s that are 4.5 times less biased within the redshift range $0.3<z<1.5$, 1.1 times less scattered, and has a 1.4 times lower outlier rate than a model trained on only spectroscopic ground truths. We also find that BNNs produce reliable uncertainty estimates, but are sensitive to the different ground truths. This investigation leverages different sources of ground truths to develop models that can accurately predict photo-$z$'s for a broader population of galaxies crucial for surveys such as Euclid and LSST."}

To process, analyse and identify such large amounts of GW signals arising from mergers of Binary Black Holes (BBH), we need both speed and accuracy. In the search for (massive) BBH signals, the biggest hurdle is posed by the various non-gaussian noise transients called glitches. Compared to our previous work, which used a simple convolutional neural network to distinguish BBHs from Blip glitches, this work uses transfer learning with InceptionNetV3 to distinguish BBHs from six types of most popular glitches from the third observing run of LIGO. While the glitches are real and identified via GravitySpy, the BBH signals are simulated and then injected into the real detector noise for each of the two LIGO detectors. We generate Sine-Gaussian Projection (SGP) maps by cross-correlating data with Sine-Gaussian functions of varied quality factors ($Q$) and central frequencies ($f_0$) and projected on the $Q$ - $f_0$ plane. We find that SGP maps make it easier to distinguish BBHs from glitches that look very similar to BBHs in the Time-Frequency maps like the Blips, while also maintaining significant morphological differences between BBHs and the more frequent glitches - Scattered Light and Fast Scattering. Our network has an accuracy of $87%$, a TPR of 0.83 for an FPR of 0.1 on our test dataset. It is also robust, retaining its level of accuracy, when tested on real BBH events identified in the first three observing runs of LIGO. Our proposed method shows the viability of using the SGP maps and neural networks for fast identification of GW events improving the efficiency of standard search pipelines."}

In a highly concentrated halo, the bar development is limited by the dominant multi-arm modes as a result of the swing amplification in the early stage. Only after the multi-arm modes decay, the bar growth proceeds mechanically owing to the particle trapping in continuation of that bar seed. In this scheme, the corotation resonance of the bar modes does not come into play at all, justified by a low amount of disk-halo angular momentum transfer and a modestly decreasing bar pattern speed. On the other hand, although reducing the halo concentration suggests the reduction of the preferred swing-amplified modes to be bi-symmetric, the bar formation in a lowly concentrated halo does not involve the swing amplification at all. Rather, the fast-growing linearly unstable bar modes of a single uniform frequency is solely the governing factor, attributed to a mild shearing. The bar modes trigger the corotation resonance since the beginning and such resonance is maintained until the end, which leads to a high amount of angular momentum transfer and a fast slowdown. For the intermediate halo concentration, the kinematical analyses of multiple non-axisymmetric modes suggests that the linear modes, the swing amplification, and the particle trapping are all present in the evolution chronology. To specify bars formed in the different halo concentrations, full analyses of the isophotal shape, the radial Fourier amplitude, and the resonance diagram can be of use."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "We investigate how the orbital evolution and mass distribution of infalling satellite galaxies shape the phase-space and radial distributions of intracluster light (ICL) relative to the underlying cluster dark matter (DM) halo. Using N-body simulations, we follow the tidal stripping and orbital evolution of satellite galaxies as they are accreted into a live cluster halo, systematically varying satellite-to-host mass ratio and orbital circularity. We measure the specific orbital energy and angular momentum of stripped stellar and DM material, finding that the stripped stars consistently occupy lower-energy and lower-angular momentum regions of phase-space than the stripped DM. The magnitude of this difference increases strongly towards more equal satellite--to--host mass ratios, while the dependence on orbital circularity is weak. We construct a predictive model for the phase-space properties of stripped stars and DM from a whole infalling satellite population and find that the resulting phase-space difference between the components are driven primarily by the characteristic mass of the infalling satellite stellar mass function. We find that the ICL is always more centrally concentrated than the DM. The magnitude of this offset depends on the characteristic mass and increases towards higher characteristic masses. Comparisons with four independent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations show that, once the infalling satellite stellar mass function is matched, the model reproduces the radial stellar-to-DM density profile offsets to better than the inter-simulation scatter. This demonstrates that the radial relationship between the ICL and the DM distribution is largely governed by satellite demographics. With adequate constraints on the infalling satellite population, ICL density profiles can therefore be used as informative tracers of the underlying radial DM distribution in clusters."}

Detailed chemical characterizations of these sources are needed to better define their chemistry during star formation. Our goal is to characterize the chemistry of the starless cores C2 and C16 in the B213/L1495 filament of the Taurus Molecular Cloud, and to understand how it relates to the environmental conditions and the evolutionary state of the cores. We made use of two complete spectral surveys at 7 mm of these sources, carried out using the Yebes 40-m telescope. Derived molecular abundances were compared with those of other sources in different evolutionary stages and with values computed by chemical models. Including isotopologs, 22 molecules were detected in B213-C2, and 25 in B213-C16. The derived rotational temperatures have values of between $\\sim$ 5 K and $\\sim$ 9 K. A comparison of the two sources shows lower abundances in C2, except for l-C$_{3}$H and HOCO$^{+}$, which have similar values in both cores. Model results indicate that both cores are best fit assuming early-time chemistry, and point to C2 being in a more advanced evolutionary stage, as it presents a higher molecular hydrogen density and sulfur depletion, and a lower cosmic-ray ionization rate. Our chemical modeling successfully accounts for the abundances of most molecules, including complex organic molecules and long cyanopolynes (HC$_{5}$N, HC$_{7}$N), but fails to reproduce those of the carbon chains CCS and C$_{3}$O. Chemical differences between C2 and C16 could stem from the evolutionary stage of the cores, with C2 being closer to the pre-stellar phase. Both cores are better fit assuming early-time chemistry of t $\\sim$ 0.1 Myr. The more intense UV radiation in the northern region of B213 could account for the high abundances of l-C$_{3}$H and HOCO$^{+}$ in C2."}

We first construct two neural network models: one trained using only spectral flux values and another trained using both fluxes and their associated errors. Both models achieve high classification accuracies of ~90-94 %. To gain physical interpretability of these networks, we fit all spectra with a simple phenomenological model consisting of a thermal disk component and a power-law. From this analysis, we identify the blackbody temperature, power-law index, the ratio of blackbody to power-law flux, the reduced $χ^2$, and the variance of the data as key parameters that likely contribute to the classification. We validate this inference by designing an additional neural network trained exclusively on this reduced parameter set, without using the spectral data directly. This parameter-based model achieves a classification accuracy comparable to that of the spectral models. Our results show that deep neural networks can not only classify compact objects in X-ray binaries with high accuracy but can also be interpreted in terms of physically meaningful spectral parameters derived from conventional X-ray spectral analysis. This framework offers a promising, mission-agnostic approach for compact object classification in current and future X-ray surveys."}

However, its high-luminosity end remains poorly calibrated due to insufficient reliable reverberation mapping (RM) data. We present a four-year RM campaign of the luminous quasar E1821+643 using the Lijiang 2.4-m telescope, supplemented by archival multi-wavelength data. E1821+643 is the most luminous AGN with an \\hb\\ RM measurement to date. The measured time lag of $83.2_{-18.7}^{+17.5}$ days is a factor of 5.6 shorter than predicted by the canonical $R_{\\rm BLR}$-$L_{5100}$ relation. By compiling the full \\hb\\ RM sample, we find that such deviation defines a lower envelope ($0.2R_{\\rm BLR}$) of measured lags across the entire luminosity range, while the upper envelope lies near $2R_{\\rm BLR}$, implying that the scatter for individual AGNs can reach 1 dex. Spectral decomposition reveals two distinct \\hb\\ components: a core component with a lag of $267.0_{-17.6}^{+16.6}$ days closer to the $R_{\\rm BLR}$-$L_{5100}$ relation, and a redshifted tail with a much shorter lag of $-49.0_{-34.5}^{+50.5}$ days. The short-lag component not only accounts for the significantly shortened overall lag, but also leads to an opposite interpretation of the intrinsic BLR kinematics. These effects can introduce systematic uncertainties in black hole mass estimates by factors of up to tens. Our findings demonstrate that shortened lags in high-accretion-rate AGNs arise from multi-component BLR structures, posing substantial challenges to single-epoch mass estimates and impacting SMBH demographics and cosmological applications."}

Traditional approaches to this problem commonly rely on decomposition-based techniques, including scale-based filtering methods such as Fourier or wavelet transforms, as well as adaptive methods like the Hilbert-Huang transformation. In realistic flows, however, coherent motions and turbulent fluctuations often overlap across a broad range of scales and interact nonlinearly, rendering any clear and unique separation inherently ambiguous, particularly in astrophysical settings where data are projected or sparsely sampled. In this work, we assess the robustness of AI-based turbulence-background separation using two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes simulations of decaying hydrodynamic turbulence. The simulations are initialized with a coherent background flow and divergence-free turbulent perturbations with a Kolmogorov-like power spectrum, and evolve without external forcing, providing a conservative physical testbed. A neural network trained exclusively on static synthetic images is applied to simulation snapshots at different evolutionary stages. We find that the model successfully recovers turbulent fluctuations during early and intermediate stages, when partial scale separation is preserved. At later stages, despite the substantial decay of turbulent energy and the resulting reduction in fluctuation strength, the model continues to recover visually and spectrally plausible turbulent structures and preserves inertial-range spectral scaling, demonstrating robust separation under increasingly challenging conditions. These results demonstrate the potential of applying AI models trained on static data to time-evolving turbulent flows, with direct implications for astrophysical and cosmological applications."}

Among present-day stellar systems, only globular clusters retain the ancient signatures needed to trace these primordial building blocks. Here we present the most detailed characterization to date of Tonantzintla 2, a prime candidate for a relic of the Milky Way's primordial bulge. It is a moderately metal-rich globular cluster projected onto the bulge that has remained largely unexplored despite its potential to constrain the early formation of the inner Milky Way. We derive its fundamental parameters using proper motion-corrected Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 and ACS photometry. By applying an isochrone fitting to very clean data, we obtain an age of 13.58 Gyr, a reddening E(B-V) = 1.44, a metallicity [M/H]=-0.68, and a heliocentric distance of d = 7.38 kpc. A complementary chemical-abundance analysis of seven member stars from APOGEE high-resolution spectroscopy reveals an enrichment pattern consistent with an in-situ origin. Tonantzintla 2 is among the oldest globular clusters studied in the literature, and the oldest so far analyzed in the Galactic bulge. Its age places a stringent constraint on the onset of the bulge formation, implying that star formation in the inner Galaxy began within ~0.2 Gyr of the Big Bang and that Tonantzintla 2 represents an exceptional relic of the Milky Way's earliest chemical enrichment."}

In particular, for the most massive haloes ($M_{\\rm vir}\\sim10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$), we find that DM self-interactions can shallow the central potential and thereby enhance gas cooling. We find that, in all models, the halo-to-halo variation in the HI profiles is explained by AGN feedback, and that the specific characteristics of DM model is largely subdominant. Nevertheless, we detect some systematic difference in the case of SIDM, with more HI surviving close to the centre with respect to other models. We provide fitting functions for the gas and HI profiles.\n  We investigate the galaxy-Ly$α$ cross-correlation function (\\galacc) for different halo masses, redshift and observation strategies.

We identify 20 methanol transitions, including A- and E-type lines in the v=0 state and E-type lines in the v$_{t}$=1 state, and detect 94 HMC candidates.

While effective for simple models and speedy spectral fitting, these local optimizers are prone to becoming trapped in local minima, particularly in high-dimensional or degenerate parameter spaces, and typically require extensive user intervention. In this work, we introduce XFit, a global optimization method for fitting X-ray data, which makes extensive use of the Ferret evolutionary algorithm. XFit enables automated exploration of complex parameter spaces, efficient mapping of confidence intervals, and identification of degenerate solutions that may be overlooked by local methods. We demonstrate the performance of XFit using two representative X-ray sources: the Central Compact Object in Cassiopeia A and the supernova remnant G41.1-0.3. These examples span both low- and high-dimensional models, allowing us to illustrate the advantages of global optimization. In both cases, XFit produces solutions that are consistent with or improve upon those found with traditional methods, while also revealing alternative fits or degenerate solutions within statistically acceptable confidence levels. The automated mapping of parameter space offered by XFit makes it a powerful complement to existing spectral fitting tools, particularly as models and data quality become increasingly complex. Future work will expand the application of XFit to broader datasets and more physically motivated models."}

This enables marginal likelihood calculation and model comparison with whatever sampling is most suitable for the task. However, the internal density estimators considered previously for the learned harmonic mean can struggle with highly multimodal posteriors. In this work we introduce flow matching-based continuous normalizing flows as a powerful architecture for the internal density estimation of the learned harmonic mean. We demonstrate the ability to handle challenging multimodal posteriors, including an example in 20 parameter dimensions, showcasing the method's ability to handle complex posteriors without the need for fine-tuning or heuristic modifications to the base distribution."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "We investigate how the orbital evolution and mass distribution of infalling satellite galaxies shape the phase-space and radial distributions of intracluster light (ICL) relative to the underlying cluster dark matter (DM) halo. Using N-body simulations, we follow the tidal stripping and orbital evolution of satellite galaxies as they are accreted into a live cluster halo, systematically varying satellite-to-host mass ratio and orbital circularity. We measure the specific orbital energy and angular momentum of stripped stellar and DM material, finding that the stripped stars consistently occupy lower-energy and lower-angular momentum regions of phase-space than the stripped DM. The magnitude of this difference increases strongly towards more equal satellite--to--host mass ratios, while the dependence on orbital circularity is weak. We construct a predictive model for the phase-space properties of stripped stars and DM from a whole infalling satellite population and find that the resulting phase-space difference between the components are driven primarily by the characteristic mass of the infalling satellite stellar mass function. We find that the ICL is always more centrally concentrated than the DM. The magnitude of this offset depends on the characteristic mass and increases towards higher characteristic masses. Comparisons with four independent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations show that, once the infalling satellite stellar mass function is matched, the model reproduces the radial stellar-to-DM density profile offsets to better than the inter-simulation scatter. This demonstrates that the radial relationship between the ICL and the DM distribution is largely governed by satellite demographics. With adequate constraints on the infalling satellite population, ICL density profiles can therefore be used as informative tracers of the underlying radial DM distribution in clusters."}

For this study, we analyse resolved H$α$ maps of 685 galaxies inside and outside the filaments around the Virgo cluster in addition to extensive measurements of integrated physical properties. We create a pipeline to decompose the H$α$ images into individual clumps. We find that the number and average size of clumps in a galaxy are well-defined functions of distance and angular resolution. In particular, the power-law relation between the number of clumps and the distance of a galaxy is consistent with a fractal structure of star forming regions. We formulate an algorithm to compare filament and non-filament galaxies after removing observational differences.

Studies of the properties of galaxies' resolved stars open a widow on their ancient galactic components, probing star formation during epochs more than 10 billion years ago. Extragalactic Planetary Nebulae (xPNe) can help decipher the signatures of mergers and interactions persisting over many dynamical times by tracing elemental abundances coupled with their kinematics and spatial distributions. With new facilities, reaching higher angular resolution, area coverage and sensitivity, one can use xPNe to map Oxygen and Argon element abundances, in addition to their kinematics, to extend the Galactic Archeology investigation to the oldest stellar aggregates in our Local Universe."}

This makes DEBS crucial targets for constraining the impact of various physical processes on stellar structure and evolution. Long-period binaries are particularly interesting because their separation minimises interactions between the components. This makes long-period binaries more comparable to single stars. However, the current sample of DEBS with high precision stellar parameters are dominated by short-period systems (e.g. ~90% of the Gaia DR3 eclipsing binaries have periods < 5 days). Facilities capable of performing detailed studies of long-period DEBS will be essential to further improve our understanding of stellar structure and evolution. Such facilities would need to be able to obtain spectroscopic observations of more distant objects at high resolution and cadence. 2-8m class telescopes with echelle spectrographs and an ability to monitor a large sample of stars would be required."}

The rest is dark matter, which does not emit or absorb light but plays a fundamental role in galaxy and structure evolution. Because it interacts only through gravity, one of the most direct probes is weak gravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by intervening mass. Here we present an extremely detailed, wide-area weak-lensing mass map, covering 0.77 deg x 0.70 deg, using high-resolution imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) as part of the COSMOS-Web survey. By measuring the shapes of 129 galaxies per square arcminute-many independently in the F115W and F150W bands-we achieve an angular resolution of 1.00 +/- 0.01 arcmin. Our map has more than twice the resolution of earlier Hubble Space Telescope maps, revealing how dark and luminous matter co-evolve across filaments, clusters, and under-densities. It traces mass features out to z ~ 2, including the most distant structure at z ~ 1.1. The sensitivity to high-redshift lensing constrains galaxy environments at the peak of cosmic star formation and sets a high-resolution benchmark for testing theories about the nature of dark matter and the formation of large-scale cosmic structure"}

We emphasize the extensive work in this area by our late colleague Roberto Gallino and continue in an overview, concentrating on attempts to reproduce the solar r-process pattern with historical site-independent approaches, based on nuclear physics far from stability. In a second step we address the existing proposals for astrophysical sites. Among stellar observations we start with available observations of individual events before analyzing low-metallicity stars, which witness r-process contributions in the early Galaxy.We conclude with a comparison of observations and model predictions, focusing on our present ability to identify the responsible individual astrophysical sites by their imprint in Galactic evolution."}

These theories lead to the formation of dense dark matter structures known as minihalos, which provide insights into early Universe dynamics and have implications for direct detection experiments. We examine the mass loss of minihalos during stellar encounters, building on previous studies that derived formulas for mass loss and performed N-body simulations. We propose a new formula for the mass loss that accounts for changes in the minihalo profile after disruption by a passing star. We also investigate the mass loss for multiple stellar encounters. We demonstrate that accurately assessing the mass loss in minihalos due to multiple stellar encounters necessitates considering the alterations in the minihalo's binding energy after each encounter, as overlooking this aspect results in a substantial underestimation of the mass loss.\n  We further extend our analysis to the Galactic environment by more accurately incorporating multiple stellar encounters and dynamical relaxation timescales, simulating minihalo orbits in the Galactic potential. Our results show stellar interactions are more destructive than previously estimated, reducing minihalo mass retention at the solar system to ~30%, compared to earlier estimates of ~60%. This enhanced loss arises from cumulative energy injections when relaxation periods between stellar encounters are accounted for. The altered minihalo mass function implies a larger fraction of axion dark matter occupies inter-minihalo space, potentially increasing the local axion density and improving haloscope detection prospects. This thesis highlights the significance of detailed modeling of stellar disruptions in shaping the axion dark matter distribution."}

We identify emission lines from molecular and ionized species and analyze their spatial morphology using line integrated intensity maps. We derive gas temperature and column density through excitation diagram analysis of H2 rotational lines and compared results with shock models. The observations reveal extended molecular hydrogen emission tracing the bipolar outflow, with the H2 gas temperatures distributed into warm (~550 K) and hot (~2500 K) components, likely originating from moderate velocity J-type shocks and some UV irradiation. We detect forbidden atomic and ionized emission lines of [Ni ii], [Ar ii], [Ne ii], [Ne iii], [S i], and [Fe ii] showing spatially extended morphology. Double peaked emission profiles were seen in [Ar ii], [Ne iii], and [Fe ii], in the eastern region, suggesting that the high velocity component traces a fast, highly ionized jet. Radial velocity map derived from [Ne ii] emission shows the eastern region to be redshifted and the western region blueshifted, contrary to earlier interpretations. The analysis of the MIRI/MRS observations reveals the presence of molecular, atomic, and ionized emission lines in this low-mass protostar connected with active outflow signatures. The most striking feature discovered is the presence of a poorly collimated high velocity ionized jet, embedded within a broader wide-angle molecular outflow likely driven by a disk wind. The co-existence of these components supports a stratified outflow structure and suggest L1527 exhibits unique jet-launching characteristics atypical for its early evolutionary stage."}

Using follow-up high-resolution VLBI observations and archival data, we investigate the morphology and the variations in orientation and core flux density of the 3C 66A jet to gain a deeper insights into its kinematic behavior and physical origins. We performed KVN and VERA array (KaVA) observations at 22/43 GHz over three epochs in 2014 and collected 109 sets of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) archival data at 43 GHz between 1996 - 2025. We imaged the parsec-scale jet and parameterized it using circular Gaussian fittings to the UV visibilities. Finally, we derived the inner jet PA and the core flux densities for the VLBA data. The jet presents a twisted morphology in the KaVA maps. The PA of the fitted Gaussian components is in the range between 170 deg and 195 deg. Our kinematic analysis using the VLBA data indicates that the PA oscillates with an amplitude of 7.77 pm 0.79 deg and a period of 10.94 pm 0.22 years, presented for the first time in this work. This oscillation is topped by a continuous clockwise shift of the PA by -0.83 pm 0.07 deg/year. We also identified a strong core flux variability with possible periodicity and a 2 sigma correlation between the core flux density and the inner jet PA change. We discuss possible physical models that could explain the observed features for this object; in particular, a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) system, Lense Thirring (LT) effect, and jet or disk instabilities. The oscillation and continuous shift of the PA and the possible radio flux periodicity, together with the optical flux periodicity of approximately 2 years that had previously been confirmed in several independent studies, favor a jet precession scenario driven by orbital motion and disk-orbit misalignment in a SMBHB system."}

Using simulations, we demonstrate accurate and precise recovery of image positions, fluxes, and time delays, together with inference of complex lens mass distributions -- including the mass density slope, $γ$ -- from images of lensed point sources alone. We further show that we can achieve statistical uncertainty of $\\sim 3.6\\%$ ($\\sim 2.5\\, \\mathrm{km\\, s^{-1}/Mpc}$) on $H_0$ from a single system, with full forward modeling, i.e., simultaneous inference of all lens model parameters together with $H_0$. We apply our pipeline to two well-studied lensed SNe Ia, Zwicky and iPTF16geu. For SN iPTF16geu, unlike previous modeling efforts, we model only the images of the lensed point source (the SN) and do not use the lensed images of the extended host-galaxy. Nevertheless, we are able to infer all of the mass parameters modeled in earlier studies, and our best-fit values, including $γ$, are fully consistent with published results. In the case of SN Zwicky, taking the same approach, however, we obtain an alternative best-fit model compared to published results, underscoring the importance of fully exploring the model parameter space."}
