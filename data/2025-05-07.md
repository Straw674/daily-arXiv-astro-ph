### [1] [Magnetic field amplification during a turbulent collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02885)
*Axel Brandenburg,Evangelia Ntormousi*

**TL;DR**: 通过三维模拟研究引力坍缩过程中湍流衰减对磁场放大的影响，发现大磁雷诺数下共形磁场可指数增长，且螺旋湍流比非螺旋湍流更有效驱动发电机作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 引力坍缩是否触发发电机作用是一个重要问题，尤其在早期宇宙中。研究通过超共形坐标分析引力坍缩中湍流衰减对磁场放大的影响。

Data: 使用三维模拟数据。

Method: 采用超共形坐标和三维模拟方法研究磁场放大过程。

Result: 大磁雷诺数下共形磁场可指数增长；螺旋湍流比非螺旋湍流更有效驱动发电机作用；非磁模拟中涡度与粘度和马赫数相关，而磁场存在时涡度源于洛伦兹力的旋度。

Abstract: The question of whether a dynamo can be triggered by gravitational collapse
is of great interest, especially for the early Universe. Here, we employ
supercomoving coordinates to study the magnetic field amplification from
decaying turbulence during gravitational collapse. We perform three-dimensional
simulations and show that for large magnetic Reynolds numbers, there can be
exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time before
the decay of turbulence impedes further amplification. The collapse dynamics
only affects the nonlinear feedback from the Lorentz force, which diminishes
more rapidly for shorter collapse times, allowing nearly kinematic continued
growth. We also confirm that helical turbulence is more efficient in driving
dynamo action than nonhelical turbulence, but this difference decreases for
larger collapse times. We also show that for nearly irrotational flows, dynamo
amplification is still possible, but it is always associated with a growth of
vorticity -- even if it still remains very small. In nonmagnetic runs, the
growth of vorticity is associated with viscosity and grows with the Mach
number. In the presence of magnetic fields, vorticity emerges from the curl of
the Lorentz force.

**TL;DR**: 通过分析NGC 4449矮星暴星系中年轻恒星的空间分布，研究发现恒星结构的层次性分布随时间减弱，主要由内部恒星运动驱动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究背景包括NGC 4449矮星暴星系中年轻恒星结构的分布和演化，以及现有研究中关于恒星结构层次性演化的不足。

Data: 使用了GULP巡天数据，分析了年龄小于100 Myr的场星的空间分布。

Method: 采用HDBSCAN密度聚类算法识别恒星复合体和子结构，并通过年龄依赖的两点相关函数（TPCF）分析恒星分布的层次性。

Result: 研究发现中央棒状区域的恒星结构在前60 Myr内明显扩张，而东北臂状结构无明显趋势；年轻恒星表现出强烈的层次性分布，但随时间减弱，TPCF的幂律斜率从0.65（年龄<5 Myr）降至0.4（年龄>50 Myr）。

Abstract: We investigate the hierarchical distribution and evolution of young stellar
structures in the dwarf starburst galaxy NGC 4449 using data from the GULP
survey. By analyzing the spatial distribution of field stars younger than 100
Myr, we identify large-scale stellar complexes and substructures using HDBSCAN
-- a density-based clustering algorithm -- and trace their evolution over time.
While comparing these stellar structures in different regions of the galaxy, we
find that the central bar-like region shows a clear expansion of the structures
within the first $\sim$ 60 Myrs, while the arm-like structure in the NE shows
no discernible trend, possibly due to external perturbations from tidal
interactions with a neighboring galaxy. An age-dependent two point correlation
function (TPCF) analysis shows that young stars exhibit a strong hierarchical
distribution, with clustering strength decreasing over time. The power-law
slope of the TPCF, which starts at $\alpha \sim 0.65$ for stars younger than 5
Myr, shows a slight decline to $\alpha \sim 0.4$ for stars older than 50 Myr,
though it does not reach a completely flat (random) distribution. This trend
indicates a subtle weakening of structural hierarchy among young ($<$100 Myr)
stars, which is primarily driven by internal stellar motions. Future work will
extend this analysis to the remaining 26 galaxies in the GULP survey to better
constrain the role of the galactic environment in shaping the hierarchical
evolution of young stellar populations.

### [3] [Abundant Population of Broad H$α$ Emitters in the GOODS-N Field Revealed by CONGRESS, FRESCO, and JADES](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02895)
*Junyu Zhang,Eiichi Egami,Fengwu Sun,Xiaojing Lin,Jianwei Lyu,Yongda Zhu,Pierluigi Rinaldi,Yang Sun,Andrew J. Bunker,Rachana Bhatawdekar,Jakob M. Helton,Roberto Maiolino,Zheng Ma,Brant Robertson,Sandro Tacchella,Giacomo Venturi,Christina C. Williams,Chris Willott*

**TL;DR**: The study identifies 19 broad Hα emitters at z~4-5.5 using JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy, revealing insights into their black hole masses, AGN luminosities, and host stellar masses, while challenging the color selection criteria for Little Red Dots (LRDs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The research explores the properties of broad Hα emitters at high redshifts (z~3.7-6.5) in the GOODS-N field, addressing gaps in understanding the accretion rates of black holes and the validity of color selection criteria for LRDs.

Data: The study utilizes JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy data from FRESCO and CONGRESS, complemented by JADES imaging.

Method: The analysis involves spectroscopic identification of broad Hα emitters, derivation of black hole masses and AGN luminosities from the broad Hα components, and host stellar mass estimation via SED fitting.

Result: The findings include the identification of 19 broad Hα emitters, with most accreting at ~10% of the Eddington limit, higher M_BH/M_* ratios compared to local relations, and challenges to the LRD color selection criteria, suggesting line-boosting effects may explain some LRD characteristics.

Abstract: We present a spectroscopic search for broad H$\alpha$ emitters at z~3.7-6.5
in the GOODS-N field, utilizing JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO
and CONGRESS, complemented by JADES imaging. We identify 19 broad H$\alpha$
emitters with FWHM > 1000 km/s at z~4-5.5, including 9 new sources. The black
hole masses and AGN bolometric luminosities, inferred from the broad H$\alpha$
components, indicate that most sources are accreting at ~10% of the Eddington
limit. We derive their host stellar masses via SED fitting and find higher
$M_{BH}/M_{*}$ ratios relative to the local $M_{BH}$-$M_{*}$ relations,
consistent with previous studies. We find that 42% of the sample do not satisfy
the widely-used color selection criteria for Little Red Dots (LRDs), with the
majority of these sources lacking the characteristic steep red slope. A
comparison of the average SEDs between our sample and LRDs selected in the same
field reveals that the steep red slopes observed in some LRDs are likely due to
line-boosting effects as previously suggested. Furthermore, we find that 68% of
color-selected LRDs with H$\alpha$ detections in the NIRCam/Grism spectra do
not exhibit broad-line features. While the limited sensitivity of the grism
spectra may hinder the detection of broad-line components in faint sources, our
findings still highlight the enigmatic nature of the LRD population.

**TL;DR**: 研究高红移低光度活动星系核（AGNs）的大尺度环境和聚类特性，发现它们与普通恒星形成星系类似，可能代表星系演化中的一个常见阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究关注高红移低光度AGNs的大尺度环境和聚类特性，以理解其与普通恒星形成星系的关系及其在星系演化中的作用。

Data: 使用JWST NIRCam成像和WFSS数据（来自CONGRESS和FRESCO巡天）中的28个低光度AGNs和782个Hα发射体（HAEs）。

Method: 通过比较AGNs和HAEs的密度场和两点交叉相关函数，分析其聚类特性和宿主暗物质晕质量。

Result: 低光度AGNs不偏好高密度环境，与HAEs具有相似的聚类特性和宿主暗物质晕质量，表明它们可能是星系演化中的一个常见阶段。

Abstract: We study the large-scale environments and clustering properties of 28
low-luminosity AGNs at $z=3.9-6$ in the GOODS-N field. Our sample, identified
from the JWST NIRCam Imaging and WFSS data in CONGRESS and FRESCO surveys with
either broad H$\alpha$ emission lines or V-shape continua, are compared to 782
H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) selected from the same data. These AGNs are located
in diverse large-scale environments and do not preferentially reside in denser
environments compared to HAEs. Their overdensity field, $\delta$, averaged over
(15 $h^{-1}$cMpc)$^3$, ranges from $-0.56$ to 10.56, and shows no clear
correlation with broad-line luminosity, black hole (BH) masses, or the AGN
fraction. It suggests that $> 10$ cMpc structures do not significantly
influence BH growth. We measure the two-point cross-correlation function of
AGNs with HAEs, finding a comparable amplitude to that of the HAE
auto-correlation. This indicates similar bias parameters and host dark matter
halo masses for AGNs and HAEs. The correlation length of field AGNs is 4.26
$h^{-1}$cMpc, and 7.66 $h^{-1}$cMpc at $3.9 < z < 5$ and $5 < z < 6$,
respectively. We infer a median host dark matter halo mass of $\log
(M_h/M_\odot)\approx 11.0-11.2$ and host stellar masses of $\log
(M_\star/M_\odot) \approx 8.4-8.6$ by comparing with the UniverseMachine
simulation. Our clustering analysis suggests that low-luminosity AGNs at high
redshift reside in normal star-forming galaxies with overmassive BHs. They
represent an intrinsically distinct population from luminous quasars and could
be a common phase in galaxy evolution.

### [5] [The role of magnetic field and stellar feedback in the evolution of filamentary structures in collapsing star-forming clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02903)
*Paolo Suin,Doris Arzoumanian,Annie Zavagno,Patrick Hennebelle*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过数值模拟分析了磁场和恒星反馈对分子云中丝状结构演化的影响，揭示了磁场强度和反馈机制在星形成过程中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 分子云中的丝状结构在恒星形成过程中扮演重要角色，但其演化受磁场和恒星反馈的影响尚不完全清楚。

Data: 使用两个不同质量-通量比（μ=2和μ=8）的数值模拟数据，模拟了一个质量10^4太阳质量的云坍塌过程。

Method: 通过DisPerSE工具提取三维丝状网络，并分析其在恒星形成事件中的演化特性。

Result: 强磁场下云维持稀疏的丝状网络，丝状结构主要垂直于磁场线；弱磁场下形成单一中心枢纽，丝状结构趋向平行于磁场线。电离反馈最终主导丝状结构的排列。

Abstract: Context: Filaments are common features in molecular clouds and they play a
key role in star formation (SF). Studying their life cycle is essential to
fully understand the SF process.
  Aims: We aim to characterise the impact of magnetic field ($B$) and stellar
feedback on the evolution of filamentary structures in star-forming clouds.
  Methods: We performed two numerical simulations of a collapsing
$10^4\,$M$_\odot$ cloud with different mass-to-flux ratios ($\mu=2$ and
$\mu=8$), including early stellar feedback (jets and HII regions). Using
DisPerSE, we extracted the three-dimensional filamentary network and analysed
its properties as it evolves throughout the SF event.
  Results: We observed that the filamentary network in the simulations follow
two distinct evolutionary pathways. In the strongly magnetised case, the cloud
maintains a sparser filamentary network, and the arising filaments are
predominantly perpendicular to $B$ lines. With a weak field, the cloud develops
a single central hub, with converging filaments favouring a parallel alignment
relative to $B$. Furthermore, while always accreting, filaments exhibit faster
flows towards the hub relative to the surrounding gas. In the weakly magnetised
run, the central hub dominates the dynamics, and filaments exhibit faster flows
as they approach the central hub. Finally, once the expanding HII region
impacts the filaments, they align to $B$ independently of the initial
configuration.
  Conclusions: Magnetic fields play a critical role in shaping the structure
and dynamics of molecular clouds. Stronger magnetic fields slow the cloud's
evolution and inhibit the formation of central hubs, promoting a broader
filamentary network instead.
  However, ionising feedback dominates the late-stage evolution, overriding the
initial differences and dictating the final filament configuration.

### [6] [Recovering the pattern speeds of edge-on barred galaxies via an orbit-superposition method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02917)
*Yunpeng Jin,Ling Zhu,Behzad Tahmasebzadeh,Shude Mao,Glenn van de Ven,Rui Guo,Runsheng Cai*

**TL;DR**: 研究者开发了一种用于侧视棒旋星系的轨道叠加方法，并评估了其恢复棒旋转模式速度的能力，结果表明该方法在大多数情况下能准确恢复真实模式速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 棒旋星系的棒旋转模式速度（Ωp）是天体物理学中的重要参数，但目前缺乏针对侧视棒旋星系的有效测量方法。

Data: 研究使用了来自Auriga模拟的三个模拟星系（Au-18、Au-23和Au-28）的数据，并生成了类似MUSE的侧视（倾角θT≥85°）和不同棒方位角（φT）的模拟数据集。

Method: 研究者开发了一种轨道叠加方法，用于侧视棒旋星系，并通过模拟数据评估了该方法恢复棒旋转模式速度的能力。

Result: 对于侧视棒（φT≥50°）的模拟数据，模型恢复的模式速度Ωp在68%置信水平下覆盖了真实模式速度ΩT（10/12案例），平均不确定性为10%。对于端视棒（φT≤30°），模型不确定性显著依赖于棒方位角，但通过更严格的形态约束可将平均不确定性降至14%。所有模型的95%置信水平均覆盖了真实值。

Abstract: We develop an orbit-superposition method for edge-on barred galaxies, and
evaluate its capability to recover the bar pattern speed $\rm\Omega_p$. We
select three simulated galaxies Au-18, Au-23, and Au-28 with known pattern
speeds from the Auriga simulations, and create MUSE-like mock data sets with
edge-on views (inclination angles $\theta_{\rm T}\ge85^\circ$) and various bar
azimuthal angles $\varphi_{\rm T}$. For mock data sets with side-on bars
($\varphi_{\rm T}\ge50^\circ$), the model-recovered pattern speeds
$\rm\Omega_p$ encompass the true pattern speeds $\rm\Omega_T$ within the model
uncertainties ($1\sigma$ confidence levels, $68\%$) for 10 of 12 cases. The
average model uncertainty within the $1\sigma$ confidence levels is equal to
$10\%$. For mock data sets with end-on bars ($\varphi_{\rm T}\le30^\circ$), the
model uncertainties of $\rm\Omega_p$ depend significantly on the bar azimuthal
angles $\varphi_{\rm T}$, with the uncertainties of cases with $\varphi_{\rm
T}=10^\circ$ approaching $\sim30\%$. However, by imposing a stricter constraint
on the bar morphology ($p_{\rm bar}\le0.50$), the average uncertainties are
reduced to $14\%$, and $\rm\Omega_p$ still encompass $\rm\Omega_T$ within the
model uncertainties for three of four cases. For all the models that we create
in this paper, the $2\sigma$ ($95\%$) confidence levels of the model-recovered
pattern speeds $\rm\Omega_p$ always cover the true values $\rm\Omega_T$.

**TL;DR**: 通过残差分析和机器学习测试，研究发现恒星速度弥散和可能的暗物质晕质量与超大质量黑洞质量相关性最强，支持活动星系核的动能反馈是塑造黑洞比例关系的主要驱动力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 超大质量黑洞（SMBHs）与其宿主星系之间的相关性仍存在观测和理论上的挑战，现有研究未能完全理解其关系。

Data: 使用本地非活动星系的最新样本，包括其光度特性的统一校准和中心SMBHs的动态测量质量。

Method: 采用成对残差分析和机器学习测试，并对比两种包含活动星系核动能反馈的流体动力学模拟。

Result: 恒星速度弥散和可能的暗物质晕质量与SMBH质量相关性最强，活动星系核的动能反馈可能是主要驱动力；当前模拟未能完全捕捉观测趋势，且数据可能存在偏差或不完整。

Abstract: The correlations between Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) and their host
galaxies still defy our understanding from both the observational and
theoretical perspectives. Here we perform pairwise residual analysis on the
latest sample of local inactive galaxies with a uniform calibration of their
photometric properties and with dynamically measured masses of their central
SMBHs. The residuals reveal that stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$ and,
possibly host dark matter halo mass $M_{\rm halo}$, appear as the galactic
properties most correlated with SMBH mass, with a secondary (weaker)
correlation with spheroidal (bulge) mass $M_{\rm sph}$, as also corroborated by
additional Machine Learning tests. These findings may favour energetic/kinetic
feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) as the main driver in shaping SMBH
scaling relations. Two state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations, inclusive of
kinetic AGN feedback, are able to broadly capture the mean trends observed in
the residuals, although they tend to either favour $M_{\rm sph}$ as the most
fundamental property, or generate too flat residuals. Increasing AGN feedback
kinetic output does not improve the comparison with the data. In the Appendix
we also show that the galaxies with dynamically measured SMBHs are biased high
in $\sigma$ at fixed luminosity with respect to the full sample of local
galaxies, proving that this bias is not a byproduct of stellar mass
discrepancies. Overall, our results suggest that probing the SMBH-galaxy
scaling relations in terms of total stellar mass alone may induce biases, and
that either current data sets are incomplete, and/or that more insightful
modelling is required to fully reproduce observations.

**TL;DR**: 通过数值模拟研究球状星团中多族群的动力学混合过程，并引入新的观测参数来量化其空间和运动学差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 球状星团（GCs）中存在多个族群，这些族群在轻元素丰度上表现出差异，并且在空间分布和运动学上也存在差异，这些差异的强度随星团的动力学年龄而变化。

Data: 研究使用了数值模拟生成的数据。

Method: 通过数值模拟跟踪多族群在能量和角动量相空间中的动力学混合过程，并量化其混合程度。

Result: 研究提出了新的观测参数（ΔAβ和σLz）来量化族群间的运动学差异，并指出当前观测到的差异可能无法直接反映形成时的原始差异。

Abstract: Context: Globular clusters (GCs) host multiple populations characterised by
abundance variations in a number of light elements. In many cases, these
populations also show spatial and/or kinematic differences, which vary in
strength from cluster to cluster and tend to decrease with the clusters'
dynamical ages. Aims: In this work, we aim to study the dynamical mixing of
multiple populations and establish a link between the more theoretical aspects
of the mixing process and various observational parameters that quantify
differences between the populations' spatial concentration and velocity
anisotropy. Methods: We follow the dynamical mixing of multiple populations in
a set of numerical simulations through their distribution in the energy and
angular momentum phase space and quantify the evolution of their degree of
dynamical mixing. Results: We present the degree of dynamical mixing traced by
the intrinsic differences in the phase space distribution of the populations.
We compare the differences in phase-space with three observable quantities that
describe the degree of mixing in the structural and kinematic differences of
the populations: $A^{+}$, commonly used in the literature for spatial
differences; and we introduce two new parameters, $\Delta A_{\beta}$ that
traces the difference in velocity anisotropy and $\sigma_{\text{Lz}}$, that
traces the angular momentum distribution of stars. Conclusions: Our study
provides new insights into the dynamics of phase space mixing of multiple
populations in globular clusters. We show that differences between the 1P and
the 2P observed in old clusters contain key information on the cluster's
dynamics and the 1P and the 2P spatial and kinematic properties set by the
formation processes, but caution is necessary in using the strength of the
present-day differences to quantitatively constrain those imprinted at the time
of formation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 尘埃在星际介质中虽然质量占比很小，但在许多物理和化学过程中起主要作用，包括紫外/光学波段的辐射消光和热红外发射。尘埃颗粒的结构复杂，具有颗粒性、不对称性和分层性，这些特性显著影响其与辐射场的相互作用。

Method: 采用过渡矩阵形式的新实现方法，设计用于在可扩展并行硬件设施上运行。

Result: 提出了一种新方法，能够研究非球对称条件下辐射与尘埃颗粒的相互作用，为准确解释观测结果提供了计算工具。

Abstract: In spite of accounting for only a small fraction of the mass of the
Interstellar Medium (ISM), dust plays a primary role in many physical and
chemical processes in the Universe. It is the main driver of extinction of
radiation in the UV/optical wavelength range and a primary source of thermal IR
emission. Dust grains contain most of the refractory elements of the ISM and
they host chemical processes that involve complex molecular compounds. However,
observational evidence suggests that grain structure is highly non-trivial and
that dust particles are characterized by granularity, asymmetry and
stratification, which significantly affect their interaction with radiation
fields. Accurate modeling of such interaction is fundamental to properly
explain observational results, but it is a computationally demanding task. Here
we present the possibility to investigate the effects of radiation/particle
interactions in non-spherically symmetric conditions using a novel
implementation of the Transition Matrix formalism, designed to run on scalable
parallel hardware facilities.

**TL;DR**: 通过比较Dartmouth恒星演化程序的理论等龄线与HST观测数据，研究分析了八个银河系球状星团的绝对年龄，发现年龄与金属丰度之间存在明显趋势，并提供了银河系球状星团的绝对年龄-金属丰度关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 球状星团（GCs）提供了统计上显著的恒星群体，覆盖了不同的演化阶段，能够对恒星演化模型参数和年龄提供稳健的约束。

Data: 使用了HST ACS观测数据，分析了八个银河系球状星团，其金属丰度介于[Fe/H] = -2.31到-0.77之间。

Method: 通过比较Dartmouth恒星演化程序的理论等龄线与HST观测数据，构建了合成颜色-星等图（CMD），并应用两种全CMD拟合方法，结合距离和红化范围，测量了每个球状星团的绝对年龄。

Result: 研究结果显示，最佳拟合的绝对年龄范围约为11.5到13.5 Gyr，典型误差为0.5-0.75 Gyr；数据表明在较低金属丰度下年龄明显更老。距离和红化在年龄确定中占不确定性的50%以上，金属丰度、α丰度、混合长度和氦扩散是误差预算中最重要的恒星物理参数。研究还提供了银河系球状星团的绝对年龄-金属丰度关系。

Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) provide statistically significant coeval populations
of stars spanning various evolutionary stages, allowing robust constraints on
stellar evolution model parameters and ages. We analyze eight old Milky Way GCs
with metallicities between [Fe/H] $=-2.31$ and $-0.77$ by comparing theoretical
isochrone sets from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program to HST
observations. The theoretical isochrones include uncertainties introduced by
$21$ stellar evolution parameters such as convective mixing, opacity,
diffusion, and nuclear reactions, capturing much of the quantifiable physics
used in our code. For each isochrone, we construct synthetic color-magnitude
diagrams (CMD) near the main-sequence turn-off region and apply two
full-CMD-fitting methods to fit HST ACS data across a range of distance and
reddening and measure the absolute age of each GC from the resulting posterior
distribution, which accounts for uncertainties in the stellar models,
observations, and fitting method. The resulting best-fitting absolute ages
range from $\approx 11.5$ to $13.5$ Gyr, with a typical error of $0.5-0.75$
Gyr; the data show a clear trend toward older ages at lower metallicities.
Notably, distance and reddening account for over $50\%$ of the uncertainty in
age determination in each case, with metallicity, $\alpha$ abundance, mixing
length, and helium diffusion being the most important stellar physics
parameters for the error budget. We also provide an absolute age-metallicity
relation for Milky Way GCs.

**TL;DR**: 研究利用JWST/NIRSpec和NIRCam观测了17颗光谱确认的大质量静止星系，分析了其形态学特性，揭示了星系尺寸与质量的关系以及环境密度对星系结构的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究关注高红移（3.0 < z < 4.3）大质量静止星系的形态学特性，这些星系的质量范围在10.2 < log(M*/M⊙) < 11.2之间。研究旨在探索星系尺寸与质量的关系以及环境因素对星系结构的影响。

Data: 研究使用了JWST/NIRSpec和NIRCam观测的F277W和F444W波段成像数据。

Method: 通过Sérsic轮廓拟合分析星系的形态学特性，并使用随机森林回归器识别环境密度对星系结构的影响。同时，研究还结合了IllustrisTNG模拟数据进行分析。

Result: 研究发现星系尺寸与质量关系显示从z∼4至今星系尺寸增长了约7倍，其中约2倍增长发生在z∼2之前。环境密度是预测星系凸起-总质量比（B/T）的最强因素，而模拟数据表明合并事件（通过外源恒星质量分数表征）是B/T的主要预测因素。研究还揭示了高B/T星系在不同环境中的不同形成机制，包括合并引发的星暴和盘不稳定性等。

Abstract: We present the morphological properties of 17 spectroscopically confirmed
massive quiescent galaxies ($10.2 < \log(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) < 11.2$) at $3.0 <
z < 4.3$, observed with JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam. Using S\'{e}rsic profile fits
to the F277W and F444W imaging, we derive the size-mass relation and find
typical sizes of $\sim$0.6-0.8 kpc at $M_{\ast} = 5 \times 10^{10}~M_{\odot}$,
consistent with a factor of $\sim$7 growth from $z \sim 4$ to the present day,
including a factor of $\sim$2 by $z \sim 2$. Galaxies with earlier formation
times ($z_{50} \gtrsim 5$) tend to be larger (up to 0.3 dex above the
relation), while late-forming galaxies are more compact. Using a random forest
regressor, we identify local environmental density, quantified by
$\log(1+\delta^{\prime}_{3})$ from the distances to the three nearest
neighbors, as the strongest predictor of bulge-to-total ratio ($B/T$), which
ranges from 0.25 to 1. Applying the same method to the IllustrisTNG simulation,
the ex-situ stellar mass fraction ($f_{\ast,\mathrm{ex\text{-}situ}}$) -- a
proxy for mergers -- is the dominant predictor of $B/T$. Galaxies with high
$B/T$ in dense environments show bursty star formation and short quenching
timescales ($\lesssim0.4$ Gyr), consistent with bulge growth via merger-induced
starbursts; in simulations, such galaxies exhibit elevated ex-situ fractions
($\sim20\%$-$30\%$). In contrast, some high-$B/T$ galaxies in
intermediate-density environments have low ex-situ fractions, suggesting that
additional mechanisms -- such as violent disk instabilities -- may contribute.
These findings point to multiple bulge growth pathways at high redshift,
unified by rapid gas accretion, central starbursts, and AGN feedback, as
predicted by cosmological simulations.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域需要更多关于类星体对的统计样本，以支持双活动星系核、引力透镜和类星体聚类的研究。

Data: 使用了DESI DR1类星体样本，包含约160万个光谱确认的类星体。

Method: 采用红移依赖的自匹配程序，并应用物理约束（投影分离不超过110 kpc，视线速度差不超过2000 km/s）来识别类星体对。

Result: 识别出1,842个候选类星体对，其中64.3%的类星体对的视线速度差低于600 km/s，表明许多系统可能存在物理关联。

Abstract: We present a catalog of quasar pairs (QPs) constructed from the DESI DR1
quasar sample, which includes approximately 1.6 million spectroscopically
confirmed quasars. Using a redshift-dependent self-matching procedure and
applying physical constraints on projected separation (up to 110 kpc) and
line-of-sight velocity difference (up to 2000 km/s), we identified 1,842
candidate quasar pairs. Each pair is spectroscopically confirmed, providing
reliable redshift and velocity information. We visually classified these
systems using DESI Legacy Imaging and SPARCL spectral data into four
categories: QP (quasar pairs), QPC (quasar pair candidates), LQC (lensed quasar
candidates), and Uncertain. The redshift distribution peaks at around z = 1 to
2.5, and 64.3 percent of QPs have line-of-sight velocity differences below 600
km/s, suggesting that many systems may be physically associated. This catalog
provides a statistically meaningful sample for future studies of dual AGNs,
gravitational lensing, and quasar clustering.

**TL;DR**: FAST望远镜对NGC2683的HI观测揭示了比VLA更广泛的HI分布，发现了三个邻近矮星系和高速云，并提出了HI晕可能源于外部气体吸积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前对NGC2683的HI分布研究主要基于VLA的观测，但FAST的高灵敏度揭示了更广泛的HI分布和新的矮星系及高速云，为理解星系演化提供了新视角。

Data: 使用FAST望远镜对NGC2683进行的HI观测数据，包括HI通量、质量及邻近矮星系和高速云的探测。

Method: 采用FAST望远镜进行HI观测，并与VLA的观测结果对比，结合Vollmer et al. 2016的模型分析HI晕。

Result: FAST观测到NGC2683的HI分布比VLA更广，总HI通量为112.1 Jy km s^-1（质量2.32×10^9 M⊙），发现三个矮星系和三个高速云，HI晕质量3×10^8 M⊙，可能源于外部气体吸积。

Abstract: We present the results of our recent HI observations conducted on the edge-on
galaxy NGC2683 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope
(FAST). In comparison to previous observations made by the VLA, FAST has
detected a more extensive distribution of HI. Particularly noteworthy is that
the detections made by FAST extend approximately four times farther than those
of the VLA in the vertical direction from the galactic plane. The total HI flux
measured for NGC2683 amounts to $F_{\rm HI} = 112.1\,\rm{Jy\,km\,s^{-1}}$
(equivalent to a total HI mass of $M_{\rm HI} = 2.32 \times 10^9\,{\rm
M_\odot}$), which is slightly higher than that detected by VLA. FAST has also
identified three dwarf galaxies in close proximity to NGC2683, namely KK69,
NGC2683dw1 (hereafter dw1), and NGC2683dw3$?$ (hereafter dw3$?$). dw3$?$ is
situated within the extended HI distribution of NGC2683 in projection and lies
near the tail of KK69 extending towards NGC2683. These observations suggest
that dw3$?$ is likely a result of the accretion process from NGC2683 to KK69.
Furthermore, FAST has detected three high-velocity clouds (HVCs), with complex
B potentially undergoing accretion with NGC2683. Based on the model from
Vollmer et al. 2016 and incorporating the HI halo component, we found that the
model with the added HI halo aligns more closely with our FAST observations in
NGC2683. The estimated mass of this HI halo is $3 \times 10^8\,{\rm M_\odot}$,
constituting approximately 13% of the total HI mass of the galaxy. We suggest
that the origination of this HI halo is more likely attributed to external gas
accretion.

**TL;DR**: 研究通过JWST UNCOVER和MegaScience巡天数据，分析了四个小红色点源（LRDs）附近的扩展发射光谱，确认其中三个扩展发射与LRDs物理相关，并揭示了其可能的起源为恒星形成星系或受LRD紫外辐射电离的低密度低金属气体。

Background: 小红色点源（LRDs）附近的扩展发射起源尚不明确，可能与宿主星系、邻近伴星系或活动核电离的气体有关。

Data: 使用了JWST UNCOVER和MegaScience巡天数据，包括八个宽带和九个中带滤光片的图像。

Method: 通过同时拟合多波段图像，准确分解扩展发射与主导点源，并结合光度红移拟合和不同红移星系重叠概率分析。

Result: 确认三个扩展发射与LRDs物理相关，其中两个显示出强[O III]发射，表明其可能为受LRD紫外辐射电离的低密度低金属气体；估算出典型重子晕质量吸积率为2-9太阳质量每年。

Abstract: A significant fraction of little red dots (LRDs) exhibit nearby extended
emission of unknown origin. If physically associated with the LRD, this
component may trace stellar emission from an off-centered host galaxy,
neighboring companions, or nebular gas illuminated by the active nucleus. We
investigate the detailed spectral energy distribution of the extended emission
near four LRDs in the JWST UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys. We accurately
decompose the extended emission from the dominant point source by
simultaneously fitting the images in eight broad-band and nine medium-band
filters. After considering both the results from photometric redshift fitting
and the probability of galaxies at different redshift overlapping, we confirm
that the off-centered blobs in three sources are physically associated with the
LRDs, with two of them showing strong [\ion{O}{3}] $\lambda\lambda 4959,\,5007$
emission captured by the medium-band filters. While the spectral energy
distributions of all three blobs can be modeled assuming star-forming galaxies
with stellar mass $\sim 10^8\,M_{\odot}$, the exceptionally strong [\ion{O}{3}]
emission of two sources is best interpreted as pure nebular emission from
low-density ($n<10\, {\rm cm}^{-3}$), low-metallicity ($Z\approx
0.05\,Z_{\odot}$) gas photoionized by the ultraviolet radiation from the nearby
LRD. Adopting LRD halo masses constrained by clustering measurements and
theoretical considerations, we estimate a typical baryonic halo mass accretion
rate of $\sim 2-9\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. If the halo accretion rate is
sustained to $z=4$ and stars form with an efficiency of 10\%, the accreted gas
would form a galaxy with stellar mass $\sim 10^9\,M_{\odot}$, potentially
rendering them spatially resolved at lower redshift.

*S Amrutha,Mousumi Das*

**TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种估计星系中高质量初始质量函数（IMF）的方法，并将其应用于NGC 628的不同区域（臂、臂间和刺突），发现IMF指数在不同区域变化不显著，但与星形成复合体的某些特性相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究背景包括当前对星系中高质量初始质量函数（IMF）的理解不足，以及通过多波段观测（如Hα、FUV、NUV和分子气体分布）来探索IMF在不同星系区域的变化。

Data: 使用的数据包括Hα VLT/MUSE观测、UVIT的FUV和NUV观测，以及ALMA的分子气体分布数据。

Method: 方法包括从Hα和UV观测中提取星形成复合体（SFCs），利用O星和B星的寿命差异估计其数量，并通过O到B0和B0到B1的恒星比例推导IMF指数。

Result: 研究发现，假设Hα仅来自O8型星时，IMF指数与经典值一致；当考虑质量更大的O星时，IMF指数变陡。此外，IMF指数与SFCs的特性（如消光校正后的UV颜色）相关，但在臂和刺突区域的变化不显著。

Abstract: We present a pilot method to estimate the high-mass initial mass function
(IMF) across the arm, interarm, and spur regions in galaxies and apply it to
NGC 628. We extracted star-forming complexes (SFCs) from H$\alpha$ VLT/MUSE and
UVIT (FUV and NUV) observations of NGC 628 and used ALMA observations to define
the molecular gas distribution. We find that the extinction-corrected H$\alpha$
and FUV luminosities correlate well. Using the fact that O stars have a shorter
lifetime (10$^7$ yr) compared to B stars (10$^8$ yr), we estimated the
approximate number of O stars from H$\alpha$ emission, and the number of B0
($M_{*} > 10 M_{\odot}$), and B1 ($10 M_{\odot} \geq M_{*} \geq 3 M_{\odot}$)
stars using FUV, NUV observations. We derived the IMF index ($\alpha$) for
different regions using O to B0 ($\alpha_{1}$) and B0 to B1 ($\alpha_{2}$)
stellar ratios. Our findings indicate that if we assume H$\alpha$ arises only
from O8-type stars, the resulting $\alpha_{1}$ value is consistent with the
canonical IMF index. It steepens when we assume O stars with masses up to 100
$M_{\odot}$ with mean $\alpha_{1}= 3.16 \pm 0.62$. However, the $\alpha_{2}$
does not change for large variations in the O-star population, and the mean
$\alpha= 2.64 \pm 0.14$. When we include only blue SFCs ($ FUV-NUV\leq0.3$),
mean $\alpha_{2}$ is $2.43 \pm 0.06$. The IMF variation for SFCs in arms and
spurs is insignificant. We also find that $\alpha_{2}$ correlates with
different properties of the SFCs, the most prominent being the
extinction-corrected UV color (FUV-NUV).

Abstract: Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) are a distinct category of jetted active
galactic nuclei (AGN) whose optical variability characteristics have not been
well investigated. We present here the results of our investigation on the
optical flux and colour variability properties of a bona fide sample of 38
CSOs. We used the g-, r- and i-bands data from the Zwicky Transient Facility
survey that spans a duration of about 5 years. We also considered a comparison
sub-sample of blazars that includes 5 flat spectrum radio quasars and 12 BL Lac
objects with redshifts and g-band magnitudes similar to the limited sub-sample
of 9 CSOs. These two sub-samples of AGN, chosen for this comparative study of
their long-term optical variability, represent different orientations of their
relativistic jets with respect to the observer. We found that both CSOs and
blazars exhibit optical flux variations, although variability of CSOs is lower
than that of blazars. The observed variability in both CSOs and blazars is
attributed to the relativistic jets and the increased optical variations in
blazars relative to CSOs are likely due to beaming effects. CSOs and blazars
exhibit similar colour variations, with both of them showing a bluer when
brighter trend. Such a colour variability pattern is expected due to processes
associated with their relativistic jets.

Background: 高质量恒星形成区Sgr B2(N)的化学成分研究对于理解恒星形成过程中的化学演化具有重要意义。现有研究在化学差异性和宇宙射线电离率等方面存在不足，需要进一步探索。

Data: ALMA对Sgr B2(N)的谱线调查数据，特别是热核Sgr B2(N2)中嵌入源的光谱数据。

Method: 在局部热力学平衡（LTE）假设下对光谱进行建模，并与化学动力学模型MAGICKAL及文献中的其他源进行比较。

Result: 检测到58种分子，包括24种复杂有机分子（COMs），揭示了化学成分的差异性和高宇宙射线电离率，并发现N-bearing分子对冲击和非热解吸过程更敏感。

Abstract: We used ALMA to perform a line survey of the high-mass star forming region
Sgr B2(N), called ReMoCA. We modeled under the assumption of LTE the spectra
obtained toward the sources embedded in the secondary hot core Sgr B2(N2). We
compared the chemical composition of these sources to that of sources from the
literature and to predictions of the chemical kinetics model MAGICKAL. We
detected up to 58 molecules toward Sgr B2(N2)'s hot cores, including up to 24
COMs, as well as many less abundant isotopologs. The compositions of some pairs
of sources are well correlated, but differences also exist in particular for
HNCO and NH2CHO. The abundances of series of homologous molecules drop by about
one order of magnitude at each further step in complexity. The nondetection of
radicals yields stringent constraints on the models. The comparison to the
chemical models confirms previous evidence of a high cosmic-ray ionization rate
in Sgr B2(N). The comparison to sources from the literature gives new insight
into chemical differentiation. The composition of most hot cores of Sgr B2(N2)
is tightly correlated to that of the hot core G31.41+0.31 and the hot corino
IRAS 16293-2422B after normalizing the abundances by classes of molecules (O-,
N-, O+N-, and S-bearing). There is no overall correlation between Sgr B2(N2)
and the shocked region G+0.693-0.027 also located in Sgr B2, and even less with
the cold starless core TMC-1. The class of N-bearing species reveals the
largest variance among the four classes of molecules. The S-bearing class shows
in contrast the smallest variance. These results imply that the class of
N-bearing molecules reacts more sensitively to shocks, low-temperature gas
phase chemistry after non-thermal desorption, or density. The abundance shifts
observed between the N- and O-bearing molecules may indicate how violently and
completely the ice mantles are desorbed. [abridged]

Background: 蓝水平分支（BHB）恒星是测绘银河系恒星晕结构的理想示踪体，但传统基于光谱特征的BHB样本规模有限。

Data: 使用Gaia XP光谱卷积得到的SkyMapper测光系统的合成颜色（u-v）0和（g-i）0数据。

Method: 基于合成颜色构建BHB恒星星表，利用球状星团成员星校准距离关系，并探讨CSST测光数据在区分BHB与蓝离散星（BS）方面的潜力。

Result: 构建了一个包含49,733颗BHB恒星的星表，距离精度为0.11星等（对应5%的距离不确定性），并验证了CSST在探测外晕BHB恒星方面的可行性。

Abstract: Blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars are ideal tracers for mapping the
structure of Galactic stellar halo. Traditionally, BHB sample stars are built
from large-scale spectroscopic surveys utilizing their spectral features,
however, the resulting sample sizes have been quite limited. In this paper, we
construct a catalog of BHB stars based on synthetic colors $(u-v)_{0}$ and
$(g-i)_{0}$ in SkyMapper photometric systems, which are convolved from Gaia XP
spectra. A total of 49,733 BHB stars are selected from nearly the entire sky
(excluding regions of low Galactic latitudes $|b| \le 8^{\circ}$ with heavy
reddening), with a completeness and purity exceeding 90\%. Using member stars
of globular clusters with precise distance determinations, we carefully
calibrate the relationship between the $g$-band absolute magnitude and
$(g-i)_{0}$, achieving a precision of 0.11\,mag, which corresponds to a 5\%
uncertainty in distance. This relation is applied to derive distances for all
BHB stars in the constructed sample. Given current capabilities of Gaia XP
observations, the constructed BHB sample is primarily located within 20 kpc,
enabling detailed mapping of the inner stellar halo. To extend this depth to
the outer halo or even the edge of our Galaxy, we explore the potential of the
Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) and its broad-band photometry for
detecting BHB stars. Using mock data from synthetic spectra, we find that it is
feasible to distinguish BHB stars from blue stragglers (BS) stars using CSST
near-ultraviolet bands ($NUV, u$) photometry. Thanks to the deep limiting
magnitude of CSST, its data will provide a groundbreaking perspective on our
Galaxy, particularly regarding the outer halo, in an unprecedented volume.

Result: 研究发现CN和CCH衍生物的形成路径是放热且无净活化能，而OH衍生物的形成较不有利；c-C4H3CN和c-C4H3CCH可能成为星际探测的候选分子。

Abstract: The study of cyclic hydrocarbons is of utmost relevance in current
astrochemical research, as they are considered to be among the most significant
reservoirs of carbon in the interstellar medium. However, while unsaturated
cyclic hydrocarbons with three, five, and six carbon atoms have been widely
investigated, the highly strained antiaromatic cyclobutadiene, c-C4H4, still
remains uncharted. Here, we employed high-level
CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12//B2PLYPD3/aug-cc-pVTZ theoretical calculations to
analyze whether the cyano (CN), ethynyl (CCH), and hydroxy (OH) derivatives of
c-C4H4 and its structural isomers butatriene (H2CCCCH2) and vinylacetylene
(H2CCHCCH) can readily form via the gas-phase reaction: C4H4 + X -> C4H3X + H
(where X = CN, CCH, and OH). For each system, we thoroughly explored the
corresponding potential energy surfaces, identifying their critical points to
enable a detailed analysis of the thermochemistry. Hence, we found various
exothermic pathways for the formation of CN and CCH derivatives of butatriene
and vinylacetylene, with no net activation barriers, while the formation of the
OH derivatives is in general less favorable. Prior to the mechanistic study, we
also analyzed the complete conformational panorama and stability of all the
derivatives at the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 level. Overall, c-C4H3CN and
c-C4H3CCH emerge as particularly promising candidates for interstellar
detection, provided that the parental c-C4H4 is present in the gas phase. These
findings highlight the potential for detecting polar derivatives of c-C4H4 as
indirect evidence of its presence in the ISM, as it appears to be "invisible"
to radioastronomical observations. Also, this study underscores the need for
future laboratory and theoretical efforts to characterize the spectroscopic
properties of the proposed derivatives, paving the way for their eventual
identification in space.

*M. Orienti,F. D'Ammando,D. Dallacasa,G. Migliori,P. Rossi,G. Bodo*

**TL;DR**: A new sample of low-power compact symmetric objects (CSOs) is identified from the FIRST survey, filling a gap in the radio power-size plane, with 12 confirmed CSOs showing jet power estimates of 10^44-10^45 erg s^-1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) are compact extragalactic radio sources considered progenitors of classical radio galaxies, with evolutionary models primarily focusing on high-power sources, leaving low-power objects less studied despite their potential jet instabilities.

Data: Data from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) survey and archival Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images were used, with VLBA total flux density consistency as a key criterion.

Method: Selection criteria included parsec-scale double radio morphology from VLBA images and flux density consistency between VLBA and FIRST. VLBA observations at 4.98 GHz were conducted on a sub-sample of 20 sources to confirm CSO classification.

Result: The study identified 60 candidate low-power CSOs, with 12 confirmed based on radio structure and spectral index, revealing jet power estimates of 10^44-10^45 erg s^-1 and no evidence of jet-cloud interaction in some cases.

Abstract: Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) are intrinsically compact extragalactic
radio sources that are thought to be the progenitors of classical radio
galaxies. To date, evolutionary models have mainly focused on the formation and
growth of high-power radio sources, leaving unanswered many questions related
to low-power objects, whose relativistic jets are likely more prone to
instabilities. We present a new sample of candidate low-power CSOs selected
from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) survey. The main
selection criteria are (i) a parsec-scale double radio morphology from archival
Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images and (ii) a VLBA total flux density
consistent with that from the FIRST survey, which rules out the presence of
significant radio emission extending beyond the parsec scale. The final sample
consists of 60 sources with radio luminosities between 10$^{24}$ and 10$^{27}$
W Hz$^{-1}$ at 1.4 GHz and projected linear sizes between 45 and 430 pc, which
fill a region in the radio power-size plane that is currently underpopulated.
We carried out VLBA observations at 4.98 GHz of a sub-sample of 20 sources
among the brightest candidate CSOs with the aim of confirming their
classification. We classify 12 sources as CSOs on the basis of their radio
structure and spectral index distribution. In two out of the four CSOs with
core identification, the asymmetry in the flux density of the outer components
is in agreement with light travel time effects, and there is no evidence of
jet-cloud interaction. If we assume a simplistic parametric model, most of the
sources in the total sample have a jet power of $\sim 10^{44} - 10^{45}$ erg
s$^{-1}$, making their evolutionary paths sensitive to the individual
conditions of the jet and its environment.

Abstract: Deuterated molecules can be used to study the physical conditions and the
astro-chemical evolution of molecular clouds. large-sample surveys for
deuterated molecules are needed to understand the enhancement of deuterated
molecules from diffuse molecular gas to cold cores. A single-pointing survey
toward the 559 Planck cold clumps of the Early Cold Core Catalogue (ECC) has
been conducted using the Arizona Radio Observatory 12-meter telescope, focusing
on the $J$=1-0 transitions of DCO$^+$ and DCN. The survey included observations
of 309 cores for DCO$^+$ and DCN 1-0 simultaneously, followed by 71 of these
cores where DCO$^+$ 1-0 was detected for H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CN 1-0
simultaneously, aiming to determine the deuterated fraction ($D_{\rm frac}$).
Additionally, 250 cores were observed for DCO$^+$, DCN, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and
H$^{13}$CN 1-0 simultaneously. Among the 309 sources, DCO$^+$ and DCN 1-0 were
detected in 79 and 11 sources, with a detection rates of 25.6 % and 3.6 %
respectively. In the 250 sources observed for all four species, DCO$^+$, DCN,
H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CN 1-0 were detected in 58, 9, 57 and 13 sources,
with a detection rate of 23.2 %, 3.6 %, 22.8 % and 5.2 % respectively. The
$D_{\rm frac}$(HCO$^+$) values in 112 sources range from 0.89 % to 7.4 % with a
median value of 3.1 %, while $D_{\rm frac}$(HCN) values in 11 sources range
from 1.5 % to 5.5 % with a median value of 2.3 %. The line widths of DCO$^+$
and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ 1-0 detections are mostly within 1 km s$^{-1}$. The
similarity in $D_{\rm frac}$ values between HCO$^+$ and HCN indicates that the
higher detection rate of DCO$^+$ 1-0 compared with DCN 1-0 is due to the lower
critical density of DCO$^+$ 1-0. We suggest that the enhancement of DCO$^+$ and
DCN likely begins in the early diffuse stage of the molecular cloud, rather
than during the cold core formation stage.

Result: 测得WLM的距离模数为24.977±0.018（统计误差）±0.056（系统误差）星等，Sextans A的距离模数为25.740±0.011（统计误差）±0.057（系统误差）星等，结果与先前测量一致，未来有望将TRGB距离不确定性降至2%以下。

Abstract: Distance measurements to extragalactic systems that are both accurate and
precise are cornerstones of modern astrophysics, underpinning the calibration
of standard candles and the determination of the Hubble constant. Dwarf
galaxies, such as Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM) and Sextans A, provide valuable
laboratories for testing distance scales across different stellar populations.
In this work, we utilize the high sensitivity and spatial resolution of the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to measure the distances to WLM and Sextans A
using the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method. Adopting the TRGB absolute
magnitude calibrated by NGC 4258, we determine distance moduli of
$\mu_{\mathrm{0,WLM}} = 24.977 \pm 0.018 (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.056
(\mathrm{sys})$ mag for WLM and $\mu_{\mathrm{0,SexA}} = 25.740 \pm 0.011
(\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.057 (\mathrm{sys})$ mag for Sextans A. Our results are
consistent within a 3% distance uncertainty with previous measurements based on
TRGB, Cepheids, and J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) methods. With
improved distance measurements in the future, these two galaxies have the
potential to serve as additional anchor points for TRGB calibration, aiming to
reduce the TRGB-based distance uncertainty to below 2%.

*Dongliang Yang,Mingxu Sun,Biwei Jiang,Wenyuan Cui,Ruoyi Zhang,Luyao Shi,Jiachen Wei*

**TL;DR**: 该研究利用光谱数据和多种紫外波段的光度数据，结合随机森林算法，建立了恒星参数与紫外颜色指数的经验关系，并构建了覆盖大部分天空的紫外消光图，揭示了紫外与光学波段在消光行为上的显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域在紫外波段的消光行为研究相对不足，尤其是在恒星参数对紫外颜色指数的影响方面缺乏系统性分析。本研究旨在填补这一空白，通过结合多种数据和方法，提供更全面的紫外消光信息。

Data: 研究使用了来自光谱巡天和Zhang等人的恒星参数数据（基于Gaia XP光谱），以及GALEX、UVOT和Gaia的光度数据。

Method: 研究采用了蓝边方法结合随机森林算法，建立了恒星参数与紫外颜色指数的经验关系，并利用观测颜色指数推导出紫外颜色超量。

Result: 研究获得了GALEX和UVOT多个波段的紫外颜色超量数据，构建了覆盖约三分之二天空的紫外消光图，并发现紫外与光学波段的消光行为存在显著差异，表明单一参数的消光定律可能不足以描述多波段的消光行为。

Abstract: This study employs stellar parameters from spectroscopic surveys and Zhang et
al. based on Gaia XP spectra, along with photometric data from GALEX, UVOT, and
Gaia, to obtain extensive ultraviolet color excess information for the relevant
bands of GALEX and UVOT. By considering the impact of stellar parameters
(\teff, \feh, and \logg) on intrinsic color indices, and utilizing the
blue-edge method combined with a random forest algorithm, an empirical
relationship between stellar parameters and intrinsic ultraviolet color indices
is established. By combining observed color indices, the study derives color
excesses for 11,624,802 and 65,531 stars in the GALEX/near-UV and far-UV bands,
and 336,633, 137,739, and 253,271 stars in the UVOT/\uvwa, \uvmb, and \uvwb\
bands, constructing corresponding ultraviolet extinction maps. Notably, the
color excess data for the GALEX/near-UV band shows a tenfold increase from
previous results, with the extinction map covering approximately two-thirds of
the sky at a resolution of 0.4$^{\circ}$. The typical uncertainties in the
ultraviolet color excesses are 0.21 mag, 0.30 mag, 0.19 mag, 0.24 mag, and 0.21
mag for \enb, \efb, \ewab, \embb, and \ewbb, respectively. By comparing the
spatial distributions of \rv\ derived from ultraviolet and Gaia optical band
measurements with those obtained from infrared and optical data in previous
works, it is evident that the \rv\ distributions based on the ultraviolet data
show noticeable differences, with some regions even exhibiting opposite trends.
This suggests that a single-parameter \rv\ extinction law may not be sufficient
to simultaneously characterize the extinction behavior across infrared,
optical, and ultraviolet bands.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系团在高度各向异性的环境中形成，导致其质量聚集历史（MAH）具有显著多样性。本研究旨在理解暗物质晕和星系团内介质的当前性质如何与其整体演化历史相关。

Data: 使用了一个ΛCDM流体动力学+N体模拟，模拟体积为(100 h^-1 Mpc)^3，包含超过30个星系团和300个星系群。

Method: 分析了模拟数据中的个体和叠加质量聚集历史（MAH），并将其与固定宇宙时间下的暗物质晕和星系团内介质性质相关联。

Result: 研究发现，不同指标揭示了不同时期的吸积信息，且暗物质晕的自旋和组合指标最能反映MAH的多样性。研究还表明，单一指标无法完全捕捉星系团演化的复杂性。

Abstract: Context. Galaxy clusters assemble over gigayears in a very anisotropic
environment, which causes a remarkable diversity in their mass assembly
histories (MAH).
  Aims. In this work, we have aimed to understand how the present-day
properties of the dark matter halo and the intracluster medium are related to
the whole evolution of these structures.
  Methods. To this end, we analysed a $\Lambda$CDM hydrodynamical+$N$-Body
simulation of a $(100 \, h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc})^3$ volume, containing over 30
clusters and 300 groups, and looked at the individual and the stacked MAHs
(determined from complete merger trees) in relation to properties of the DM
haloes and the ICM at fixed cosmic time (indicators of assembly state).
  Results. The ensemble MAHs are well separated when stacked in bins of these
indicators, yielding clear dependencies of evolutionary properties (such as
formation redshift) on fix-time halo properties. Additionally, we find that
different indicators are informative about distinct epochs of accretion.
Finally, by summarising the complex MAH diversity with two parameters, we
describe how different indicators bring complementary information in different
directions of this biparametric space. Overall, halo spin and a combined
indicator appear to be the ones encoding the most information about the MAH.
  Conclusions. The results shown here add up to the idea that the dynamical
state of cosmic structures is a multifaceted concept, and warn that single
indicators are incapable of capturing the whole complexity of the process. This
work sheds light on the nature of this characterisation by untangling precisely
when and how several indicators are informative about. In turn, this can
provide clues to better constrain the MAH of observed structures.

Background: 宇宙细丝的演化研究对于理解大尺度结构的形成和演化具有重要意义，但目前对细丝在不同红移下的动态特性和结构差异的研究仍不充分。

Data: 使用了IllustrisTNG100-1磁流体动力学模拟数据。

Result: 研究发现，连接星系群和星系团的细丝在质量密度对比径向剖面上存在显著差异，且具有不同加权平均速度的细丝在演化趋势上表现出不同特征。

Abstract: This paper examines the evolution of cosmic filaments across redshifts 1,
0.5, and 0 using the IllustrisTNG100-1 magneto-hydrodynamical simulation. To
achieve this, we introduce GrAviPaSt, a simple and efficient filament
identification method that leverages gravitational potential, an A*-like
path-finding algorithm, and spanning trees. Applying this method to galaxy
distributions at different redshifts allows us to analyze various filament
properties, including their length, thickness, mass density contrast, and
radial profile. Additionally, we investigate dynamic characteristics such as
the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton, their weighted mean
velocity, and velocity trends normalized by their positions within the
filaments. Our findings reveal the evolution of cosmic filaments from redshift
1 to 0, highlighting key differences across classifications. In particular, we
examine the mass density contrast radial profile of filaments connecting two
galaxy groups and those linking two galaxy clusters, identifying distinct
differences in profile shape between these categories. Furthermore, in the
context of weighted mean velocity, we analyze cosmic filaments exhibiting
either negative or positive weighted mean velocity, demonstrating their
differing evolutionary trends in terms of the mean distance of filament
galaxies from the skeleton.

<details>

Background: 天文学中重子物质缺失的问题尚未解决，快速射电暴的色散测量（DM）可以揭示这些缺失的重子物质，但其与宇宙结构的关系尚未得到统计验证。

Data: 使用了14个和13个定位的快速射电暴（FRBs）的数据，分别结合WISE-PS1-STRM和WISE x SCOS光度红移星系目录测量前景星系密度。

Method: 通过比较半径为1 Mpc的随机孔径测量前景星系密度，并分析其与色散测量（DM_cosmic）的关系。

Result: 发现DM_cosmic与前景星系密度之间存在显著正相关，表明星系密度高的区域重子物质密度超过宇宙平均值，而低密度区域重子物质较少，支持重子物质在宇宙尺度上波动的统计证据。

Abstract: Aims: The enigma of the missing baryons poses a prominent and unresolved
problem in astronomy. Dispersion measures (DM) serve as a distinctive
observable of fast radio bursts (FRBs). They quantify the electron column
density along each line of sight and reveal the missing baryons that are
described in the Macquart (DM-z) relation. The scatter of this relation is
anticipated to be caused by the variation in the cosmic structure. This is not
yet statistically confirmed, however. We present statistical evidence that the
cosmological baryons fluctuate. Methods: We measured the foreground galaxy
number densities around 14 and 13 localized FRBs with the WISE-PS1-STRM and
WISE x SCOS photometric redshift galaxy catalog, respectively. The foreground
galaxy number densities were determined through a comparison with measured
random apertures with a radius of 1 Mpc. Results: We found a positive
correlation between the excess of DM that is contributed by the medium outside
galaxies (DM_cosmic) and the foreground galaxy number density. The correlation
is strong and statistically significant, with median Pearson coefficients of
0.6 and 0.6 and median p-values of 0.012 and 0.032 for the galaxy catalogs,
respectively, as calculated with Monte Carlo simulations. Conclusions: Our
findings indicate that the baryonic matter density outside galaxies exceeds its
cosmic average along the line of sight to regions with an excess galaxy
density, but there are fewer baryons along the line of sight to low-density
regions. This is statistical evidence that the ionized baryons fluctuate
cosmologically on a characteristic scale of $\lesssim$6 Mpc.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系团是宇宙中最大的引力束缚结构，其动力学特性对于理解结构形成和演化至关重要。CHEX-MATE项目旨在通过XMM-Newton观测研究星系团的质量组装和热力学性质。

Data: 研究使用了CHEX-MATE星系团样本中75个星系团的成员星系视线速度和投影位置数据。

Method: 采用MG-MAMPOSSt方法恢复引力势和各向异性分布，并比较了NFW和Burkert模型对运动学数据的拟合效果。通过SZ-X射线校准质量估计计算质量偏差，并评估了动力学状态（Anderson-Darling系数和子结构星系比例）。

Result: 研究发现NFW和Burkert模型均能较好地拟合数据，质量偏差估计为0.54±0.11（排除四个明显扰动的星系团后）。动力学状态分析表明CHEX-MATE星系团接近弛豫状态，浓度-质量关系显示出大质量星系团浓度增加的趋势。成员星系的轨道在中心各向同性，边缘趋向径向分布，且速度弥散较大的星系团在r200处径向轨道比例略高。

Abstract: We analyse the kinematical properties of the CHEX-MATE (Cluster HEritage
project with XMM-Newton - Mass Assembly and Thermodynamics at the Endpoint of
structure formation) galaxy cluster sample. [...] We derive cluster mass
profiles for 75 clusters using the \textsc{MG-MAMPOSSt} procedure, which
recovers the gravitational potential and the anisotropy profiles from
line-of-sight velocities and projected positions of galaxy members. The
standard NFW and the Burkert models with flatter cores than NFW both adequately
fit the kinematic data, with only marginal statistical preference for one model
over the other. An estimation of the mass bias $(1-B_1) =
M^{SZ}_{500}/M^{M}_{500} $ is performed from the comparison with
SZ-X-ray-calibrated mass estimates, resulting in a value of $ 0.54 \pm 0.11$
when four evidently disturbed clusters are removed from the sample. We assess
the dynamical state of the clusters by inferring the Anderson-Darling
coefficient $(A^2)$ and the fraction of galaxies in substructures
($f_\text{sub}$). Except for a few cases, we found relatively low values for
$A^2$, suggesting that CHEX-MATE clusters are not too far from relaxation.
Moreover, no significant trends emerge among $A^2,\,f_\text{sub}$ and the
difference between the log-masses estimated by \textsc{MG-MAMPOSSt} and by
SZ-X-ray.
  We study the concentration-mass relation for the sample; despite the large
scatter, we observe signs of an increasing trend for large-mass clusters, in
agreement with recent theoretical expectations.
  Finally, the analysis of radial anisotropy profiles of member galaxies -
stacked in five bins of mass and redshift - reveals that orbits tend to be
isotropic at the center and more radial towards the edge, as already found in
previous studies. A slight trend of increasing radial orbits at $r_{200}$ is
observed in clusters with larger velocity dispersion

Abstract: We combine simulations with new analyses that overcome previous pitfalls to
explicate how nonhelical mean-field dynamos grow and saturate in unstratified,
magnetorotationally driven turbulence. Shear of the mean radial magnetic field
amplifies the azimuthal component. Radial fields are regenerated by velocity
fluctuations that induce shear of radial magnetic fluctuations, followed by
Lorentz and Coriolis forces that source a negative off-diagonal component in
the turbulent diffusivity tensor. We present a simple schematic to illustrate
this dynamo growth. A different part of the Lorentz force forms a third-order
correlator in the mean electromotive force that saturates the dynamo.

*Jing-Ze Ma,Rob Farmer,Selma E. de Mink,Eva Laplace*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过MESA模拟发现，金属丰度是影响大质量恒星碳产量的主要因素，而双星剥离恒星在低金属丰度下的碳产量与单星相似，无法解释贫金属碳增强恒星或高红移星系的碳富集现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 宇宙中碳的来源尚不明确，此前研究表明在太阳金属丰度下，双星剥离大质量恒星的碳产量是单星的两倍，但需要研究不同金属丰度下的恒星产量以理解星系的化学演化。

Data: 使用MESA模拟计算了初始质量（10-46太阳质量）、金属丰度（Z=0.0021,0.0047,0.0142）和初始轨道周期（10-5000天）范围内的单星和双星剥离恒星的碳产量。

Method: 利用恒星演化代码MESA模拟了风质量损失和超新星爆炸对碳产量的影响。

Result: 金属丰度是影响碳产量的主要因素，双星剥离恒星在低金属丰度下的碳产量与单星相似，无法解释贫金属碳增强恒星或高红移星系的碳富集现象。

Abstract: The origin of carbon in the Universe remains uncertain. At solar metallicity,
binary-stripped massive stars -- stars that lost their envelope through stable
interaction with a companion -- have been suggested to produce twice as much
carbon as their single-star counterparts. However, understanding the chemical
evolution of galaxies over cosmic time requires examining stellar yields across
a range of metallicities. Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we compute the
carbon yields from wind mass loss and supernova explosions of single and
binary-stripped stars across a wide range of initial masses
($10$-$46,M_\odot$), metallicities ($Z = 0.0021$, $0.0047$, $0.0142$), and
initial orbital periods ($10$-$5000$ days). We find that metallicity is the
dominant factor influencing the carbon yields of massive stars, outweighing the
effects of binarity and detailed orbital parameters. Since the chemical yields
from binary massive stars are highly sensitive to metallicity, we caution that
yields predicted at solar metallicity should not be directly extrapolated to
lower metallicities. At sub-solar metallicities, particularly below $1/7$
solar, weak stellar winds and inefficient binary stripping result in carbon
yields from binary-stripped stars that closely resemble those of single stars.
This suggests that binary-stripped massive stars are unlikely to explain the
presence of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars or the carbon enrichment observed
in high-redshift galaxies as probed by the James Webb Space Telescope. Our
findings only concern the stripped stars in massive binaries. The impact of
other outcomes of binary star evolution, in particular stellar mergers and
accretors, remains largely unexplored but will be necessary for a full
understanding of the role of massive binaries in nucleosynthesis.

**TL;DR**: 研究极低金属丰度（Z）下超大质量恒星（VMS）的光谱特征及其对星暴积分光的影响，发现VMS的演化强烈依赖于质量损失率的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域关注极低金属丰度下超大质量恒星的光谱特征及其对星暴积分光的影响，但现有研究对VMS质量损失率的依赖性存在争议。

Data: 使用金属丰度为0.2、0.1和0.01 Zsun的150、200、250和300 Msun恒星模型数据。

Method: 采用两种质量损失率框架（无Z依赖性和线性Z依赖性），计算VMS的演化模型和合成光谱，并构建包含VMS的群体合成模型。

Result: VMS的演化强烈依赖于质量损失率假设；HeII 1640发射线在大多数演化阶段出现；VMS的存在增加了低Z下的电离光子数量；模型能定性和定量重现恒星形成区域的UV光谱，但无法明确优选质量损失率框架。

Abstract: We study the spectroscopic appearance of very massive stars and their effect
on the integrated light of starbursts at low metallicity (Z). We adopt two
frameworks for the mass loss rates of VMS: in one case we assume no Z
dependence, in the other case we assume a linear scaling with Z. We compute
evolutionary models for masses 150, 200, 250 and 300 Msun at Z=0.2, 0.1 and
0.01 Zsun. We compute the associated synthetic spectra at selected points along
the evolutionary tracks. Finally we build population synthesis models including
VMS. We find that the evolution of VMS critically depends on the assumptions
regarding mass loss rates. In case of no Z dependence VMS remain hot for all
their lifetime. Conversely when mass loss rates are reduced because of lower Z
VMS follow a classical evolution towards the red part of the HR diagram. VMS
display HeII 1640 emission in most phases of their evolution, except when they
become too cool. This line is present in the integrated light of population
synthesis models down to 0.1 Zsun whatever the star formation history, and is
also sometimes seen at Z=0.01 Zsun. HeII 1640 is weaker in models that include
a Z scaling of the mass loss rates. The optical spectra of starbursts,
especially the Wolf-Rayet bumps, sometimes display VMS signatures when these
stars are present. At low Z, adding VMS to population synthesis models produces
more ionising photons down to 45 eV. At higher energy the ionising flux depends
on age, Z, assumption regarding VMS mass loss rates, and on the very short
phases at the end of VMS evolution. HeII ionising fluxes large enough to
produce some amount of nebular HeII 4686 emission can be produced under
specific circumstances. Our models are able to reproduce qualitatively and
sometimes also quantitatively the UV spectra of star-forming regions. However
we are not able to clearly identify which mass loss framework is favoured.

Data: 使用了2dF/HERMES光谱仪在英澳望远镜上获取的光谱数据，并结合Gaia EDR3的5参数天体测量数据。

Result: 研究发现上蝎座亚群更可能通过自不稳定性或外部反馈独立形成，而非相互触发的'星团链'情景，并测量了各群组的膨胀时间尺度和最紧凑构型时间。

Abstract: We present results from a large spectroscopic survey of the nearest young
association to the Sun, Upper Scorpius, conducted using 2dF/HERMES on the
Anglo-Australian Telescope. We use spectroscopic youth criteria such as
Li-equivalent widths to identify >1000 pre-main sequence (PMS) members across
the region and measure radial velocities, combining these with Gaia EDR3
5-parameter astrometry to obtain 6D kinematic information. We separate
confirmed PMS association members into distinct kinematic groups and measure
expansion and rotation trends in each. We find strong evidence for asymmetric
expansion in several groups and derive expansion timescales from the greatest
rates of expansion in each group. We also trace the past motion of these groups
using an epicycle approximation and estimate the time since their most compact
configuration. These kinematic properties are compared to literature ages and
the star formation history of Upper Scorpius is discussed. We find evidence
that a scenario in which star formation in the subgroups of Upper Scorpius
proceeded independently, either by self-instability or external feedback from
Upper Centaurus-Lupus, is more likely than a recently proposed "cluster chain"
scenario in which these subgroups have triggered each other.

Abstract: Virtually all extragalactic use cases of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's
Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) require the use of galaxy redshift
information, yet the vast majority of its sample of tens of billions of
galaxies will lack high-fidelity spectroscopic measurements thereof, instead
relying on photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) subject to systematic imprecision
and inaccuracy best encapsulated by photo-$z$ probability density functions
(PDFs). We present the version 1 release of Redshift Assessment Infrastructure
Layers (RAIL), an open source Python library for at-scale probabilistic
photo-$z$ estimation, initiated by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration
(DESC) with contributions from the LSST Interdisciplinary Network for
Collaboration and Computing (LINCC) Frameworks team. RAIL's three subpackages
provide modular tools for end-to-end stress-testing, including a forward
modeling suite to generate realistically complex photometry, a unified API for
estimating per-galaxy and ensemble redshift PDFs by an extensible set of
algorithms, and built-in metrics of both photo-$z$ PDFs and point estimates.
RAIL serves as a flexible toolkit enabling the derivation and optimization of
photo-$z$ data products at scale for a variety of science goals and is not
specific to LSST data. We thus describe to the extragalactic science community,
including and beyond Rubin the design and functionality of the RAIL software
library so that any researcher may have access to its wide array of photo-$z$

Abstract: Astronomical archives contain vast quantities of unexplored data that
potentially harbour rare and scientifically valuable cosmological phenomena. We
have systematically searched approximately 100 million image cutouts from the
entire Hubble Legacy Archive using the recently developed AnomalyMatch method,
which combines semi-supervised and active learning techniques for the efficient
detection of astrophysical anomalies. This comprehensive search rapidly
uncovered a multitude of astrophysical anomalies presented here that
significantly expand the inventory of known rare objects. Among our discoveries
are 138 new candidate gravitational lenses, 18 jellyfish galaxies, and 417
mergers or interacting galaxes. The efficiency and accuracy of our iterative
detection strategy allows us to trawl the complete archive within just 2-3
days, highlighting its potential for large-scale astronomical surveys. We
present a detailed overview of these newly identified objects, discuss their
astrophysical significance, and demonstrate the considerable potential of
AnomalyMatch to efficiently explore extensive astronomical datasets, e.g.,
upcoming Euclid data releases.

**TL;DR**: 本文研究了IIb型超新星SN 2024uwq的早期多波段光度和光谱观测，揭示了其前身星为部分剥离的蓝/黄超巨星，并强调了双星质量转移效率在塑造剥离包层前身星连续谱中的重要性。

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: IIb型超新星的研究对于理解大质量恒星的演化路径和剥离包层机制具有重要意义。当前研究通过早期观测揭示前身星的性质，但对其多样性及其与双星相互作用的联系仍需进一步探索。

Data: 研究使用了SN 2024uwq的早期多波段光度和光谱观测数据，包括H-alpha和He I P-Cygni谱线。

Method: 通过分析早期激波冷却发射和辐射光曲线，结合解析模型，对前身星的半径和质量进行了约束。

Result: 研究发现SN 2024uwq的前身星是一个部分剥离的恒星，半径在10到60太阳半径之间，初始ZAMS质量为12到20太阳质量，可能是通过双星相互作用剥离的。SN 2024uwq处于紧凑型和扩展型IIb超新星之间的过渡位置。

Abstract: We present early multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic observations
of the Type IIb supernova SN 2024uwq, capturing its shock-cooling emission
phase and double-peaked light curve evolution. Early spectra reveal broad
H-alpha (v ~ 15,500 km s$^{-1}$) and He I P-Cygni profiles of similar
strengths. Over time the He I lines increase in strength while the H-alpha
decreases, consistent with a hydrogen envelope ($M_{env}$ = 0.7 - 1.35
$M_\odot$ ) overlying helium-rich ejecta. Analytic modeling of early shock
cooling emission and bolometric light analysis constrains the progenitor to a
partially stripped star with radius R = 10 - 60 $R_\odot$, consistent with a
blue/yellow supergiant with an initial ZAMS mass of 12 - 20 $M_\odot$ , likely
stripped via binary interaction. SN 2024uwq occupies a transitional position
between compact and extended Type IIb supernovae, highlighting the role of
binary mass-transfer efficiency in shaping a continuum of stripped-envelope
progenitors. Our results underscore the importance of both early UV/optical
observations to characterize shock breakout signatures critical to map the
diversity in evolutionary pathways of massive stars. Upcoming time domain
surveys including Rubin Observatory's LSST and UV missions like ULTRASAT and
UVEX will revolutionise our ability to systematically capture these early
signatures, probing the full diversity of stripped progenitors and their
explosive endpoints.

### [35] [Radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulation of minidisks in equal-mass massive black hole binaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02919)
*Chi-Ho Chan,Vishal Tiwari,Tamara Bogdanović,Yan-Fei Jiang,Shane W. Davis*

**TL;DR**: 本文通过辐射磁流体动力学模拟研究了双超大质量黑洞周围微盘的光学特征，发现其辐射通量随轨道周期变化，可能为未来光学瞬变巡天和引力波探测提供新的识别标志。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 双超大质量黑洞（MBHBs）的引力波探测即将成为现实，而其周围的环双星盘和微盘的电磁辐射对于定位MBHBs至关重要。目前对微盘的研究仍存在不足，特别是辐射效应的直接影响尚未充分探索。

Data: 模拟数据基于一个质量为2乘以10的7次方太阳质量、间距为100引力半径的等质量双超大质量黑洞系统中的一个微盘。

Method: 采用辐射磁流体动力学（RMHD）模拟方法，直接在离散化网格射线上求解辐射传输方程，比较了有辐射效应和无辐射效应的微盘模拟结果。

Result: 研究发现，RMHD微盘比传统磁流体动力学微盘更密集且几何上更薄，其非轴对称光球和温度分布导致各向异性辐射模式，观测到的辐射通量以轨道周期的一半变化，这一特征独立于相对论增强和透镜效应。

Abstract: We are on the cusp of detecting gravitational waves (GWs) from individual
massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
and pulsar-timing arrays. These MBHBs may be surrounded by circumbinary disks
and minidisks, the electromagnetic emission from which are essential for
localizing the MBHBs on the sky. Here we present the first radiative
magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) minidisk simulation that directly solves the
radiative transfer equation on discretized grid rays. The simulation examines
one of the minidisks in an equal-mass $2\times10^7\,M_\odot$ MBHB separated by
100 gravitational radii. Minidisks simulated with and without radiative effects
resemble each other qualitatively but differ in several key aspects. The RMHD
minidisk is denser and geometrically thinner than the magnetohydrodynamics
minidisk. Furthermore, the RMHD minidisk, with a nonaxisymmetric photosphere
and temperature distribution, produces an anisotropic illumination pattern. As
a result, the observed radiative flux of two RMHD minidisks orbiting each other
varies at half the binary orbital period, a feature independent of relativistic
boosting and lensing effects. Such periodic light curves, if identified in
upcoming optical transient surveys, could reveal the existence of MBHBs on the
way to merger, particularly if they are in a constant phase relation with
detected GWs.

### [36] [Evidence of a fraction of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA events coming from active galactic nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02924)
*Liang-Gui Zhu,Xian Chen*

**TL;DR**: 通过分析LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA探测到的引力波事件与AGN分布的空间相关性，研究发现低光度或低吸积率的AGN可能是引力波源的重要宿主。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA（LVK）探测到的引力波源的形成机制尚不明确，活动星系核（AGN）被认为是潜在的宿主之一，但AGN起源的引力波事件比例尚未量化。

Data: 使用了LVK的O1-O4a引力波源定位数据和SDSS DR16的AGN分布数据。

Method: 通过分析引力波源与AGN分布的空间相关性，并利用蒙特卡洛模拟验证结果的显著性。

Result: 研究发现低光度（L_bol ≤ 10^45 erg/s）和低爱丁顿比（λ_Edd ≤ 0.05）的AGN在引力波事件周围存在过量分布，表明约39%和29%的LVK事件可能分别起源于这些AGN群体。

Abstract: The formation channels of the gravitational-wave (GW) sources detected by
LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) remain poorly constrained. Active galactic nucleus (AGN)
has been proposed as one of the potential hosts but the fraction of GW events
originating from AGNs has not been quantified. Here, we constrain the
AGN-origin fraction $f_{\rm agn}$ by analyzing the spatial correlation between
GW source localizations ($O1\!-\!O4$a) and AGN distributions (SDSS DR16). We
find evidence of an excess of low-luminosity ($L_{\rm bol} \le
10^{45}~\!\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$) as well as low-Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm
Edd} \le 0.05$) AGNs around the LVK events, the explanation of which requires
$f_{\rm agn} = 0.39^{+0.41}_{-0.32}$ and $0.29^{+0.40}_{-0.25}$ (90\%
confidence level) of the LVK events originating from these respective AGN
populations. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that this correlation is unlikely
to arise from random coincidence, further supported by anomalous variation of
the error of $f_{\rm agn}$ with GW event counts. These results provide the
first observational evidence for GW sources coming from either low-luminosity
or low-accretion-rate AGNs, offering critical insights into the environmental
dependencies of the formation of GW sources.
