### [1] [Hybrid-chimes: A model for radiative cooling and the abundances of ions and molecules in simulations of galaxy formation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15773)

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 辐射过程在塑造从星际介质到星系际介质的多种天体物理环境中气体的热和化学状态中起着关键作用。现有研究在热平衡预测和化学网络处理方面存在不足。

Data: 研究使用了包括星际辐射场、宇宙射线速率和尘埃物理的参数化数据，以及chimes化学网络。

Method: 研究采用了一种混合冷却模型，结合了实时非平衡计算和准平衡冷却速率，以平衡计算效率和物理准确性。

Result: 研究发现热平衡预测低估了孤立星系模拟中的气体压力中值高达0.5 dex，且化学网络中不包含氧会使原子到分子氢的转变密度降低高达1 dex。

Abstract: Radiative processes play a pivotal role in shaping the thermal and chemical
states of gas across diverse astrophysical environments, from the interstellar
medium (ISM) to the intergalactic medium. We present a hybrid cooling model for
cosmological simulations that incorporates a comprehensive treatment of
radiative processes, including parameterizations of the interstellar radiation
field, cosmic ray rates, and dust physics. The model uses the chimes chemical
network and combines on-the-fly non-equilibrium calculations with
quasi-equilibrium cooling rates. The quasi-equilibrium rates account for the
time-dependent free electron fractions of elements tracked in non-equilibrium,
balancing computational efficiency with physical accuracy. We evaluate the
performance under various conditions, including the thermal evolution of
primordial gas at the cosmic mean density, the properties of the warm and cold
neutral media in Milky Way-like galaxies, and the atomic-to-molecular hydrogen
transition. We demonstrate that thermal equilibrium predictions for the neutral
phases of the ISM underestimate the median gas pressures in simulations of
isolated galaxies by up to 0.5 dex. Finally we find that the
atomic-to-molecular hydrogen transition is shifted to lower densities by up to
1 dex if oxygen is not included in the chemical network. Our work provides a
robust framework for studying the multi-phase ISM and its role in galaxy
formation and evolution.

### [2] [Novel $z\sim~10$ auroral line measurements extend the gradual offset of the FMR deep into the first Gyr of cosmic time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15779)
*Clara L. Pollock,Rashmi Gottumukkala,Kasper E. Heintz,Gabriel B. Brammer,Guido Roberts-Borsani,Pascal A. Oesch,Joris Witstok,Karla Z. Arellano-Córdova,Fergus Cullen,Dirk Scholte,Chamilla Terp,Lucie Rowland,Albert Sneppen,Kei Ito,Francesco Valentino,Jorryt Matthee,Darach Watson,Sune Toft*

**TL;DR**: 研究利用JWST/NIRSpec Prism观测数据，首次在z≈10的星系中直接测量了基于电子温度的金属丰度，揭示了高电离场和电子温度，并建立了M_UV与金属丰度的经验关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 宇宙黎明时期的第一批星系的质量组装和化学富集过程对理解其恒星形成历史和最早恒星族具有重要意义。现有研究在高红移星系的金属丰度测量方面存在局限性。

Data: 使用了JWST/NIRSpec Prism的高质量光谱观测数据，波长覆盖范围扩展至5.5微米。

Method: 通过改进的校准方法，检测了Hβ、[OIII]双线和[OIII]λ4363线，直接测量了基于电子温度的金属丰度。

Result: 研究发现z≈10的星系具有高电离场和电子温度，金属丰度范围为12+log(O/H)=7.1-8.3，并建立了M_UV与金属丰度的经验关系，揭示了金属丰度随红移逐渐降低的趋势。

Abstract: The mass assembly and chemical enrichment of the first galaxies provide key
insights into their star-formation histories and the earliest stellar
populations at cosmic dawn. Here we compile and utilize new, high-quality
spectroscopic JWST/NIRSpec Prism observations from the JWST archive. We extend
the wavelength coverage beyond the standard pipeline cutoff up to 5.5$\mu$m,
enabling a detailed examination of the rest-frame optical emission-line
properties for galaxies at $z\approx 10$. The improved calibration allows us to
detect H$\beta$ and the [OIII]$\lambda\lambda 4959,5007$ doublet and resolve
the auroral [OIII]$\lambda 4363$ line for the 11 galaxies in our sample
($z=9.3-10.0$) to obtain direct $T_e$-based metallicity measurements. We find
that all galaxies show high ionisation fields and electron temperatures, with
derived metallicities in the range $12+\log {\rm (O/H)} = 7.1 - 8.3$,
consistent with previous strong-line diagnostics at high-z. We derive an
empirical relation for $M_{\rm UV}$ and 12+log(O/H) at $z\approx 10$, useful
for future higher-z studies, and show that the sample galaxies are `typical'
star-forming galaxies though with relatively high specific star-formation rates
and with evidence for bursty star formation. Combining the rest-frame optical
line analysis and detailed UV to optical SED modelling, we determine the
mass-metallicity relation and the fundamental-metallicity relation of the
sample, pushing the redshift frontier of these measurements to $z=10$. These
results, together with literature measurements, point to a gradually decreasing
MZR at higher redshifts, with a break in the FMR at $z\approx 3$, decreasing to
metallicities $\approx 3\times$ lower at $z=10$ than observed during the
majority of cosmic time at $z=0-3$, likely caused by massive pristine gas
inflows diluting the observed metal abundances during early galaxy assembly at
cosmic dawn.

### [3] [Super-Eddington Growth Ceiling: Analytic Constraints on the Rapid Growth of Light-Seed Black Holes in Massive Clumps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15781)
*Masaki Kiyuna*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过分析黑洞-气体团捕获模型，发现超爱丁顿增长无法产生足够大的黑洞种子，支持重种子形成的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 在红移z大于8时，存在质量约为10的7到8次方太阳质量的超大质量黑洞，这对传统增长渠道提出了挑战。

Data: 研究使用了模拟数据，包括邦迪尺度流入、辐射反馈、气体动力学摩擦和电离气泡引起的前向加速效应。

Method: 通过解析论证和玩具模型模拟，重新审视了黑洞-气体团捕获模型。

Result: 研究发现，黑洞-气体团捕获模型无法产生质量超过10的4次方太阳质量的种子，支持重种子形成的必要性。

Abstract: The existence of $\sim10^{7-8}{\rm M}_\odot$ supermassive black holes at
$z\gtrsim 8$ challenges conventional growth channels. One attractive
possibility is that light seeds ($M_{\rm BH}\lesssim10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$)
undergo short, super-Eddington episodes when they cross, and are captured by,
dense massive gas clumps. We revisit this ``BH-clump-capture'' model using
analytic arguments supported by toy-model simulations that follow Bondi-scale
inflow, radiative feedback, gas dynamical friction and the recently discovered
forward acceleration effect caused by the ionised bubble. For substantial
growth the black hole must remain trapped for many dynamical times, which
imposes three simultaneous constraints. The clump must be heavier than the
black hole (mass doubling condition); its cooling time must exceed the
super-Eddington growth time (lifetime condition); and dynamical friction must
dominate shell acceleration (BH-trapping condition). These requirements confine
viable clumps to a narrow density-temperature region, $n_{\rm
H}\simeq10^{7-8}{\rm cm}^{-3}$ and $T\simeq(2-6)\times10^{3}{\rm K}$, for a
$10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$ seed. Even inside this sweet spot a $10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$
seed grow up at most $4\times10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$; the maximum growth ratio
$M_{\rm BH, fin}/M_{\rm BH}$ falls approximately as $M_{\rm BH}^{-0.4}$ and is
negligible once $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{4}{\rm M}_\odot$. The
forward-acceleration effect is essential, expelling the black hole whenever
photon trapping fails. We conclude that BH-clump-capture model, and potentially
broad super-Eddington models, cannot produce the $>10^{4}{\rm M}_\odot$ seeds
required for subsequent Eddington-limited growth, suggesting that alternative
pathways, such as heavy seed formation, remain necessary.

### [4] [How invisible stellar halos bias our understanding of ultra-faint galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15785)
*Coral Wheeler,Jorge Moreno,M. Katy Rodriguez Wimberly,Francisco J. Mercado,James S. Bullock,Michael Boylan-Kolchin,Pratik J. Gandhi,Sarah R. Loebman,Philip F. Hopkins*

**TL;DR**: 研究探讨了表面亮度检测极限对超暗弱星系性质推断的影响，发现考虑实际检测极限能更准确地匹配观测数据，但可能导致质量估计偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 超暗弱星系的表面亮度检测极限（μV ≈ 32.5 mag arcsec⁻²）可能影响对其性质的推断，但目前研究未充分探讨这一影响。

Data: 使用了19个恒星质量在400至40,000 M⊙之间的星系样本，基于FIRE-2物理模拟，重子质量分辨率为30 M⊙。

Method: 通过模拟分析表面亮度检测极限对星系尺寸、恒星质量、速度弥散等性质的影响，并与观测数据对比。

Result: 表面亮度检测极限导致星系尺寸、恒星质量和速度弥散值低于无极限时的推断值，但更接近观测数据；同时，质量估计偏差可能导致对暗物质密度和质量的过高估计。

Abstract: We explore how a realistic surface brightness detection limit of $\mu_V
\approx 32.5$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ for stars at the edges of ultra-faint galaxies
affects our ability to infer their underlying properties. We use a sample of 19
galaxies with stellar masses $\approx 400 - 40,000~{\rm M}_\odot$ simulated
with FIRE-2 physics and baryonic mass resolution of $30~M_{\odot}$. The surface
brightness cut leads to smaller sizes, lower stellar masses, and lower stellar
velocity dispersions than the values inferred without the cut. However, by
imposing this realistic limit, our inferred galaxy properties lie closer to
observed populations in the mass-size plane, better match observed velocity
dispersions as a function of stellar mass, and better reproduce derived
circular velocities as a function of half-light radius. For the most massive
galaxies in our sample, the surface brightness cut leads to higher mean $\rm
[Fe/H]$ values, but the increase is not enough to match the observed MZR.
Finally, we demonstrate that the common Wolf et al. (2010) mass estimator is
less accurate when the surface brightness cut is applied. For our lowest-mass
galaxies, in particular, excluding the low-surface brightness outskirts causes
us to overestimate their central dark-matter densities and virial masses. This
suggests that attempts to use mass estimates of ultra-faint galaxies to
constrain dark-matter physics or to place constraints on the low-mass threshold
of galaxy formation must take into account surface brightness limits or risk
significant biases.

### [5] [HI asymmetries in spatially resolved SIMBA galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15827)
*Nadine A. N. Hank,Marc A. W. Verheijen,Sarah-L. Blyth,Romeel Davé,Kyle A. Oman,Nathan Deg,Marcin Glowacki*

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过SIMBA宇宙学模拟分析了低红移星系的中性氢（HI）含量，发现其HI尺寸-质量关系与观测基本一致，但模拟星系在固定HI质量下略小，并探讨了HI不对称性与星系动态历史的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究背景包括利用SIMBA宇宙学模拟生成合成HI数据立方体，以匹配Apertif Medium-Deep HI成像观测，并探讨星系HI尺寸-质量关系及其不对称性。

Data: 研究使用了SIMBA宇宙学模拟生成的合成HI数据立方体，设计用于匹配Apertif Medium-Deeep HI成像观测数据。

Method: 研究方法包括生成合成HI数据立方体，分析HI尺寸-质量关系，并量化HI光谱和形态不对称性（A_flux和A_mod），同时根据星系动态历史分类。

Result: 研究发现SIMBA模拟的HI尺寸-质量关系与观测基本一致，但模拟星系略小；动态历史分类显示相互作用和合并星系的HI不对称性更高，且A_mod与重子质量呈负相关。

Abstract: We present a study of the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) content of spatially
resolved, low-redshift galaxies in the SIMBA cosmological simulations. We
create synthetic HI data cubes designed to match observations from the Apertif
Medium-Deep HI imaging survey, and follow an observational approach to derive
the HI size-mass relation. The HI size-mass relation for SIMBA is in broad
agreement with the observed relation to within 0.1 dex, but SIMBA galaxies are
slightly smaller than expected at fixed HI mass. We quantify the HI spectral
($A_{\mathrm{flux}}$) and morphological ($A_{\mathrm{mod}}$) asymmetries of the
galaxies and motivate standardizing the relative spatial resolution when
comparing values in a sample that spans several orders of magnitude in HI mass.
Galaxies are classified into three categories (isolated, interacted, or merged)
based on their dynamical histories over the preceding ~2 Gyr to contextualize
disturbances in their HI reservoirs. We determine that the interacted and
merged categories have higher mean asymmetries than the isolated category, with
a larger separation between the categories' $A_{\mathrm{mod}}$ distributions
than between their $A_{\mathrm{flux}}$ distributions. For the interacted and
merged categories, we find an inverse correlation between baryonic mass and
$A_{\mathrm{mod}}$ that is not observed between baryonic mass and
$A_{\mathrm{flux}}$. These results, coupled with the weak correlation found
between $A_{\mathrm{flux}}$ and $A_{\mathrm{mod}}$, highlight the limitations
of only using $A_{\mathrm{flux}}$ to infer the HI distributions of spatially
unresolved HI detections.

### [6] [Estimating Fe and Mg Abundances in the Milky Way Dwarf Galaxies Using Subaru/HSC and DEIMOS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15952)
*Jihye Hong,Evan N. Kirby,Tiffany M. Tang,Masashi Chiba,Yutaka Komiyama,Lauren E. Henderson,Itsuki Ogami,Timothy C. Beers*

**TL;DR**: 利用Subaru/HSC光度数据研究了Fornax、Sculptor、Ursa Minor和Draco矮星系的化学丰度分布，揭示了径向金属丰度梯度和不同星系的恒星形成历史。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 矮星系的化学丰度分布研究对理解其形成和演化至关重要，但早期研究因样本量和覆盖范围有限而未能检测到径向金属丰度梯度。

Data: 使用Subaru/HSC的光度数据，包括宽带g和i滤波器以及窄带NB515滤波器，结合Keck/DEIMOS的中分辨率（R ~ 6000）光谱数据。

Method: 采用随机森林回归器从6713个巨星候选样本中筛选数据，分析径向金属丰度梯度。

Result: 研究发现Fornax经历了延长的恒星形成，Sculptor在较短时间内形成了贫金属和富金属恒星，而Ursa Minor和Draco经历了短暂而强烈的恒星形成后几乎停止。HSC数据的扩展样本揭示了此前无法检测的化学梯度。

Abstract: We investigate the chemical abundance distributions of the Fornax, Sculptor,
Ursa Minor, and Draco dwarf galaxies using Subaru/HSC photometric data. The HSC
dataset, which includes broadband g and i filters and the narrowband NB515
filter, offers sensitivity to iron and magnesium abundances as well as surface
gravity, enabling the identification of giant stars and foreground dwarfs. For
analysis, we selected a total of 6713 giant candidates using a Random Forest
regressor trained on medium-resolution (R ~ 6000) Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic
data. Our analysis reveals the extent of radial metallicity gradients in the
galaxies. Such trends, not detectable in earlier studies, are now captured
owing to the substantially enlarged sample size and areal coverage provided by
the HSC data. These results are also consistent with chemical abundance
patterns previously observed in the central regions through spectroscopic
studies. Furthermore, we infer that Fornax underwent extended star formation,
whereas Sculptor formed both metal-poor and metal-rich stars over a shorter
time. Ursa Minor and Draco appear to have experienced brief, intense star
formation episodes leading to nearly extinguished star formation. This study
underscores the critical role of the expanded HSC dataset in revealing chemical
gradients that were previously inaccessible. Future work incorporating
additional spectra of metal-poor stars and age-sensitive isochrone modeling
will enable more accurate maps of chemical abundance distributions.

*Hiroma Okubo,Toshiki Saito,Shuro Takano,Nario Kuno,Akio Taniguchi,Taku Nakajima,Nanase Harada,Ken Mawatari*

**TL;DR**: 该研究利用主成分分析（PCA）对NGC 1068星系中心区域的13条分子线积分强度图进行分析，揭示了其结构和可能的AGN流出与星暴环的相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: NGC 1068是一个附近的II型塞弗特星系，其中心区域（半径约2 kpc）和星暴环区域（750 pc至2 kpc）具有复杂的结构。现有研究需要更客观的方法来可视化这些特征。

Data: 研究使用了阿塔卡马大型毫米/亚毫米阵列（ALMA）获取的NGC 1068星系13条分子线的积分强度图。

Method: 采用主成分分析（PCA）这一无监督机器学习技术，通过降维提取关键信息。

Result: PCA结果显示，整体区域可以重建近似H2柱密度的图，并区分环核盘（CND）与星暴环（SB ring）的体积密度和/或化学组成差异；星暴环区域的分析还揭示了AGN流出与星暴环气体的可能相互作用。

Abstract: We apply principal component analysis (PCA) to the integrated intensity maps
of 13 molecular lines of the nearby type-2 Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 obtained by
Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) to objectively visualize
the features of its center, (1) within a radius of about 2 kpc ($\sim$ 27".5;
hereafter the "overall region") and (2) the ring shaped starburst region
between 750 pc ($\sim$ 10") and 2 kpc ($\sim$ 27".5) of the galaxy (hereafter
the "SB ring region"). PCA is a powerful unsupervised machine learning
technique that extracts key information through dimensionality reduction. The
PCA results for the overall region have a possibility to reconstruct a map
representing the approximate H$_2$ column density and difference of volume
density and/or chemical composition between the circumnuclear disk (CND) and
the starburst ring (SB ring). Additionally, the PCA results for the SB ring
region have a possibility to reconstruct a map representing the approximate
H$_2$ column density and distinction between starburst dominated region and
shock dominated region. Furthermore, the PCA results for the SB ring region
indicate a possible interaction between the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)
outflow and gas in the SB ring. Although further investigation is required, we
suggest that the AGN outflow interacts with gas in the SB ring, as this feature
is consistent with the direction of the AGN outflow and is contributed by CN,
C$_2$H and HCN, which are known to be enhanced by the AGN outflow. These
results demonstrate that PCA can effectively extract features even for galaxies
with complex structures, such as AGN + SB ring. This study also implies that
PCA has the potential to uncover previously unrecognized phenomena by
visualizing latent structures in multi-line data.

### [8] [A Massive Yellow Supergiant in the Far Outer Disk of M31: Evidence for In Situ Massive Star Formation Beyond the Optical Radius](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16071)
*Pinjian Chen,Bingqiu Chen,Haibo Yuan,Xuan Fang,Xiaodian Chen,Chao-Wei Tsai,Kai Zhang,Xiaowei Liu*

**TL;DR**: 本文通过发现M31星系外围的一颗大质量黄超巨星LAMOST J0048+4154，挑战了大质量恒星形成仅限于星系内部高密度区域的传统观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 传统观点认为大质量恒星的形成需要星系内部高密度环境，但越来越多的证据表明星系外围也可能存在年轻的大质量恒星，然而在极低密度环境中直接确认大质量恒星形成的证据仍然稀少。

Data: 研究使用了LAMOST J0048+4154的光谱和测光数据，以及FAST H I观测数据。

Method: 通过光谱和测光分析对J0048+4154进行分类，并结合H I观测数据研究其空间和运动学特征。

Result: 研究发现J0048+4154是一颗F5-F8I超巨星，有效温度为6357+121-118 K，光度为log L/L⊙ = 5.00+0.06-0.06，对应约18 M⊙的前身星和约10 Myr的年龄，且其与H I外部臂的空间和运动学特征一致，支持其在低气体密度环境中的原位形成。

Abstract: While massive stars are known to shape galactic ecosystems, their formation
has long been assumed to require the high-density environments of inner
galactic disks. This paradigm is challenged by mounting evidence of young
massive stars in extended galaxy outskirts, yet direct confirmation of in situ
massive star formation in such extreme low-density environments remains scarce.
Here, we present the discovery of LAMOST J0048+4154, a massive yellow
supergiant situated at a deprojected galactocentric distance of ~34 kpc in M31,
making it the most distant massive star confirmed in this galaxy. Through
spectroscopic and photometric analyses, we classify J0048+4154 as an F5-F8I
supergiant with an effective temperature of $6357^{+121}_{-118}$ K and a
luminosity of $\log L/L_{\odot} = 5.00^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$, corresponding to an
~18 $M_{\odot}$ progenitor and an age of ~10 Myr. FAST H I observations reveal
close spatial and kinematic alignment between the star and a faint H I external
arm, suggesting in situ formation in a region of low gas density. The presence
of other UV-bright, early-type stars in the vicinity further supports low-level
recent star formation in M31's very outer disk. These findings challenge the
prevailing assumption that massive star formation is confined to inner disks or
classical star-forming regions and underscore the need to re-examine the role
of spiral galaxy outskirts in fueling and sustaining star formation. J0048+4154
thereby expands our understanding of the extent of M31's young stellar
component and exemplifies how outer disks may harbor conditions conducive to
forming massive stars, despite low-density environments.

**TL;DR**: 研究者开发了一种基于Swin Transformer架构的两阶段二元分类模型，用于从DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys中识别环状星系，并成功发现了8052个新的环状星系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系环结构的形成和演化对于理解暗物质性质、星系相互作用以及星系内部长期演化至关重要，但现有环状星系目录数量有限，限制了该领域的深入研究。

Data: 研究使用了DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR9的数据集，共处理了573,668张图像，红移范围从z_spec = 0.01到0.20，magr <17.5。

Method: 采用基于Swin Transformer架构的两阶段二元分类模型，首先筛选潜在候选星系，然后在第二阶段进行细化以提高分类准确性。

Result: 经过两阶段过滤和视觉检查，模型的总体精确度超过64.87%，成功识别出8052个新发现的环状星系。

Abstract: The formation and evolution of ring structures in galaxies are crucial for
understanding the nature and distribution of dark matter, galactic
interactions, and the internal secular evolution of galaxies. However, the
limited number of existing ring galaxy catalogs has constrained deeper
exploration in this field. To address this gap, we introduce a two-stage binary
classification model based on the Swin Transformer architecture to identify
ring galaxies from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys. This model first selects
potential candidates and then refines them in a second stage to improve
classification accuracy. During model training, we investigated the impact of
imbalanced datasets on the performance of the two-stage model. We experimented
with various model combinations applied to the datasets of the DESI Legacy
Imaging Surveys DR9, processing a total of 573,668 images with redshifts
ranging from z_spec = 0.01-0.20 and magr <17.5. After applying the two-stage
filtering and conducting visual inspections, the overall Precision of the
models exceeded 64.87%, successfully identifying a total of 8052 newly
discovered ring galaxies. With our catalog, the forthcoming spectroscopic data
from DESI will facilitate a more comprehensive investigation into the formation
and evolution of ring galaxies.

*Haoyang Liu,Cuihua Du,Mingji Deng,Jian Zhang*

**TL;DR**: 本研究利用卷积神经网络（CNN）从LAMOST和APOGEE巡天数据中估计了巨星的有效温度、表面重力、金属丰度及多种α元素丰度，并分析了其与已知子结构PG1和PG2的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 恒星参数和丰度对研究恒星和银河系演化至关重要，但目前需要更高效的方法来估计这些参数。

Data: 使用了LAMOST和APOGEE巡天中的1,100,858颗巨星数据，其中62,511颗共同恒星的光谱和标签作为训练集。

Method: 开发了一种卷积神经网络（CNN）来估计恒星参数和元素丰度。

Result: 测试集结果显示，对有效温度、金属丰度和表面重力的估计误差分别为50 K、0.13 dex和0.06 dex，α元素丰度的误差在0.03-0.05 dex之间，并成功分析了PG1和PG2子结构的起源。

Abstract: Stellar parameters and abundances provide crucial insights into stellar and
Galactic evolution studies. In this work, we developed a convolutional neural
network (CNN) to estimate stellar parameters: effective temperature
($T_{\text{eff}}$), surface gravity (log $g$) and metallicity (both [Fe/H] and
[M/H]) as well as six $\alpha$-elements (C, N, O, Mg, Si, Ca) and [$\alpha$/M].
We selected giant stars with \( 3500 \, \text{K} < T_{\text{eff}} < 5500 \,
\text{K} \) and \( 0 \, \text{dex} < \log g < 3.6 \, \text{dex} \) from the
LAMOST and APOGEE surveys, while requiring (S/N)$_g$ of the LAMOST
low-resolution spectra $>$ 10, which leaves 1,100,858 giant stars. The spectral
from LAMOST and the labels from APOGEE for 62,511 common stars were used as our
training set. The corresponding test set yields scatters 50 K, 0.06 dex and
0.13 dex for $T_{\text{eff}}$, [Fe/H] and log $g$, respectively. For $\alpha$
elements O, Mg, Si and Ca, the scatters are 0.05 dex, 0.04 dex, 0.03 and 0.04
dex, respectively. For C and N elements, the scatters are 0.07 dex and 0.05
dex. For [$\alpha$/M] and [M/H], the scatters are 0.03 dex and 0.06 dex. The
mean absolute error (MAE) of most elements are between 0.02 $-$ 0.04 dex. The
predicted abundances were cross-matched with previously identified
substructures PG1 and PG2, with their origins subsequently analyzed. Finally,
the catalog is available at https://nadc.china-vo.org/res/r101529/.

**TL;DR**: 通过潮汐瓦解事件（TDEs）研究低质量超大质量黑洞（SMBHs）及其宿主星系，扩展了SMBH-星系核球质量关系，发现斜率比现有文献更陡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 潮汐瓦解事件（TDEs）是探测低质量超大质量黑洞（SMBHs）的有效工具，这些黑洞可能无法通过其他方法被发现。目前的研究主要集中在高质量黑洞上，而低质量黑洞的SMBH-核球质量关系尚不明确。

Data: 使用了40个具有晚期UV/光学平台发射的TDE宿主星系的UV-MIR光谱能量分布数据，通过Prospector拟合得到核球质量。

Method: 通过TDE平台发射推导SMBH质量，并结合高质量SMBH样本扩展了SMBH-核球质量关系。使用前向建模分析选择效应对关系斜率的影响。

Result: 研究发现TDE平台发射是研究黑洞质量关系的有效方法。扩展后的关系斜率（m = 1.34 ± 0.03）比现有文献更陡。仅TDE样本的斜率较浅（m = 1.17 ± 0.10），但显著性高（<0.001）。前向建模表明低质量黑洞的斜率变化可由选择效应解释，但整体斜率变陡无法解释。

Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are excellent tools for probing low mass
supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that may otherwise remain undetected. Here, we
present an extended SMBH--Bulge mass scaling relationship using these lower
mass TDE black holes and their host galaxies. Bulge masses are derived using
Prospector fits to UV-MIR spectral energy distributions for the hosts of 40
TDEs that have a detected late-time UV/optical plateau emission, from which a
SMBH mass is derived. Overall, we find that TDE plateaus are a successful
method for probing BH scaling relations. We combine the observed TDE sample
with a higher mass SMBH sample and extend the known relationship, recovering a
steeper slope ($m = 1.34 \pm 0.03$) than current literature estimates, which
focus on the high mass regime. For the TDE only sample, we measure an equally
significant but shallower relationship with a power-law slope of $m = 1.17 \pm
0.10$ and significance $<0.001$. Forward modelling is used to determine whether
known selection effects can explain both the comparatively flatter TDE only
relation and the overall steepening across the full SMBH mass range. We find
that the flattening at TDE masses can be accounted for, however the steepening
can not. It appears that if a single slope extends for the whole BH mass range,
it must be steeper to include the TDE population.

**TL;DR**: 首次利用uGMRT的band-2（120-250 MHz）观测和Chandra X射线数据研究了双峰星系团Abell 1644，发现两个紧凑的射电源与X射线观测中的BCGs对应，未检测到非热弥散射电辐射，并揭示了该星系团的复杂动力学状态。

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Abell 1644是一个双峰星系团（z=0.0471），弱引力透镜测量揭示了其第三个子结构，但射电分析仅发现两个紧凑射电源与X射线观测中的BCGs对应。目前对非热弥散射电辐射（如晕或遗迹）的研究仍有限。

Data: 使用了uGMRT的band-2（120-250 MHz）射电观测数据和Chandra X射线数据。

Method: 通过射电分析和X射线分析，测量了射电源的流量密度并进行了频谱分析，同时计算了X射线观测中的激波马赫数。

Result: 发现两个紧凑的射电源（A1644N和A1644S），分别对应X射线观测中的BCGs，未检测到非热弥散射电辐射；X射线分析揭示了南部子结构中的两个激波前沿，表明存在正在进行的合并过程。

Abstract: We present the first band-2 (120 - 250 MHz) uGMRT (upgraded Giant Metrewave
Radio Telescope) observations of the bimodal galaxy cluster Abell 1644 (z =
0.0471), complemented by Chandra X-ray data. While weak lensing measurements
reveal a third substructure in Abell 1644, our radio analysis reveals only two
compact sources coinciding with the respective brightest cluster galaxies
(BCGs) of the northern (A1644N) and southern (A1644S) substructures, seen in
the X-ray observations. Radio analysis yields compact active galactic nuclei
(AGN) powered sources with radio power $P_{A1644S} = 1.1\times 10^{23} W/Hz$
and $P_{A1644N} = 7.3\times 10^{23} W/Hz$ at 200MHz. We find no evidence of
non-thermal diffuse radio emission, such as halos or relics, within the
sensitivity of our band-2 image. We measured the flux density of each radio
source and performed spectral analysis. A1644N exhibits a synchrotron power law
spectrum while A1644S shows spectral turnover suggestive of synchrotron
self-absorption. X-ray analysis reveals two shock fronts at the southern
substructure with a Mach number $M= 3.21 \pm 0.51$ and $M= 2.22 \pm 0.07$,
indicating an ongoing merger. Our findings reinforce the complex dynamical
nature of Abell 1644 and contribute to a deeper understanding of the cluster's
thermodynamic state. Future deep radio observations with improved radio
frequency interference (RFI) mitigation will be crucial for probing non-thermal
phenomena in this system.

<details>

Background: 观测天文学依赖视觉特征识别来检测关键天体物理现象，但机器学习模型在大规模巡天中因标记数据代表性不足而泛化能力受限，尤其是对稀有但科学价值高的天体。

Data: 使用了Galaxy Zoo 2数据集，该数据集包含志愿者标注的视觉特征与星系图像对。

Method: 提出了一种条件扩散模型，用于合成符合指定形态特征条件的高保真星系图像，并支持生成外推以将标注良好的数据投射到未见领域。

Result: 合成图像显著提升了机器学习模型的性能，在标准形态分类中关键指标上完整性和纯度提高了30%；在稀有天体检测中，检测实例数量从352增加到872。

Abstract: Observational astronomy relies on visual feature identification to detect
critical astrophysical phenomena. While machine learning (ML) increasingly
automates this process, models often struggle with generalization in
large-scale surveys due to the limited representativeness of labeled datasets
-- whether from simulations or human annotation -- a challenge pronounced for
rare yet scientifically valuable objects. To address this, we propose a
conditional diffusion model to synthesize realistic galaxy images for
augmenting ML training data. Leveraging the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset which contains
visual feature -- galaxy image pairs from volunteer annotation, we demonstrate
that our model generates diverse, high-fidelity galaxy images closely adhere to
the specified morphological feature conditions. Moreover, this model enables
generative extrapolation to project well-annotated data into unseen domains and
advancing rare object detection. Integrating synthesized images into ML
pipelines improves performance in standard morphology classification, boosting
completeness and purity by up to 30\% across key metrics. For rare object
detection, using early-type galaxies with prominent dust lane features (
$\sim$0.1\% in GZ2 dataset) as a test case, our approach doubled the number of
detected instances from 352 to 872, compared to previous studies based on
visual inspection. This study highlights the power of generative models to
bridge gaps between scarce labeled data and the vast, uncharted parameter space
of observational astronomy and sheds insight for future astrophysical
foundation model developments. Our project homepage is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究遥远星系的射电谱能量分布（SED）对于理解它们在宇宙时间尺度上的组装和演化至关重要。目前对高红移星系的射电SED研究仍存在不足。

Data: 使用了160个红移1.5到3.5的星暴星系样本，数据来自MeerKAT观测以及VLA和GMRT的存档数据。

Method: 采用贝叶斯方法建模射电SED，分离自由-自由辐射和同步辐射，并通过SED分析和红外-射电相关性（IRRC）校准恒星形成率。

Result: 发现同步辐射谱指数随红移和特定恒星形成率变平，磁场强度随红移和恒星形成率增加，且红外-射电相关性在红移1.5到3.5范围内保持不变。

Abstract: Studying the radio spectral energy distribution (SED) of distant galaxies is
essential for understanding their assembly and evolution over cosmic time. We
present rest-frame radio SEDs of a sample of 160 starburst galaxies at
redshifts 1.5 to 3.5 in the COSMOS field, as part of the MeerKAT International
GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) project. MeerKAT observations,
combined with archival VLA and GMRT data, allow us to determine the integrated
mid-radio (1-10 GHz) continuum (MRC) luminosity and magnetic field strength. A
Bayesian method is used to model the SEDs and separate free-free and
synchrotron emission. We calibrate the star formation rate (SFR) in radio both
directly through SED analysis and indirectly via the infrared-radio correlation
(IRRC). With a mean synchrotron spectral index of approximately 0.7, we find
that the index flattens with redshift and specific SFR, suggesting that cosmic
rays are more energetic in the early universe due to higher star formation
activity. The magnetic field strength increases with redshift (B is
proportional to (1 + z)^0.7) and with star formation rate (B is proportional to
SFR^0.3), indicating a small-scale dynamo as the dominant amplification
mechanism. Accounting for SED evolution, the IRRC remains redshift-invariant
and does not vary with stellar mass at 1.5 < z < 3.5, though the correlation
deviates from linearity. Similarly, we show that SFR estimates based on
integrated MRC luminosity are also redshift-invariant.

Background: 近年来，研究表明团内光（ICL）具有作为暗物质示踪物的潜力，且ICL与最亮团星系（BCG）和宿主星系团共同演化，是理解星系团动力学的有力工具。

Data: 研究使用了Illustris TNG300宇宙流体动力学模拟中的426个星系团数据（总质量M_tot>10^14 M_sun，红移z=0）。

Method: 采用加权重叠系数（WOC）方法，量化星系团不同组成部分在二维空间分布上的相似性。

Result: 研究发现，BCG+ICL和气体的空间分布与暗物质分布高度相似，且在更松弛的星系团中相似度更高，表明BCG+ICL可作为暗物质的有效示踪物，且其相似度反映了星系团的动力学状态。

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of intracluster light (ICL) as
a dark matter tracer. Moreover, the ICL co-evolves with the brightest cluster
galaxy (BCG) and the host cluster, making it a valuable tool for understanding
cluster dynamics. In this study, we utilize 426 galaxy clusters (with total
mass $M_{\rm tot}>10^{14} M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$) simulated in the cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation Illustris TNG300 to compare the spatial distributions
of dark matter, member galaxies, gas, and ICL and assess their effectiveness as
dark matter tracers in the central regions of clusters at $R_{\rm vir}<0.3$. We
apply the Weighted Overlap Coefficient (WOC), a methodology for quantifying the
similarity of two-dimensional spatial distributions, to various components of
the galaxy clusters at different dynamical stages. Our findings reveal that the
spatial distributions of both ICL combined with the BCG and gas closely
resemble the dark matter distribution, with higher fidelity observed in more
relaxed galaxy clusters with earlier half-mass epochs. These results
demonstrate that the BCG+ICL component serves as an effective tracer of dark
matter, consistent with previous observational studies linking cluster light to
mass. Moreover, the degree of spatial similarity between the BCG+ICL and dark
matter distributions appears to reflect the dynamical state of the cluster.

**TL;DR**: 通过分析Reticulum II超微弱矮星系中167颗恒星的低分辨率光谱，研究发现其金属丰度分布函数呈现双峰结构，支持了该星系在再电离后仍能形成恒星的两阶段恒星形成历史。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 超微弱矮星系（UFDs）中的恒星形成受到再电离的抑制，但可能并未完全停止。这些星系中恒星的金属丰度分布函数（MDF）可以反映再电离的特征，但过去的研究因样本量有限而受限。

Data: 使用Magellan/IMACS低分辨率光谱仪对Reticulum II超微弱矮星系中的167颗恒星进行了观测，首次测定了该星系中主序拐点恒星的光谱金属丰度。

Method: 通过低分辨率光谱分析，确定了恒星的金属丰度，并构建了金属丰度分布函数。

Result: Reticulum II的金属丰度分布函数呈现明显的双峰结构，80%的恒星位于金属贫乏峰（[Fe/H]=-3.0），20%位于金属较丰富峰（[Fe/H]=-2.1），表明该星系在再电离后仍能形成恒星，支持了两阶段恒星形成历史。

Abstract: Star formation in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs, $M_* <10^5M_\odot$) is
suppressed by reionization, but may not be completely quenched. The metallicity
distribution function (MDF) of stars in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies could show
these signatures of reionization. However, past studies of UFD MDFs have been
limited, because there are only a few dozen red giant branch (RGB) stars in
such low-mass galaxies. We present low-resolution Magellan/IMACS spectroscopy
of 167 stars in the UFD Reticulum II ($M_* \approx 3000 M_\odot$), increasing
the number of stellar metallicities by 6.5 times and resulting in the most
populated spectroscopic metallicity distribution function of any UFD. This is
possible because we determined the first spectroscopic metallicities of main
sequence turn-off stars in any UFD. The MDF of Reticulum II is clearly a
bimodal distribution, displaying two peaks with about $80\%$ of the stars in
the metal-poor peak at $\rm[Fe/H]=-3.0$ and $20\%$ of the stars in the more
metal-rich peak at $\rm[Fe/H]=-2.1$. Such a large metallicity gap can be
explained by Type Ia supernova enrichment during a long quiescent period. This
supports the currently-favored two-burst star formation history for Reticulum
II and shows that such low-mass galaxies clearly can form stars after
reionization.

**TL;DR**: 研究发现，在宇宙正午时期的低质量星系中，恒星形成主要由长时间尺度和大振幅的爆发周期主导，表明星系尺度气体循环是恒星形成变异性的主要调节机制。


<details>

Background: 尽管在本地星系群和模拟中观测到了低质量星系中的爆发性恒星形成，但由于观测限制，爆发周期的休眠阶段在本地宇宙之外尚未得到充分研究。

Data: 使用了41个JWST PRISM光谱的低质量星系样本（M_star < 10^9.5 M_sun），这些星系位于宇宙正午时期（1 < z < 3），并基于F200W星等和20波段JWST测光数据精确选择了红移。

Method: 通过将观测数据与基于简单参数化的爆发性恒星形成历史合成的光谱样本进行比较，分析了低质量星系的恒星形成特性。

Result: 研究发现，低质量星系在宇宙正午时期的恒星形成主要由长时间尺度（大于100 Myr）和大振幅（大于0.8 dex）的爆发周期主导，表明星系尺度气体循环是恒星形成变异性的主要调节机制。

Abstract: While bursty star formation in low-mass galaxies has been observed in local
populations and reproduced in simulations, the dormant phase of the burst cycle
has not been well studied beyond the local Universe due to observational
limitations. We present a unique sample of 41 JWST PRISM spectra of low-mass
galaxies ($M_\star < 10^{9.5}\,M_\odot$) at cosmic noon ($1<z<3$), uniformly
selected on F200W magnitude and precise photometric redshifts enabled by
20-band JWST photometry from the UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys. The spectra
reveal numerous strong Balmer breaks, which are negatively correlated with the
galaxies' H$\alpha$ equivalent width. By comparing these observations to
synthetic samples of spectra generated using a simple parametrization of bursty
star formation histories, we show that star formation in low-mass galaxies at
cosmic noon is likely dominated by burst cycles with long timescales ($\gtrsim
100$ Myr) and large deviations below the star-forming main sequence ($\gtrsim
0.8$ dex). Our results suggest that galaxies in this population--at least those
within our detection limits--should not be classified solely by their current
star formation rates, but instead viewed as a unified population undergoing
dynamic movement above and below the star-forming main sequence. The derived
constraints demonstrate that long-timescale fluctuations are important for this
class of galaxies, indicating that galaxy-scale gas cycles--rather than
molecular-cloud-scale stochasticity--are the primary regulators of star
formation variability in low-mass galaxies at cosmic noon.

Abstract: Gaia has revealed a variety of substructures in the phase space of stars in
the Solar neighborhood, including the vertical `Snail' in $(z,v_z)$ space. Such
substructures are often interpreted as the incompletely phase-mixed response of
the disc stars to a single perturbation, such as an impulsive encounter with a
satellite galaxy. In this paper we consider the possibility that such
structures contain manifestations of phase space echoes. First established in
plasma physics in the 1960s, echoes arise when a collisionless system is
perturbed twice: the macroscopic responses to both perturbations mix to small
scales in phase space, whereupon they couple nonlinearly, producing a third
macroscopic `echo' response without the need for a third perturbation. We
derive the galactic analogue of the plasma echo theory using angle-action
variables and apply it to a one-dimensional model of vertical motion in the
Milky Way. We verify the predicted echo behavior using idealized test particle
simulations, both with and without the inclusion of diffusion through orbital
scattering off molecular clouds. While we conclude that the Gaia Snail itself
is unlikely a (pure) echo effect, the basic physics we uncover is sufficiently
generic that we expect phase-space echoes to be common in disc galaxies.

Data: 使用全球MHD星系模拟数据，对比了有螺旋臂和无螺旋臂的同一星系的演化情况。

Method: 采用Ramses AMR代码进行模拟，其中一种情况包含自洽的恒星螺旋臂，另一种情况通过数值方法抑制螺旋臂。

Result: 螺旋臂使恒星形成率提高2.6倍，并驱动大尺度发电机机制，导致磁场在600 Myr的e-folding时间内增长，最终形成约1微高斯强度的磁场，且磁场与螺旋臂对齐并在10 kpc尺度上保持相干性。

Abstract: We use global MHD galaxy simulations to investigate the effects of spiral
arms on the evolution of magnetic fields and star formation within a
self-regulated interstellar medium (ISM). The same galaxy is simulated twice:
once with self-consistent stellar spiral arms and once more with the stellar
spirals suppressed via a novel numerical approach, using the Ramses AMR code.
Spiral arms continually promote star formation, with 2.6 times higher rates in
the spiral galaxy. The higher rate is due to high gas columns gathered along
the spiral arms, rather than increasing the star formation efficiency at a
given gas column. In both cases, the magnetic field is initially amplified via
a small-scale dynamo driven by turbulence due to supernova feedback. Only the
spiral galaxy exhibits late-time, consistent field growth due to a large-scale
dynamo (e-folding time $\sim600$ Myr). This results in volume-averaged field
strengths of $\sim 1$ $\mu$G after 1 Gyr of evolution. The mean-fields tend to
align themselves with the spiral arms and are coherent up to 10 kpc scales. We
demonstrate a novel large-scale dynamo mechanism, whereby spiral-driven radial
flows enable the mean-field amplification.

*Federica Fastidio,Elisa Bortolas,Alessia Gualandris,Alberto Sesana,Justin Read,Walter Dehnen*

**TL;DR**: The study investigates the dynamical evolution and merger timescales of supermassive black hole binaries (BHBs) using high-resolution simulations, finding high eccentricity in binaries entering the PTA band, which impacts the gravitational wave background (GWB) spectrum interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have detected evidence of a gravitational wave background (GWB) from unresolved supermassive black hole binaries (BHBs), with a spectrum flattening at lower frequencies suggesting eccentric BHBs. This study aims to understand the dynamical evolution and merger timescales of these massive BHBs, which are potential GWB sources.

Data: The study uses data from the IllustrisTNG100-1 cosmological simulation, re-simulated at high resolution with the N-body code Griffin, focusing on galactic major mergers down to binary separations of about a parsec.

Method: High-resolution N-body simulations with the Griffin code are employed, along with a semi-analytical model incorporating gravitational wave emission and stellar hardening to estimate coalescence timescales. The impact of prior mergers on remnant galaxies, such as core scouring and anisotropy, is also considered.

Result: The study finds that all binaries in the sample enter the PTA band with high eccentricity (e>0.85), affecting the GWB spectrum shape. Key findings include the duration of the dynamical friction phase, resolution independence of binary formation time, decreasing eccentricity scatter with higher resolution, and the formation of triple systems during interactions with a third galaxy.

Abstract: Results from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) show evidence of a gravitational
wave background (GWB) consistent with a population of unresolved supermassive
black hole binaries (BHBs). The observed spectrum shows a flattening at lower
frequencies that can be explained by a population of eccentric BHBs. This study
aims to determine the dynamical evolution and merger timescales of the most
massive BHBs, which are potential sources of the GWB. We select successive
galactic major mergers from the IllustrisTNG100-1 cosmological simulation and
re-simulate them at high resolution with the N-body code Griffin, down to
binary separations of the order of a parsec. Coalescence timescales are
estimated using a semi-analytical model that incorporates gravitational wave
emission and stellar hardening. Throughout our investigation, we consider the
impact of prior mergers on the remnant galaxy in the form of core scouring and
anisotropy, which can influence the subsequent formation and evolution of BHBs.
We find that all the binaries in our sample enter the PTA band with an
eccentricity e>0.85: such a large eccentricity can impact the shape of the PTA
observed GWB spectrum, and it highlights the importance of including the
eccentricity of binaries when interpreting the PTA signal. Furthermore, we find
that: (i) starting from initial separations of a few tens of kpcs, the
dynamical friction phase lasts for a few hundred Myrs; (ii) the binary
formation time is not resolution dependent; (iii) the scatter on the
eccentricity at binary formation decreases with increasing resolution; (iv)
triple systems form whenever a third galaxy interacts with a binary which
hasn't yet reached coalescence.

Abstract: Supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary systems are unavoidable outcomes of
galaxy mergers. Their dynamics encode information about their formation and
growth, the composition of their host galactic nuclei, the evolution of
galaxies, and the nature of gravity. Many SMBH binaries with separations pc-kpc
have been found, but closer (sub-parsec) binaries remain to be confirmed.
Identifying these systems may elucidate how binaries evolve past the ``final
parsec'' until gravitational radiation drives them to coalescence. Here we show
that SMBH binaries in non-active galactic nuclei can be identified and
characterized by the gravitational lensing of individual bright stars, located
behind them in the host galaxy. The rotation of `caustics' -- regions where
sources are hugely magnified due to the SMBH binary's orbit and inspiral --
leads to Quasi-Periodic Lensing of Starlight (QPLS). The extreme lensing
magnification of individual bright stars produces a significant variation in
the host galaxies' luminosity; their lightcurve traces the orbit of the SMBH
binary and its evolution. QPLS probes the population of sources observable by
pulsar timing arrays and space detectors (LISA, TianQin), offering advance
warning triggers for merging SMBHs for coincident or follow-up GW detections.
SMBH population models predict $1-50\; [190-5,000] \left({n_\star}/{\rm
pc}^{-3}\right)$ QPLS binaries with period less than $10\; [40]$ yr with
comparable masses and $z<0.3$, where $n_\star$ is the stellar number density.
Additionally, stellar and orbital motion will lead to frequent instances of
single/double flares caused by SMBHBs with longer periods. This novel signature
can be searched for in a wealth of existing and upcoming time-domain
photometric data: identifying quasi-periodic variability in galactic
lightcurves will reveal an ensemble of binary systems and illuminate
outstanding questions around them.

processes intersect, remains poorly characterized despite its critical role in
regulating galaxy evolution. We present results from Project AMIGA Insider,
mapping Andromeda's (M31) inner CGM within 0.25 R_vir (~75 kpc) using 11 QSO
sightlines, bringing our total sample to 54 sightlines from the disk to 2
R_vir. We detect a clear transition between M31's thick disk and CGM at R < 30
kpc, where low/intermediate ions show thick-disk corotating components with
higher column densities than the CGM ones, while high ions exhibit similar
column densities in both the CGM and thick disk. Beyond this region, all ion
column densities decrease with impact parameter, with steeper gradients for low
ions than high ions. The inner CGM (R < 100 kpc) shows more complex gas phases
and multi-component absorption compared to the predominantly single-component
outer CGM. We find no significant azimuthal dependence for any observed ions,
suggesting M31's CGM is shaped by radial processes (e.g., cooling flows,
precipitation) rather than disk-aligned outflows. We estimate the total metal
mass in M31's cool (SiII, SiIII, SiIV) CGM within R_vir to be
(1.9+/-0.3_stat+/-0.7_sys)x10^7 M_sun, leading to a cool gas mass of
approximately 6x10^9 (Z/0.3 Z_sun)^-1 M_sun. The warmer OVI gas may contain at
least 10 times more metal and gas mass. Compared to the COS-Halos L* galaxies,
M31's cool CGM shows lower Si column densities at R < 0.4 R_200 and lower cool
CGM masses, possibly resulting from M31's higher halo mass or different
environments.

**TL;DR**: 本文通过高分辨率光谱观测和模型分析，揭示了VV 114星系中星团驱动的星风对星系尺度反馈的显著贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: VV 114是一个局域红外明亮的合并星系，正在进行剧烈的星暴活动，并显示出星系尺度反馈的证据。现有研究需要更详细的光谱分析来揭示其反馈机制的具体来源和动力学特征。

Data: 使用了Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI)和MUSE IFU的高分辨率光谱数据，以及哈勃太空望远镜的窄带近红外成像和钱德拉X射线软波段图像。

Method: 通过光谱解混技术分析光学发射线，结合星团风模型和X射线光度估计机械能沉积率，验证了星团风对星系尺度反馈的驱动作用。

Result: 研究发现，星系中至少70%的激波光度由星团驱动，星团风的动力学功率与X射线光度估计的机械能沉积率一致，证实了星暴驱动的超级风的存在。

Abstract: We present high-resolution Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI) and MUSE IFU
spectroscopy of VV 114, a local infrared-luminous merger undergoing a vigorous
starburst and showing evidence of galactic-scale feedback. The high-resolution
data allow for spectral deblending of the optical emission lines and reveal a
broad emission line component ($\sigma_{\rm{broad}} \sim$~100--300 km s$^{-1}$)
with line ratios and kinematics consistent with a mixture of ionization by
stars and radiative shocks. The shock fraction (percent ionization due to
shocks) in the high velocity gas is anticorrelated with projected surface
number density of resolved star clusters, and we find radial density profiles
around clusters are well fit by models of adiabatically expanding cluster winds
driven by massive stellar winds and supernovae (SNe). The total kinetic power
estimated from the cluster wind models matches the wind+SNe mechanical energy
deposition rate estimated from the soft band X-ray luminosity, indicating that
at least 70\% of the shock luminosity in the galaxy is driven by the star
clusters. \emph{Hubble Space Telescope} narrow band near-infrared imaging
reveals embedded shocks in the dust-buried infrared nucleus of VV 114E. Most of
the shocked gas is blueshifted with respect to the quiescent medium, and there
is a close spatial correspondence between the shock map and the \emph{Chandra}
soft band X-ray image, implying the presence of a galactic superwind. The
energy budget of the superwind is in close agreement with the total kinetic
power of the cluster winds, confirming the superwind is driven by the
starburst.

### [24] [Coevolution of Intracluster Light and Brightest Cluster Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16645)
*Rebecca J. Mayes,Facundo A. Gómez,Antonela Monachesi*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过模拟分析星系团内光（ICL）和最亮团星系（BCG）的性质、起源及共同演化关系，发现两者虽有共同祖先星系但形成历史和性质不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系团内光（ICL）是星系团和星系群中与团势能相关的微弱恒星成分，占据团质量的显著部分，其形成和演化与最亮团星系（BCG）密切相关。

Data: 研究使用了流体动力学模拟Illustris-TNG100中的127个质量超过10^13太阳质量的星系团和星系群数据。

Method: 通过应用表面亮度切割（Holmberg半径26.5 mag/arcsec^2）区分ICL和BCG，并分析它们的性质及形成历史。

Result: ICL主要由剥离或合并的中等质量星系物质组成，而BCG由更高质量合并星系组成；ICL质量分数随团质量增加而微弱上升，随浓度下降，且与BCG最近大合并时间相关。ICL比BCG更蓝且金属贫乏，但年龄无显著差异。

Abstract: Context. Intracluster Light (ICL) is a faint stellar component of galaxy
groups and clusters bound to the cluster potential, and making up a significant
fraction of the cluster mass. ICL formation and evolution is strongly linked to
the Brightest Cluster Galaxies of clusters. Aims. To compare the properties and
progenitor galaxies of the Intracluster Light (ICL) and Brightest Cluster
Galaxies (BCGs) of clusters and groups at redshift z = 0, and determine how
they coevolve. Methods. We select 127 clusters and groups in the hydrodynamic
Illustris-TNG100 simulation above a mass of $10^{13} M_\odot$. We divide the
ICL from the BCG by applying a surface brightness cut at the Holmberg radius of
26.5 mag/arcsec$^{-2}$, where star particles within this radius are defined as
being attached to the BCG, and outside, the ICL. We then study the properties
and formation history of the ICL and BCG. Results. We find the ICL is generally
composed of material from stripped or merged intermediate mass galaxies, with a
smaller in-situ component, while the BCG is composed of more massive merged
galaxies and has a larger in-situ fraction. The ICL mass fraction increases
weakly with cluster mass, declines with concentration and increases with time
since the BCGs most recent major merger. The ICL is bluer and more metal-poor
than the BCG, but there is no significant difference in the age of the
material. Universally, BCG+ICL systems have negative colour and metallicity
gradients. The ICL and BCG share a high fraction of progenitor galaxies, but
the most significant progenitor is frequently not shared. Conclusions. ICL
properties and formation are tied to the formation histories of the host
cluster and BCG, and thus their properties are individual to each system.
Although the ICL and BCG coevolve, they have distinct formation histories and
properties.

Result: 研究发现HFs具有显著更高的密度对比、更大质量和更低维里比，表明分子云是由多尺度hub-filament结构引力耦合形成的网络结构，其中hub是局部引力中心和主要恒星形成位点。

Abstract: We decomposed the G333 complex and the G331 giant molecular cloud into
multi-scale hub-filament systems (HFs) using the high-resolution $^{13}$CO
(3$-$2) data from LAsMA observations. We employed the filfinder algorithm to
identify and characterize filaments within HFs. Compared with non-HFs, HFs have
significantly higher density contrast, larger masses and lower virial ratios.
Velocity gradient measurements around intensity peaks provide evidence of gas
inflow within these structures. There may be an evolutionary sequence from
non-HFs to HFs. Currently, non-HFs lack a distinct gravitational focusing
process that would result in significant density contrast. The density contrast
can effectively measure the extent of gravitational collapse and the strength
of the gravitational center of the structure that definitively shape the
hub-filament morphology. Combined with the kinematic evidence in our previous
studies, we suggest that molecular clouds are network structures formed by the
gravitational coupling of multi-scale hub-filament structures. The knots in the
networks are the hubs, they are the local gravitational centers and the main
star-forming sites. Actually, clumps in molecular clouds are equivalent to the
hubs. The network structure of molecular clouds can naturally explain that
feedback from protoclusters does not significantly change the kinematic
properties of the surrounding embedded dense gas structures, as concluded in
our previous studies.

*Timothy Faerber,Loren D. Anderson,Matteo Luisi,Lars Bonne,Nicola Schneider,Volker Ossenkopf-Okada,Alexander Tielens,Robert Simon,Markus Röllig*

**TL;DR**: 研究人员分析了35个HII区域的[CII] 158微米发射谱线，发现其中12个区域表现出明显的膨胀特征，平均膨胀速度约为12.2 km/s，揭示了HII区域反馈和演化的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: HII区域的膨胀特征及其驱动机制是理解恒星形成和星际介质反馈的重要课题。现有的研究表明，HII区域的膨胀可能与光致离解区（PDRs）的动力学行为有关，但具体机制仍需进一步研究。

Data: 使用了由平流层红外天文台（SOFIA）观测的35个HII区域的[CII] 158微米发射谱线数据。

Method: 通过分析[CII]发射谱线的亮度和窄线宽，测量了光致离解区（PDRs）的膨胀特征，并与球形膨胀模型进行了比较。

Result: 在35个HII区域中，12个（约34%）表现出明显的膨胀特征，平均膨胀速度为12.2 km/s。膨胀主要由热压力或恒星风驱动，但部分区域的驱动机制尚不明确。

Abstract: We analyze the expansion signatures of 35 HII regions mapped in [CII] 158
micron emission by the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy
(SOFIA). The [CII] emission primarily traces photodissociation regions (PDRs)
at the transition between ionized and neutral gas. The brightness and narrow
linewidth of [C II] allow us to measure PDR expansion. Bubble-shaped regions
often exhibit expansion, while irregular-shaped ones are less likely to. Of the
35 HII regions, 12 (~34%) exhibit clear expansion in position-velocity (PV)
diagrams, making them expansion candidates (ECs), with an average expansion
velocity of ~12.2 km/s. The remaining 23 regions show no clear expansion
signatures, though they may still be expanding below detection limits.
Blueshifted expansion is more common (eight ECs solely blueshifted; one
redshifted; three both), with mean velocities of ~10.9 km/s (blueshifted) and
~13.2 km/s (redshifted). A comparison of our observations to spherical
expansion models supports expansion in eight of 12 ECs. Estimated dynamical
ages are 10 to 100 times shorter than the ionizing star lifetimes, in agreement
with the results of previous studies. Of the 35 regions, 14 (~40%) appear as
[CII] bubbles; nine of the 12 ECs are bubble-shaped. Thermal pressure likely
drives expansion in M43, while stellar winds dominate in M17, M42, RCW 120, and
RCW 79. For other ECs, available data do not allow a definitive conclusion.
Larger samples and more information about ionizing sources are needed to refine
our understanding of HII region feedback and evolution.

Background: 研究基于先前提出的'分子云集合'概念，旨在解决稠密无旋分子云质量密度剖面演化的控制方程问题。

Data: 使用'集合抽象代表成员'模型，即球对称、各向同性和等温的分子云，假设其从周围径向吸积物质。

Method: 应用流体动力学方程于自引力等温球形气体云，得到两个未知场（密度剖面指数和吸积速度）的演化方程，并通过稳态流假设和主导项方法获得近似解。

Result: 远离云中心的密度剖面为ρ∝ℓ⁻²，吸积速度为常数；靠近中心为ρ∝ℓ⁻³/²，吸积速度vₐ∝ℓ⁻¹/²。外层稳定状态要求吸积流为亚音速，且密度标度指数p=2为吸引子，可能在稠密分子云中观测到。

Abstract: We aim to obtain the equations which govern the evolution of the mass density
profile of a dense irrotational molecular cloud (MC). Our study is based on the
notion of "ensemble of MCs", introduced in our previous work. The MCs are
modeled by use of the "ensemble abstract representative member": a spherically
symmetric, isotropic and isothermal MC which accretes radially matter from its
surroundings. Applying the equations of hydrodynamics to a self-gravitating
isothermal spherical gas cloud, we obtain a system of 2 first-order non-linear
partial differential equations, which govern the evolution of two unknown
fields: the exponent of density profile and the accretion velocity. Assuming a
steady-state flow, we get approximate solutions using the method of
leading-order terms. Far from the cloud centre the obtained density profile is
$\varrho=\ell^{-2}$ and the accretion velocity is constant, while near to the
centre $\varrho=\ell^{-3/2}$ and $v_{\rm a}\propto\ell^{-1/2}$. Through our
dynamical equations, the obtained solutions coincide completely with those
found using the equation of energy conservation of a fluid element (in our
previous work). Also, combining the equations of energy balance for a fluid
element, we arrive at the conclusion that the cloud layers far from the centre
are in a stable dynamical state if the accretion velocity flow is sub- or
transsonic; otherwise they are marginally stable (moderately supersonic flow)
or unstable (supersonic flow). Both solutions are consistent only if the
accretion flow is subsonic and hence the outer layers are stable. Finally,
under the assumption that both the accretion velocity and density scale with
$\ell$ and their power-law exponents are position-independent, we show that the
density scaling exponent far away from the centre is $p=2$ and this value is an
attractor. Hence this value should be observable in dense MCs.

Abstract: The hot circumgalactic medium (CGM), probed by X-ray observations, plays a
central role in understanding gas flows that drive a galaxy's evolution. While
CGM properties have been widely studied, the influence of a galaxy's
large-scale cosmic environment on the hot gas content remains less explored. We
investigate how the large-scale cosmic web affects the X-ray surface brightness
(XSB) profiles of galaxies in the context of cosmological simulations. We use
our novel IllustrisTNG-based lightcone, spanning $0.03 \leq z \leq 0.3$, first
developed in our previous work, and generate self-consistent mock X-ray
observations, using intrinsic gas cell information. We apply the filament
finder DisPerSE on the galaxy distributions to identify the cosmic filaments
within the lightcone. We classify central galaxies into five distinct
large-scale environment (LSE) categories: clusters and massive groups, cluster
outskirts, filaments, filament-void transition regions, and voids/walls. We
find that the X-ray surface brightness profiles (XSB) of central galaxies of
dark matter halos in filaments with $M_{\rm 200m} >10^{12}\ M_\odot$ are X-ray
brighter than those in voids and walls, with $20-45%$ deviations in the radial
range of $\sim (0.3-0.5) R_{\rm 200m}$. We investigate the source of this
enhancement and find that the filament galaxies show higher average gas
densities, temperatures, and metallicities compared to voids/walls galaxies.
Our results demonstrate that the impact of the large-scale cosmic environment
is imprinted on the hot CGM's X-ray emission. Future theoretical work on
studying the effect of assembly history, connectivity, and gas accretion on
galaxies in filaments and voids would help to further our understanding of the
impact of the environment on X-ray observations.

Background: 外银河系一氧化碳（CO）线发射在当前和未来的宇宙微波背景（CMB）小尺度调查中可能是一个重要信号，但目前对CO发射的理解存在很大不确定性。

Data: 使用了基于恒星形成率和光度关系生成的一系列CO模拟数据，以及宽带宇宙红外背景（CIB）数据。

Method: 通过生成跨宇宙时间的CO模拟数据，并量化其在90、150和220 GHz的CMB实验中的功率谱特征，同时评估CO对CMB前景的潜在偏差。

Result: 研究发现CO的自功率谱范围可达两个数量级，CO与CIB的交叉相关将成为未来CMB调查中的重要前景信号，且忽略CO可能导致CMB前景分析的显著偏差。

Abstract: Extragalactic carbon monoxide (CO) line emission will likely be an important
signal in current and future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) surveys on small
scales. However, great uncertainty surrounds our current understanding of CO
emission. We investigate the implications of this modeling uncertainty on CMB
surveys. Using a range of star formation rate and luminosity relations, we
generate a suite of CO simulations across cosmic time, together with the
broadband cosmic infrared background (CIB). From these, we quantify the power
spectrum signatures of CO that we would observe in a CMB experiment at 90, 150,
and 220 GHz. We find that the resulting range of CO auto-spectra spans up to
two orders of magnitude and that while CO on its own is unlikely to be
detectable in current CMB experiments, its cross-correlation with the CIB will
be a significant CMB foreground in future surveys. We then forecast the bias on
CMB foregrounds that would result if CO were neglected in a CMB power spectrum
analysis, finding shifts that can be comparable to some of the uncertainties on
CMB foreground constraints from recent surveys, particularly for the thermal
and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects and radio sources, and many times
greater than the expected uncertainties expected for future data. Finally, we
assess how the broad range of multifrequency CO$\times$CIB spectra we obtain is
captured by a reduced parameter set by performing a principal component
analysis, finding that three amplitude parameters suffice for a CMB-S4-like
survey. Our results demonstrate the importance for future CMB experiments to
account for a wide range of CO modeling, and that high-precision CMB
experiments may help constrain extragalactic CO models.

**TL;DR**: 研究通过参数化和非参数化方法测试了MACS 0416强透镜质量重建中未关联光线的质量团块（LUMCs），发现参数化模型无需引入LUMCs即可解释观测数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 在强透镜质量重建中，MACS 0416星系团被报告存在未关联光线的质量团块（LUMCs），这些团块在星系和星系团尺度上均被发现，对结构形成和演化的研究具有重要意义。

Data: 研究使用了303个多重图像数据。

Method: 研究采用了参数化方法（LENSTOOL）和非参数化方法（GRALE）进行质量建模。

Result: 研究发现参数化模型无需引入任何LUMCs即可解释观测数据，同时验证了星系尺度上的一个LUMC（M2）的存在，但其质量较低且对全局RMS改善有限。

Abstract: Light unaffiliated mass clumps (LUMCs), i.e. dark matter (DM) components
without any stellar counterparts, have been reported in strong lensing mass
reconstructions of MACS 0416, both on galaxy and galaxy cluster scales. On
galaxy cluster scale, the most recent parametric study based on 303 multiple
images features a LUMC, in the south of the cluster. On galaxy scale, the most
recent GRALE non-parametric study based on 237 multiple images features two
LUMCs, M1 and M2. Given the implications of these findings in the context of
structure formation and evolution, we test these features parametrically, using
LENSTOOL. First, we show that a mass model where each large scale DM component
introduced in the modelling is associated with a stellar counterpart can
reproduce the 303 multiple images, removing the need for any cluster scale LUMC
in \lens. We then update the GRALE model using the 303 multiple images, finding
that one of the two galaxy scale LUMC, M1, is no longer significant, while M2
remains. We test M2 by explicitely including it in our parametric model. We
find that the inclusion of this LUMC does not improve the global RMS, but
mildly improves locally the RMS for one multiple image located close to M2.
Besides, the preferred mass for M2 corresponds to the lowest mass allowed by
the adopted prior. M2 is therefore not strongly favoured by a parametric
approach but it is not ruled out. We present a comparison of parametric and
non-parametric models in the M2 area. Both approaches show very similar surface
mass density at this location, with a 5-6 % difference between the mass maps.
The difference is that GRALE favors a distinct mass substructure when LENSTOOL
favors a more diffuse mass distribution. We have been able to propose a
parametric mass model without including any LUMCs, providing further evidences
for DM being associated with light in clusters.

Background: 暗物质湮灭信号的形状研究是理解暗物质性质的重要途径，但目前纯暗物质模拟与包含恒星和气体的全流体动力学模拟结果存在差异。

Data: 使用FIRE-2宇宙学模拟数据，模拟银河系尺度暗物质晕的J因子发射信号。

Method: 采用最小二乘法拟合J因子发射信号的椭圆形状，分析半长轴与半短轴的比例及其角度取向。

Result: 发现J因子发射信号的形状比纯暗物质模拟更接近圆形（半短轴与半长轴比例约为0.8），且其长轴与银河系平面一致；全流体动力学模拟结果与Fermi-LAT观测的银河中心过剩信号一致。

Abstract: We use FIRE-2 zoom cosmological simulations of Milky Way size galaxy halos to
characterize the shape of the J-factor emission signal on the sky. We find
that, at a fixed dJ/d{\Omega} contour,the shape is well-fit by an ellipse, with
semi-major axis Rmajor and semi-minor axis Rminor measured in degrees on the
sky. We use least squares fitting to fit ellipses to the J-factor emission,
viewed from the solar location. The ratio of minor to major axes
(Rminor/Rmajor) allows us to characterize the shape of each contour, with ratio
1.0 corresponding to circular/spherical emission. These results provide new
expectations for the shape of dark matter annihilation emission signals we
might expect to see if dark matter is annihilating with its own anti-particle.
We find that both the shape and angular orientation of the emission signal is
different than results predict from dark matter only simulations. In terms of
shape, we find that the ratios of semi-minor to semi-major axis is always
consistently at 0.8, revealing a consistent circular emission shape, whereas
with dark matter only emission signals the range of ratios from halo to halo is
broader, and often closer to 0.5, showing a much more elliptical shape in
general. In terms of angular orientation, we find that the major axis of the
J-factor emission signal maps for FIRE halos are consistently aligned with the
galactic plane within a few degrees, meaning that excess emission out of the
plane would be hard to explain with a dark matter annihilation signal. However,
we also find that the expected emission signal would be consistent with
Fermi-LAT measurements showing a galactic center excess in full hydrodynamical
simulations with stars and gas included, while dark-matter-only simulations do
not produce the expected signal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 建模恒星形成星系对于未来通过星系红移巡天和线强度映射（LIM）观测大规模物质和星系分布至关重要。现有研究需要能够从暗物质模拟中生成真实星系群的工具。

Data: 研究使用了IllustrisTNG流体动力学模拟数据。

Method: 提出了CosmoGLINT，一种基于Transformer的自回归生成框架，能够根据暗物质晕的质量生成星系属性序列，包括恒星形成率、到晕中心的距离以及相对于晕的径向和切向速度。

Abstract: Modelling star-forming galaxies is crucial for upcoming observations of
large-scale matter and galaxy distributions with galaxy redshift surveys and
line intensity mapping (LIM). We introduce CosmoGLINT (Cosmological Generative
model for Line INtensity mapping with Transformer), a Transformer-based
generative framework designed to create realistic galaxy populations from dark
matter (DM)-only simulations. CosmoGLINT auto-regressively generates sequences
of galaxy properties -- including star formation rate (SFR), distance to the
halo centre, and radial and tangential velocities relative to the halo --
conditioned on halo mass. Trained on the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulation,
the model reproduces key statistical properties of the original data, including
the voxel intensity distribution and the power spectrum both in real and
redshift space. It can efficiently generate a number of different realisations
of the designated galaxy populations, enabling the creation of mock
LIM/redshift survey catalogues from large halo catalogues produced by fast
DM-only simulations. We show that our model trained at multiple redshifts can
be applied to DM halo lightcone data to generate a realistic mock galaxy
lightcone with incorporating the redshift evolution of the galaxy population.
The mock catalogues can be readily used to derive statistical quantities and to
develop data analysis pipelines for ongoing and future wide-field surveys.

**TL;DR**: 研究发现超暗矮星系（UFG's）与经典矮椭球星系（dSph）在宇宙学模拟中形成不同的星系类别，支持了弦理论中多轻玻色子（Axiverse）的预测，并提出了通过毫秒脉冲星观测验证的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 超暗矮星系（UFG's）与经典矮椭球星系（dSph）在质量和金属丰度上存在显著差异，这与标准暗物质模型中星系晕质量的连续性相矛盾。

Data: 研究使用了Leo K和Leo M等超暗矮星系的数据。

Method: 研究基于弦理论中多轻玻色子（Axiverse）的宇宙学模拟，并通过毫秒脉冲星的计时残差进行验证。

Result: 研究发现超暗矮星系对应于较重的玻色子（3×10^-21eV），而经典矮椭球星系对应于较轻的玻色子（10^-22eV），并预测了Leo M和Leo K的速度弥散差异。

Abstract: Recent discoveries of Ultra Faint dwarf galaxies (UFG's) infalling onto the
Milky Way, namely Leo K \& M at $r \simeq 450$kpc, considerably strengthens the
case that UFG's constitute a distinct galaxy class that is inherently smaller,
fainter and metal poor compared to the classical dwarf spheroidals (dSph). This
distinction is at odds with the inherent continuity of galaxy halo masses
formed under scale-free gravity for any standard dark matter model. Here we
show that distinct galaxy classes do evolve in cosmological simulations of
multiple light bosons representing the 'Axiverse' proposal of String Theory,
where a discrete mass spectrum of axions is generically predicted to span many
decades in mass. In this context, the
  observed UFG class we show corresponds to a relatively heavy boson of
$3\times 10^{-21}$eV, including Leo K \& M, whereas a lighter axion of
$10^{-22}$eV comprises the bulk of dark matter in all larger galaxies including
the dSph's. Although Leo M is larger in size than Leo K, we predict its
velocity dispersion to be smaller $\simeq 1.7$km/s, compared to $\simeq
4.5$km/s for Leo K, since soliton cores are required by the Uncertainty
Principle to be wider at lower momentum. This scenario can be definitively
tested using millisecond pulsars close to the Galactic center, where the
Compton frequencies of the heavy and light bosons imprint monotone timing
residuals that may be detected by SKA on timescales of approximately 1 week and
4 months, respectively.

*Rayna Rampalli,Melissa K. Ness,Elisabeth R. Newton,Andrew Vanderburg,Tobias Buck,Jessica Mills*

**TL;DR**: 研究探讨了宿主恒星金属丰度与巨行星之间的相关性如何影响热木星在银河系盘中的出生半径和相空间密度分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究表明，巨行星更倾向于在金属丰度较高的恒星周围形成，但这一趋势如何影响热木星在银河系不同区域的分布尚不清楚。

Data: 使用了GALAH和APOGEE巡天数据以及NIHAO模拟套件中的一个星系数据。

Method: 基于金属丰度的幂律分布注入热木星，分析了银河系化学演化对热木星分布的影响。

Result: 研究发现，热木星的出现率在出生半径大于5千秒差距时随半径增加而下降，且化学和运动学差异是相空间密度分布的主要驱动因素。

Abstract: We explore how the correlation between host star metallicity and giant
planets shapes hot Jupiter occurrence as a function of Galactic birth radius
(\rbirth) and phase-space density in the Milky Way disk. Using the GALAH and
APOGEE surveys and a galaxy from the NIHAO simulation suite, we inject hot
Jupiters around stars based on metallicity power laws, reflecting the trend
that giant planets preferentially form around metal-rich stars. For \rbirth\
$\geq 5$ kpc, hot Jupiter occurrence decreases with \rbirth\ by $\sim -0.1%$
per kpc; this is driven by the Galaxy's chemical evolution, where the inner
regions of the disk are more metal-rich. Differences in GALAH occurrence rates
versus APOGEE's and the simulation's at \rbirth\ $< 5$ kpc arise from survey
selection effects. APOGEE and the NIHAO simulation have more high-$\alpha$
sequence stars than GALAH, resulting in average differences in metallicity
(0.2--0.4 dex), $\alpha$-process element enrichment (0.2 dex), and vertical
velocities (7--14 km/s) at each \rbirth\ bin. Additionally, we replicate the
result of \cite{Winter20}, which showed that over 92% of hot Jupiters are
associated with stars in phase-space overdensities, or "clustered
environments." However, our findings suggest that this clustering effect is
primarily driven by chemical and kinematic differences between low and
high-$\alpha$ sequence star properties. Our results support stellar
characteristics, particularly metallicity, being the primary drivers of hot
Jupiter formation, which serves as the "null hypothesis" for interpreting
planet demographics. This underscores the need to disentangle planetary and
stellar properties from Galactic-scale effects in future planet demographics
studies.

**TL;DR**: 通过ALMA和VLA观测，研究IRAS 04169+2702原恒星系统的尘埃盘和分子线，揭示了毫米级或厘米级颗粒的存在、开普勒旋转盘以及大尺度螺旋结构。


<details>

Background: 研究背景包括对Taurus B213区域中IRAS 04169+2702原恒星系统的观测，旨在理解早期行星形成过程中尘埃盘和分子气体的动力学行为。

Data: 使用了ALMA的1.3毫米尘埃连续谱和分子线（12CO、13CO、C18O、SO、H2CO）数据，以及VLA的1.4厘米自由-自由辐射数据。

Method: 通过高分辨率（约0.05角秒）ALMA和VLA观测，分析尘埃连续谱和分子线的速度梯度及位置-速度图。

Result: 发现了一个半径约21 au的开普勒旋转盘，围绕1.3太阳质量的原恒星，以及延伸至1400 au的大尺度螺旋结构；尘埃谱指数约2.8，表明盘内存在毫米级或厘米级颗粒；C18O和SO的空间重合可能暗示螺旋臂中的激波与吸积相关。

Abstract: We present high-resolution ($\sim$0.05"; 8 au) dust continuum and molecular
line observations toward the Class I protostellar system IRAS 04169+2702 in the
Taurus B213 region, as part of the ALMA Large Program Early Planet Formation in
Embedded Disks (eDisk). The 1.3-mm dust continuum emission traces a
circumstellar disk with a central depression toward the protostar. Our VLA
observations of the same target reveal a single central peak dominated by the
free-free emission, which coincides with the depression of the thermal dust
emission. The mean spectral index of the thermal dust emission from 1.3 mm to
1.4 cm is approximately 2.8, suggestive of the presence of grains grown to
millimeter or centimeter sizes in the disk. Velocity gradients along the disk
major axis are seen in emission from $^{12}$CO (2-1), $^{13}$CO (2-1), and
C$^{18}$O (2-1) molecular lines. The position-velocity diagrams of these lines
unveil a Keplerian-rotating disk with a radius of $\sim$21 au around a 1.3
$M_{\odot}$ protostar, as well as an infalling and rotating envelope with the
angular momentum conserved. In addition to the compact disk, large-scale
infalling spiral structures extending up to approximately 1400 au, streamers,
are discovered in C$^{18}$O (2-1), SO (6$_5$-5$_4$), and H$_2$CO (3$_{0,
3}$-2$_{0, 2}$) as well as in the 1.3-mm continuum emission. Notably, in the
region closer to the protostar, the spatial coincidence of C$^{18}$O and SO may
indicate the presence of a shock related to accretion through the spiral arms.

### [37] [Measurements of the z=4-10 X-ray Luminosity Function: the high space density of moderate-luminosity, obscured AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16145)
*C. L. Barlow-Hall,J. Aird*

**TL;DR**: 研究发现高红移（z=4-10）中等光度AGN的空间密度高于模型预测，表明早期超大质量黑洞（SMBH）的增长比预期更普遍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 超大质量黑洞（SMBH）在早期宇宙中经历了显著增长，但X射线光度函数（XLF）作为SMBH吸积密度的主要示踪剂，在红移z>6时缺乏观测约束。

Data: 研究使用了UltraVISTA的深近红外成像数据和Chandra COSMOS的X射线数据，包括21个盲探测和11个直接提取的X射线源。

Method: 通过将深Chandra源列表与COSMOS2020星系位置进行交叉匹配，并直接提取X射线计数，构建了z=4-10的X射线AGN样本。

Result: 研究发现z=5-7的AGN空间密度比模型预测高约10倍，z=7-10时可能高达220倍；同时发现早期AGN中大部分被严重遮蔽，遮蔽比例高达0.982。这些结果填补了类星体光度函数与JWST观测的早期低光度AGN之间的空白。

Abstract: SMBHs are theorised to undergo significant growth in the early Universe,
however, the X-ray Luminosity Function (XLF), used as a principal tracer of the
SMBH accretion density, lacks observational constraints at z>6, until now. We
present new measurements of the z=4-10 XLF at intermediate luminosities, taking
advantage of recent deep near-IR imaging from UltraVISTA that enables us to
identify galaxies and AGN at high redshifts within which we identify X-ray
sources using Chandra COSMOS data. We first performed a cross-match to a deep
Chandra source list, for which the X-ray sensitivity can be accurately
quantified, before exploiting available X-ray data further through direct
extraction of X-ray counts at the positions of COSMOS2020 galaxies. With the
resulting z=4-10 X-ray AGN sample, comprised of 21 blind detections and 11
directly extracted detections, we have measured the early space density of AGN,
at moderate-luminosities where the majority of early SMBH growth occurred.
These measurements reveal higher space-densities than expected, based on the
extrapolation of XLF models from lower redshifts. Whilst our measured space
densities at z=4-5 are consistent with model predictions, at z=5-7 we find
space densities of the order of 10$\times$ the extrapolated model predictions
and could be as high as 220$\times$ the model extrapolations at z=7-10. In
addition, we find evidence that a large fraction of the early AGN population
are heavily obscured, with an obscured fraction of 0.982$^{+0.007}_{-0.008}$;
correcting for this obscuration further increases the measured space densities.
Comparing to recent JWST results, these measurements begin to bridge the gap
between the bright-end of the quasar luminosity function and the latest JWST
observations of very early, low-luminosity AGN, indicating a larger fraction of
the first galaxies play host to rapidly growing SMBH than previously thought.

*Isobel Romero-Shaw,Jakob Stegmann,Hiromichi Tagawa,Davide Gerosa,Johan Samsing,Nihar Gupte,Stephen R. Green*

**TL;DR**: GW200208_222617 is identified as the black-hole merger event with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity, suggesting a non-isolated formation channel likely from a field triple or globular cluster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Detecting orbital eccentricity in stellar-mass black-hole mergers indicates non-isolated formation channels, such as dense stellar environments or triple stellar systems. However, measuring eccentricity is challenging due to degeneracies with spin-induced precession.

Data: The study uses gravitational-wave data from the event GW200208_222617, which spanned approximately 14 orbital cycles and showed no data quality issues.

Method: The analysis involves comparing the gravitational-wave signal of GW200208_222617 with models of eccentric mergers from field triples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei.

Result: GW200208_222617 is the most unambiguous eccentric black-hole merger detected, with its origin consistent with a field triple or globular cluster, while formation in active galactic nuclei is less likely.

Abstract: Detecting orbital eccentricity in a stellar-mass black-hole merger would
point to a non-isolated formation channel. Eccentric binaries can form in dense
stellar environments such as globular clusters or active galactic nuclei, or
from triple stellar systems in the Galactic field. However, confidently
measuring eccentricity is challenging -- short signals from high-mass eccentric
mergers can mimic spin-induced precession, making the two effects hard to
disentangle. This degeneracy weakens considerably for longer-duration signals.
Here, GW200208_222617 provides a rare opportunity. Originating from a
relatively low-mass binary with source-frame chirp mass $\sim20$ M$_\odot$, its
gravitational-wave signal spanned $\sim14$ orbital cycles in band, with no
indication of data quality issues. Previous analyses for quasi-circular
binaries found no evidence for spin precession and, multiple subsequent studies
found the data to favour an eccentric merger despite notable technical
differences. All in all, we believe GW200208_222617 is the black-hole merger
event from GWTC-3 with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity. We
present a critical discussion of properties and astrophysical interpretation of
GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole merger using models of field
triples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei. We find that if
GW200208_222617 was indeed eccentric, its origin is consistent with a field
triple or globular cluster. Formation in the inner regions of an active
galactic nucleus is disfavoured. The outer regions of such a disk remain a
viable origin for GW200208_222617; we demonstrate how future detections of
eccentric mergers formed in such environments could be powerful tools for
constraining the disk geometry.

**TL;DR**: The study uses self-organizing maps (SOMs) to classify active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on variability features from light curves, showing promising results for future large-scale surveys like LSST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The classification of AGNs is challenging, and variability features from light curves offer a potential solution, especially for future surveys like the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).

Data: Variability features derived from light curves of AGNs.

Method: Self-organizing maps (SOMs) were applied to classify AGNs based on variability features, with a comparative analysis of different feature subsets.

Result: SOMs with variability features yield a relatively pure AGN sample, though completeness is challenging, especially for Type 2 AGNs, indicating potential for future large-scale surveys.

Abstract: Context. The classification of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is a challenge
in astrophysics. Variability features extracted from light curves offer a
promising avenue for distinguishing AGNs and their subclasses. This approach
would be very valuable in sight of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey
of Space and Time (LSST).
  Aims. Our goal is to utilize self-organizing maps (SOMs) to classify AGNs
based on variability features and investigate how the use of different subsets
of features impacts the purity and completeness of the resulting
classifications.
  Methods. We derived a set of variability features from light curves, similar
to those employed in previous studies, and applied SOMs to explore the
distribution of AGNs subclasses. We conducted a comparative analysis of the
classifications obtained with different subsets of features, focusing on the
ability to identify different AGNs types.
  Results. Our analysis demonstrates that using SOMs with variability features
yields a relatively pure AGNs sample, though completeness remains a challenge.
In particular, Type 2 AGNs are the hardest to identify, as can be expected.
These results represent a promising step toward the development of tools that
may support AGNs selection in future large-scale surveys such as LSST.

*Ernesto García Valencia,Laurent Loinard,Arnaud Belloche,Gisela N. Ortiz León,Sergio A. Dzib,Cherie K. Day,Roopesh Ojha*

**TL;DR**: 通过澳大利亚望远镜紧凑阵列（ATCA）对Chamaeleon恒星形成区进行的大规模射电观测，确定了五颗年轻恒星的存在，并初步探测到另外五颗，揭示了这些恒星的射电辐射机制及其可能的双星系统特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Chamaeleon恒星形成区是研究恒星形成和演化的重要区域，但对其年轻恒星的射电特性了解有限。现有研究在射电波段对其他区域的观测显示，多数探测到的源是较成熟的低质量T Tauri星，但对原恒星和Herbig Ae/Be星的射电特性研究较少。

Data: 使用了澳大利亚望远镜紧凑阵列（ATCA）和澳大利亚长基线阵列（LBA）的观测数据，并结合了Gaia DR3的数据进行对比分析。

Method: 通过ATCA进行大规模射电观测，随后对部分亮源进行LBA高分辨率观测，并结合Gaia DR3数据进行分析。

Result: 确定了五颗年轻恒星的存在，并初步探测到另外五颗；发现射电辐射机制主要为非热起源；通过LBA观测确认了其中一颗恒星（Ced 110 IRS2）的非热射电特性，并推测其为轨道周期约40年的双星系统。

Abstract: We report on large-scale radio observations of the Chamaeleon star-forming
region obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) that led to
the definite detection of five young stars and the tentative detection of five
more. As in other regions surveyed in the radio domain, the majority of
detected sources are fairly evolved low-mass T Tauri stars, but we also detect
one protostellar object (Ced 110 IRS4) and one Herbig Ae/Be star. With the
exception of the protostellar source, the radio emission mechanism is likely of
non-thermal origin. The three brightest radio stars identified with ATCA were
subsequently observed with the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA) and one,
J11061540-7721567 (Ced 110 IRS2), was detected at three epochs. This confirms
the non-thermal nature of the radio emission in that specific case, and enabled
accurate radio position measurements. Comparison with predictions from Gaia DR3
strongly suggests that this star is a binary system with an orbital period of
order 40 years; additional LBA observations in the next decades would enable
accurate determinations of the individual stellar masses in that system.

Background: 目前对三合星系统的研究缺乏大规模、高精度的数据支持，而Gaia数据为分析三合星系统的动力学特性和形成机制提供了新的机会。

Data: 使用Gaia数据构建的约10,000个太阳500 pc范围内的三合星系统目录。

Method: 通过分析三合星系统的动力学特性和统计分布，结合选择函数约束其内在人口统计学特征。

Result: 研究发现三合星系统具有分层的动力学稳定性，轨道倾角随系统紧凑程度变化，主星质量遵循Kroupa初始质量函数，内双星轨道特性与孤立双星相似，三合星比例随主星质量增加而上升（从5%到35%）。

Abstract: We present a catalog of $\sim 10,000$ resolved triple star systems within 500
pc of the Sun, constructed using Gaia data. The triples include main-sequence,
red giant, and white dwarf components spanning separations of 10 to 50,000 au.
A well-characterized selection function allows us to constrain intrinsic
demographics of the triple star population. We find that (a) all systems are
compatible with being hierarchical and dynamically stable; (b) mutual orbital
inclinations are isotropic for wide triples but show modest alignment as the
systems become more compact; (c) primary masses follow a Kroupa initial mass
function weighted by the triple fraction; (d) inner binary orbital periods,
eccentricities, and mass ratios mirror those of isolated binaries, including a
pronounced twin excess (mass ratios greater than 0.95) out to separations of
1000+ au, suggesting a common formation pathway; (e) tertiary mass ratios
follow a power-law distribution with slope -1.4; (f) tertiary orbits are
consistent with a log-normal period distribution and thermal eccentricities,
subject to dynamical stability. Informed by these observations, we develop a
publicly available prescription for generating mock triple star populations.
Finally, we estimate the catalog's completeness and infer the intrinsic triple
fraction, which rises steadily with primary mass: from $5\%$ at $\lesssim
0.5\,{\rm M_\odot}$ to $35\%$ at $2\,{\rm M_\odot}$. The public catalog
provides a robust testbed for models of triple star formation and evolution.

Abstract: Cepheus A HW2 is a well-studied massive young stellar object (MYSO) featuring
Class II methanol masers. Recently, certain maser components have been found to
flare every five years. This period went undetected in (NEO)WISE photometry due
to detector saturation. However, difference imaging revealed a light echo (LE),
representing a variability record. Its periodicity is similar to that of the
masers. Thereby, the mid-IR light curve since 2007 could be reconstructed.
Phase and period maps provide information on the circumstellar dust
distribution and viewing geometry. This is the first time an LE has been used
for reverberation mapping of a YSO environment and expanding its light curve

Abstract: The horizontal branch (HB) phase of stellar evolution plays a critical role
in understanding the life cycle of stars, particularly in the context of
low-mass stars. However, generating theoretical evolutionary tracks for HB
stars is computationally intensive, especially when attempting to match a wide
range of observational data. This work presents an extensive grid of HB
evolutionary tracks computed using the PGPUC code, covering a broad range of
chemical compositions, progenitor masses, and alpha-element distributions. The
aim is to provide a robust tool for interpreting HB stellar populations and
advancing our understanding of their diverse properties. The evolutionary
tracks are made publicly available through the PGPUC Online database for easy
access and interpolation. We computed over 19,000 HB evolutionary tracks
encompassing a wide range in terms of mass, metallicity, helium abundance, and
alpha-element enhancement, along with different progenitor masses. Using these
tracks, we calculated zero-age, middle-age, and terminal-age loci. The PGPUC
database now includes a fine grid of HB evolutionary tracks, allowing for
precise interpolation. Key findings include the dependence of HB morphology on
progenitor mass, metallicity, and helium abundance.

Background: 广义相对论（GR）自1915年提出以来经历了多次检验，弗里德曼在1920年代提出了首个现实的宇宙学模型，但由于意识形态原因在苏联长期被禁止研究。近年来，相对论和宇宙学领域取得重大进展，俄罗斯研究者在此领域贡献显著。

Data: 观测数据包括银河系中心最近的超大质量黑洞（Sgr A*）和M87*的超大质量黑洞。

Method: 通过回顾历史文献和总结观测与理论成果，分析广义相对论和物理宇宙学的发展。

Result: 总结了物理宇宙学过去100年的主要成就，包括黑洞阴影从纯理论概念到可观测量的演变，以及黑洞观测和理论验证的进展。

Abstract: General Relativity (GR) was created in November 1915 and since its creation
and up to now this theory has undergone many tests. The first realistic
cosmological models were proposed in the works of Friedman, written in the
1920s. For a long time Friedman's cosmological works were actually banned in
Soviet Union due to philosophical reasons, since the models where the birth and
evolution of the Universe occurs were considered ideologically unacceptable.
Due to great achievements in relativity and cosmology and due to increasing
interest to these branches of of science in last decades we recall a
development of relativistic astrophysics and contribution of Russian
researchers in these studies. Since one of the world leaders in physical
cosmology A. A. Friedman passed away in September 1925, it is reasonable to
outline the main achievements of physical cosmology over the past 100 years. We
discuss also observational and theoretical achievements in confirmations of
relativistic observational predictions for black holes, including the closest
supermassive black hole in our Galactic Center. We outline an evolution of
black hole shadow from the purely theoretical concept to observable quantities
for supermassive black holes in Sgr A* and M87*.
