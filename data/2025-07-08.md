### [1] [A Multi-Data Approach to Open Clusters: Roslund 3 and Ruprecht 174 in CCD UBV and Gaia DR3 Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03070)

**TL;DR**: 基于Gaia DR3数据结合UBV测光分析Roslund 3和Ruprecht 174两个疏散星团，确定了成员星、天体物理参数（距离、消光、金属丰度、年龄、质量函数斜率）及动力学状态，发现二者均为薄盘成员且达到动力学弛豫并存在质量分层现象。

Background: 研究银河系疏散星团Roslund 3和Ruprecht 174的结构、天体物理、运动学和动力学特性。

Data: 使用了CCD UBV测光数据以及Gaia DR3的天体测量和测光数据。

Method: 采用CCD UBV测光结合Gaia DR3天体测量与测光数据，并应用UPMASK算法计算成员概率，同时结合经典方法和MCMC技术确定天体物理参数。

Result: Roslund 3和Ruprecht 174的金属丰度接近太阳值，分别为[Fe/H] = 0.030±0.065 dex和[Fe/H] = 0.041±0.064 dex。

Abstract: A detailed analysis of the structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and
dynamical properties of the open clusters Roslund 3 and Ruprecht1 74 is carried
out using CCD UBV photometry in conjunction with astrometric and photometric
data from Gaia DR3. Membership probabilities were computed via the UPMASK
algorithm applied to Gaia proper motions and trigonometric parallaxes, leading
to the identification of 198 likely members for Roslund 3 and 397 for Ruprecht
174. Astrophysical parameters were derived using both the classical approach,
where parameters are independently determined, and a MCMC technique, which
estimates them simultaneously. The agreement between the results from both
methods confirms their reliability and highlights the robustness of the
classical method. The reddening values were determined as $E(B-V)=0.410\pm
0.046$ mag for Roslund 3 and $E(B-V)=0.615\pm 0.042$ mag for Ruprecht 174. The
estimated distances are $d=1687 \pm 121$ pc for Roslund 3 and $d=2385 \pm 163$
pc for Ruprecht 174. Both clusters exhibit metallicities close to the solar
value, with [Fe/H] = $0.030 \pm 0.065$ dex for Roslund 3 and [Fe/H] = $0.041
\pm 0.064$ dex for Ruprecht 174. The corresponding ages were found to be
$\tau=60\pm 6$ and $\tau=520\pm 50$ Myr, respectively. The present day mass
function slopes were found to be $1.18 \pm 0.13$ for Roslund 3 and $1.53 \pm
0.30$ for Ruprecht 174, consistent with the canonical Salpeter value within
uncertainties. Galactic orbital analyses indicate that both clusters are
thin-disk members confined within the Solar circle. Additionally, relaxation
times and spatial distributions of stars suggest that both clusters have
reached dynamical relaxation and exhibit clear signs of mass segregation.

### [2] [On the ages of the stellar populations of galaxies at $z=0.1$-7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03075)
*Eric E. Martínez-García*

**TL;DR**: 通过JWST和HST数据的光度分析发现，60%的星系年龄随红移演化符合ΛCDM宇宙学预期，而40%的异常老化星系可能由尘埃-年龄-金属丰度简并或活动星系核辐射导致。

Background: 探讨高红移星系年龄与宇宙年龄不一致的天文现象及其可能解释。

Data: 数据来源于JWST和HST的星系样本，通过测光分析进行研究。

Method: 通过测光分析结合恒星种群合成模型研究了星系年龄分布。

Result: 分析结果表明，60%的星系年龄随红移增加而减小，符合宇宙学预期，而剩余40%星系年龄异常可能源于红化-年龄-金属丰度简并或活动星系核影响。

Abstract: Recent studies have reported a non evolution of galaxy ages at redshifts
higher than $z\sim$ 2.5, as well as galaxies older than the Universe. In this
work, a sample of galaxies from JWST and HST was analysed via photometry to
further understand this astronomical phenomenon. No prior cosmological
parameters were assumed in the analysis, but the spectroscopic redshift. When
compared to stellar population synthesis models, the results for mass-weighted
galaxy ages indicate that the analysed objects seem to be divided into two
subsets. The results for the subset with the majority of objects (60\% assuming
a flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology) indicate an evolution of galaxy ages within the
redshift range $z$=0.1-7.0, in the sense that higher redshift galaxies are
younger than the Universe. Sources of systematic errors were discussed drawing
into conclusion that degeneracies between reddening-age-metallicity, and/or AGN
emission may explain the rest 40\% of the galaxies with ages older than
expected from a flat-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

**TL;DR**: 研究发现三个高红移原星系团中存在大量活动星系核（AGN），其AGN比例和密度显著高于场星系和低红移星系团，并排除了引力加热作为巨大莱曼α星云主要激发机制的可能性。

Background: 研究星系原星团中星系与活动星系核（AGN）的共演化及超大质量黑洞（SMBH）的增长机制。

Abstract: Protoclusters of galaxies are overdense regions of the Universe characterized
by large gas reservoirs. Such environments make them perfect laboratories to
investigate galaxy-AGN co-evolution and the growth of SMBHs. Galaxies living in
such a dense regions are expected to growth efficiently their SMBH, resulting
in a higher incidence of AGN than in the field. Some protoclusters exhibit
extended Ly$\alpha$ nebulae in their central region, pinpointing the presence
of massive gas reservoirs, but whose main powering mechanism is still debated.
We aim to investigate the AGN population, and AGN enhancement, in three
protoclusters at 2.3 < z < 3.2 which host enormous Ly$\alpha$ nebulae (ELANe).
Additionally, we search for the presence of X-ray diffuse emission in the same
region of the Ly$\alpha$ nebulae to reveal multi-phase gas in these
protoclusters. We use deep (190-270 ks) Chandra observations to identify AGN
among the protocluster members and perform X-ray spectral analysis to derive
the properties of those sources. We compare the AGN fraction and space density
with those observed in other known protoclusters and from the field
environment. We find 11 X-ray detected AGN in the three protoclusters. Each
structure hosts a central, X-ray powerful (log$(L_{\rm X}/{\rm erg \, s^{-1}})
\sim 45-46$), QSO, while the other X-ray sources are mostly moderately luminous
(log$(L_{\rm X}/{\rm erg \, s^{-1}}) \sim 44$) and obscured Compton-Thin AGN.
The fraction of AGN in our targets is comparable with estimates for other
protoclusters, and significantly higher than what is found for low-redshift
clusters. We also find a significant enhancement (2-4 dex) of AGN density with
respect to the field and to non active galaxies in the protoclusters. Finally,
we find no significant soft X-ray diffuse emissions from the nebulae, thus
ruling out gravitational heating as the main powering mechanism of the ELANe.

**TL;DR**: 通过JWST观测和微引力透镜模拟，发现Warhol弧中9颗红超巨星（T~4000K）的恒星金属丰度（log(Z*/Zsun)=-0.24）与星云氧丰度一致，且标准初始质量函数（alpha=2.35）能解释HST观测到的瞬变体探测率，但在JWST波段存在2σ内的高估。

Background: 研究恒星大气模型以分析高红移星系中强引力透镜放大下的红超巨星特性及其与恒星金属丰度和初始质量函数的关联。

Data: 使用JWST NIRCam对MACSJ0416星系团强透镜效应下的Warhol弧中九颗高度放大恒星进行测光观测，并结合Keck-I和大型双筒望远镜获取的新长缝光谱数据。

Result: 通过微透镜模拟发现，恒星金属丰度与观测到的温度分布和瞬变检测率密切相关，当恒星金属丰度等于星云金属丰度（log(Z*/Zsun)=-0.24）时，模拟结果与观测一致。

Abstract: We present stellar atmosphere modeling of JWST NIRCam photometry of nine
highly magnified individual stars in a single galaxy at redshift z=0.94 known
as the Warhol arc, which is strongly lensed by the galaxy cluster MACSJ0416.
Seven of these transients were identified by Yan et al. (2023). The nine
sources are all likely red supergiants with temperatures of T~4000K. We present
new longslit spectroscopy of the Warhol arc acquired with Keck-I and the Large
Binocular Telescope, and use these data to constrain the arc's oxygen abundance
to be 12+log(O/H)=8.45+-0.08. We perform a microlensing simulation on synthetic
stellar populations using a range of stellar metallicities and initial mass
function slopes. The temperature distribution of the simulated detectable stars
is sensitive to the choice of stellar metallicity, and setting the stellar
metallicity equal to the arc's nebular metallicity (log(Z*/Zsun)=-0.24)
produces a simulated temperature distribution that is consistent with the
observations, while lower stellar metallicities (log(Z*/Zsun)<-0.75) produce
simulated temperatures that are inconsistent with the observations. The
expected detection rate is strongly anticorrelated with the IMF slope for
{\alpha}>1.2. For the canonical IMF slope alpha=2.35, the simulation yields
expected transient detection rates that agree with the observed detection rates
in the HST Flashlights filters, but over predicts the detection rate by a
factor of ~3-12 (<2sigma tension) in the JWST filters. The simulated detection
rate is sensitive to the choice of stellar metallicity, with lower
metallicities (log(Z*/Zsun)<-0.75) yielding a significantly lower simulated
detection rate that further reduces the modest tension with the observations.

Background: 研究背景为利用微引力透镜效应探测宇宙学距离上的大质量恒星及其双星系统特性。

Data: 数据来源于JWST NIRCam对红移z=0.94的"Warhol arc"星系的成像观测，该星系被星系团MACS J0416.1-2403镜像成像。

Method: 利用微引力透镜效应分析双星系统（红超巨星和B型伴星）的光变曲线，结合运动学模型约束投影源平面尺寸和横向速度。

Result: 发现一个由红超巨星和B型伴星组成的双星系统通过微引力透镜效应被放大，其初始质量分别为22.5+7.1-5.5倍太阳质量和接近1的质量比。

Abstract: Massive stars at cosmological distances can be individually detected during
transient microlensing events, when gravitational lensing magnifications may
exceed mu ~ 1000. Nine such sources were identified in JWST NIRCam imaging of a
single galaxy at redshift z = 0.94 known as the "Warhol arc,'' which is
mirror-imaged by the galaxy cluster MACS J0416.1-2403. Here we present the
discovery of two coincident and well-characterized microlensing events at the
same location followed by a third event observed in a single filter
approximately 18 months later. The events can be explained by microlensing of a
binary star system consisting of a red supergiant (T ~ 4000 K) and a B-type (T
> 13,000 K) companion star. The timescale of the coincident microlensing events
constrains the projected source-plane size to R < 270 AU. The most likely
binary configurations consistent with the observational constraints on the
temperatures and luminosities of each star are stars with initial masses M1 =
22.5+7.1-5.5 Msun and an initial mass ratio very close to unity. A kinematic
model that reproduces the observed light curve in all filters gives a
relatively small transverse velocity of ~50 km/s. This requires the dominant
velocity component of several hundreds of km/s to be roughly parallel to the
microcaustic. An alternative possibility would be that the three microlensing
events correspond to unrelated stars crossing distinct microcaustics, but this
would imply a highly elevated rate of events at their common position, even
though no underlying knot is present at the location.

Abstract: We present a sample of 53 galaxy spectra at z_spec ~ 5-12 from the JWST CEERS
and RUBIES surveys, combining NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy with NIRCam
photometry. We aim to use these data to establish best practices for measuring
the UV spectral slope ($\beta$) in the era of JWST. We adopt power-law fits to
the rest-frame UV continuum from the spectroscopic data as our fiducial, or
`true', $\beta$ values, and compare them to photometric estimates derived
through three methods: (1) photometric power-law fitting, (2) power-law fitting
to an SED model fitted to the photometry, (3) single-color fitting near the
Lyman break, and (4) single-color fitting at fixed rest-frame wavelengths. We
find that photometric power-law fitting most closely recovers the spectroscopic
slopes, with minimal bias and scatter. SED fitting performs moderately well,
and can be preferable in cases of low signal-to-noise where photometric
power-law fitting may become unreliable. Single-color estimates, while commonly
used in past studies, show the most significant deviations and are not
recommended when more than a single color is available. Our results highlight
the limitations and strengths of each approach and provide practical guidance
for measuring $\beta$ from photometry when spectra are unavailable or are of
insufficient quality.

**TL;DR**: 利用JWST NIRCam多波段数据发现红移10-16星系样本，证实紫外光度函数在z>10时演化较平缓，并揭示了中波段滤光片对减少低红移污染和提高样本完整性的关键作用。

Background: 探索高红移（z∼10-16）星系的性质和演化，填补宇宙早期星系形成与演化的知识空白。

Data: 数据来源于JWST NIRCam在CANUCS（Cycle 1）和Technicolor（TEC）（Cycle 2）巡天中获取的22个中波段和宽波段深场成像数据，覆盖约23平方角分的三个独立天区。

Method: 基于多波段NIRCam成像数据，采用光度红移方法筛选高红移星系候选体。

Result: 利用CANUCS和TEC巡天的多波段NIRCam数据，在z∼10-16范围内发现8个候选星系，其中z∼15.4的候选星系可靠性极高。

Abstract: We present a sample of $z_{\rm phot}\sim10-16$ galaxies by exploiting one of
the richest JWST NIRCam imaging data, taken in the CANUCS survey in Cycle 1 and
the Technicolor (TEC) survey in Cycle 2. The combination of the CANUCS+TEC
provides multi-epoch, deep NIRCam images in all medium bands (MBs) and broad
bands (BBs) onboard NIRCam (22 filters in total), over $\sim23\ {\rm arcmin}^2$
in three independent lines of sight. We select high-$z$ galaxy candidates based
on photometric redshifts, and obtain eight candidates at $z\sim10-16$,
including a very robust candidate at $z\sim15.4$. The ultraviolet (UV)
luminosity function (LF) from our sample is consistent with previous JWST
studies showing a scatter of $\sim0.6$ dex across the literature, marking the
significance of the field-to-field variance in interpreting galaxy abundance
measurements at $z>10$. We find that the UV LF moderately evolves at $z>10$,
and the LF normalization and the luminosity density decline by a factor of
$\sim7$ from $z\sim11$ to $z\sim15$, indicating less steep evolution than
$z<11$. We highlight the importance of MB filters, not only to minimize the
contamination by low-$z$ interlopers but also to maximize the completeness. In
particular, faint and less blue galaxies could be missed when the sample is
built solely on BB data. The contamination and incompleteness of BB-only
selected samples can bias our views of earliest galaxy evolution at $z>10$,
including the UV LF by $\sim0.6$ dex, the size-magnitude relation by $\sim0.6$
dex, and the UV slope-magnitude relation by $\Delta\beta_{\rm UV}\sim-0.3$.

Abstract: Jellyfish galaxies provide direct evidence of ram pressure stripping in
cluster environments. We investigate the role of magnetic fields in the
formation of jellyfish galaxies with a multiphase interstellar medium (ISM)
using radiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulations. We impose magnetized (MHD)
and non-magnetized (HD) winds on the gas-rich dwarf galaxies containing the
magnetized or non-magnetized ISM. The MHD winds strip the disk gas more
effectively than the HD winds because of the magnetic force acting against the
local density gradient, which results in remarkably different ram pressure
stripped features. The magnetic fields induced by the MHD winds generate a
strong magnetic pressure, which forms smoothed disks and tail gas features.
Since the stripped ISM in MHD wind cases travels while being nearly isolated
from the intracluster medium (ICM), the stripped ISM mostly forms stars within
20~kpc of the galactic disks. In contrast, non-magnetized winds facilitate the
efficient mixing of the stripped ISM with the ICM, resulting in the formation
of abundant warm clouds that cool and collapse in the distant
($\sim50-100\,$kpc) tails at times of a few hundred Myr. Consequently, distant
tail star formation occurs only in the HD wind runs. Finally, despite the
different tail features, the star formation rates in the disk remain similar
owing to the interplay between the increased gas stripping and the gas density
increase in the disks of the MHD wind runs. These results suggest that the
magnetized ICM may have a significant influence on jellyfish galaxies, whereas
the magnetized ISM play a minor role.

Abstract: Investigating how small-scale physical processes shape large-scale
astrophysical phenomena is one of the key science themes of the Astro2020
decadal Survey. An example of this interplay is Cosmic Reionization, where
ionizing photons from galaxies escaped into the intergalactic medium (IGM),
driving its transition from neutral to ionized at $z>6$. Star-forming galaxies
are thought to be the dominant sources of reionization. However, an open
question remains as to whether bright or faint star-forming galaxies are the
primary reionization contributors. This depends on the escape fraction
$f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ -- the fraction of ionizing photons that successfully escape
the galaxy's interstellar and circumgalactic medium to reach the IGM.
Performing direct measurements of $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ during the reionization
epoch is not feasible, due to the near-zero transmission of the IGM at
$z\gtrsim4$. However, by calibrating $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ against indirect
indicators (i.e. galaxy properties that correlate with $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$) at
lower $z$, we can estimate its value in galaxies during reionization.
Currently, $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ calibrations are mostly limited to $\sim 90$
sources brighter $M_{UV} \sim -18$ at $z\sim0.3$. Yet, recent models suggest
that fainter galaxies ($-19<M_{UV}<-13$) may be the major contributors to
reionization. Our science goal is to extend $f_{~esc}^{LyC}$ calibrations to
such faint magnitudes. With the Habitable Worlds Observatory, we aim to achieve
a $\sim$ 20-fold increase in statistical power. Additionally, we plan to reach
magnitudes as faint as 1/100 $L^*$ at $z\sim0.1$. Suitable targets will be
selected from the upcoming Ultraviolet Explorer (UVEX) survey. Through this
science case, we will be able to place robust constraints on the role of faint
galaxies in the reionization of the Universe and identify its primary
contributors.

Result: 超暗弱矮星系恒星金属丰度主要由内部增丰与反馈驱动外流导致的金属损失之间的相互作用决定。

Abstract: We use intergalactic medium (IGM) metallicity distributions from several
state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of Milky Way analogs and a
semi-analytic model of ultra-faint dwarf galaxy (UFD) formation to model the
stellar metallicities of UFDs in MW-like environments. We study simulations
with different treatments of star formation, stellar feedback, and Population
III enrichment, and in all cases, we find that only a few percent of the IGM
accretable by UFD progenitors is enriched to metallicities $\rm [Fe/H]\ge-4$.
When the metallicity of accreted IGM in the semi-analytic galaxy formation
model is set using these IGM metallicity distributions, the model underpredicts
UFD metallicities and their scatter compared to the observed
luminosity--metallicity relation. Our results indicate that IGM enrichment is
not the dominant mechanism setting metallicities of UFD stars. Instead, UFD
stellar metallicity is determined primarily by the interplay between internal
enrichment and metal loss through feedback-driven outflows. We examine models
with different values of the maximum outflow mass loading factor $\eta_{\rm
max}$ and show that the full range of average stellar metallicities of UFDs at
$M_V<-7$ can be reproduced if the maximum mass loading factor varies in the
range $200\lesssim\eta_{\rm max}\lesssim 2000$. We also consider stellar
metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) within individual model galaxies with
different assumptions about IGM enrichment and $\eta_{\rm max}$. We find that
all considered models are in reasonable agreement with observed UFD MDFs, with
model differences less than the uncertainties of current metallicity
measurements.

Abstract: Multiphase filamentary nebulae are ubiquitous in the brightest cluster
galaxies (BCGs) of cool-core clusters, providing key insights into the cycle of
baryons and the feeding and feedback of supermassive black holes. However, BCGs
account for less than 1% of all early-type galaxies (ETGs). To broaden our
understanding of how multiphase filamentary nebulae form in ETGs and connect to
the greater picture of galaxy evolution, it is crucial to explore ETGs that are
outside of the dense centers of galaxy clusters or groups. We present VLT-MUSE
IFU observations of 126 nearby non-central ETGs, detecting warm ionized gas in
54 of them. 35 out of 54 display rotating disks that are morphologically and
kinematically aligned with their stellar components, suggesting stellar mass
loss as the origin of their warm gas. The remaining 19 host filamentary nebulae
that are decoupled from the stellar components, resembling those observed in
BCGs. These filamentary sources display unique emission line properties that
cannot be fully explained by photoionization from post-asymptotic giant branch
stars, active galactic nuclei, or fast gas shocks. For the eight filamentary
sources that have been observed with Chandra, their soft X-ray emission
indicates the presence of hot gas. We posit that their emission lines may be
powered by EUV and X-ray radiation from the cooling of the hot gas, similar to
cool-core clusters, but the detailed mechanisms and physical conditions may be
different. As a detailed study case, we investigate NGC 4374, a non-central ETG
with extensive Chandra observations, and find that its warm filaments are over
pressured compared to the hot filaments - opposite with what is observed in
cool-core clusters.

Background: 探讨激波物理和辐射转移处理在激波建模中的重要性及其对激波代码未来发展的影响。

Data: 使用了MAPPINGS和Cox/Raymond两个成熟激波代码中的模拟数据。

Method: 采用Rankine-Hugoniot流动方程描述激波流动，并比较两种代码对辐射传输的不同处理方法。

Result: 两种激波代码在激波前沿后物理性质相同，但对辐射转移的不同处理导致电离、热结构和发射线通量计算结果存在差异。

Abstract: In this paper, we summarize the shock physics and the treatment of radiative
transfer in two well-established shock codes -- the MAPPINGS code
(Dopita1976,Binette1985,Sutherland1993) and the Cox/Raymond code (hereafter CR
code) (Cox1972,Raymond1976,Raymond1979). We compare the ionization states,
temperatures, electron densities, and the energy transportation of the shock
models with shock velocities of 50, 110, 150 and 300 km/s. In summary, both
codes adopt the Rankine-Hugoniot flow equation to describe the shock flows,
giving the same shock physical properties at the immediate area behind shock
fronts. The different treatments of radiative transfer in these two codes leads
to somewhat different computation of the ionization and thermal structures of
shocks, as well as the emission-line fluxes. This work highlights the
importance of the delicate treatment of photoionization in shock models,
providing insight of the future development of shock codes, such as the 3D
shock codes.

Abstract: We analyze imaging from Data Preview 1 of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory to

coadd-\texttt{object} catalog demonstrates the depth and precision possible
with Rubin, recovering well-defined color magnitude diagrams for 47 Tuc Small
Magellanic Cloud. Unfortunately, the existing pipelines fail to recover sources
within $\sim$28 pc of the cluster center, due to the extreme source density.
Using Rubin's forced photometry on stars identified via Difference Imaging, we
can recover sources down to $\sim$14 pc from the cluster center, and find 14744
potential cluster members with this extended dataset. While this forced
photometry has significant systematics, our analysis showcases the potential
for detailed structural studies of crowded fields with the Rubin Observatory.

Background: 探讨高红移、被遮蔽的类星体“小红点”可能源于超强自相互作用暗物质驱动的早期黑洞种子形成机制。

Data: 数据来源于暗物质晕群演化的半解析模型、对数正态爱丁顿比分布的随机黑洞增长模拟，以及SIDM合并树模拟。

Method: 采用半解析模型追踪暗物质晕演化、坍缩红移及对应黑洞质量函数，并结合对数正态爱丁顿比分布和有限活跃周期随机模拟黑洞增长。

Result: 超强自相互作用暗物质（uSIDM）驱动的早期黑洞种子形成机制能自然解释“小红点”类星体的丰度、致密性及特征黑洞质量等观测特性。

Abstract: We investigate the possibility that the recently identified population of
high-redshift, obscured quasars - known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) -
originates from early black hole seed formation driven by ultra-strongly
self-interacting dark matter (uSIDM). In this framework, dark matter halos
undergo gravothermal core collapse due to large self-interaction cross
sections, resulting in the rapid formation of massive black hole (BH) seeds
with masses $\gtrsim 10^{5} M_\odot$ at redshifts $z \gtrsim 5$. We develop a
semi-analytic model that tracks the evolution of the dark matter halo
population, the redshift of collapse $z_{\rm coll}$, and the corresponding BH
mass function. Black hole growth is modeled stochastically via a log-normal
Eddington ratio distribution and a finite duty cycle. We find that the uSIDM
scenario naturally reproduces key observed properties of LRDs, including their
abundance, compactness, and characteristic BH masses, while offering a
mechanism for early, obscured black hole formation that is difficult to achieve
in standard CDM-based models. The predicted SMBH mass function at $z \sim 5$
shows excellent agreement with LRD observational data and SIDM merger-tree
simulations, particularly at the high-mass end $(m_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 10^{7}
M_\odot)$. These results suggest that LRDs may serve as powerful observational
tracers of exotic dark sector physics and that SMBH formation in the early
universe could be significantly shaped by non-gravitational dark matter
interactions.

Result: 结合GALEX紫外测光数据可显著提升类星体测光红移预测精度，减少散射和灾难性异常值。

Abstract: Accurate redshift measurements are essential for studying the evolution of
quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) and their role in cosmic structure formation.
While spectroscopic redshifts provide high precision, they are impractical for
the vast number of sources detected in large-scale surveys. Photometric
redshifts, derived from broadband fluxes, offer an efficient alternative,
particularly when combined with machine learning techniques. In this work, we
develop and evaluate a neural network model for predicting the redshifts of
QSOs in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Early Data Release
spectroscopic catalogue, using photometry from DESI, the Widefield Infrared
Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Galactic Evolution Explorer (GALEX). We compare
the performance of the neural network model against a k-Nearest Neighbours
approach, these being the most accurate and least resource-intensive of the
methods trialled herein, optimising model parameters and assessing accuracy
with standard statistical metrics. Our results show that incorporating
ultraviolet photometry from GALEX improves photometric redshift estimates,
reducing scatter and catastrophic outliers compared to models trained only on
near infrared and optical bands. The neural network achieves a correlation
coefficient with spectroscopic redshift of $0.9187$ with normalised median
absolute deviation of $0.197$, representing a significant improvement over
other methods. Our work combines DESI, WISE and GALEX measurements, providing
robust predictions which address the difficulties in predicting photometric
redshift of QSOs over a large redshift range.

Result: 发现吸积盘内区ADAF的冷却时标远小于观测到的CL AGNs转变时标，支持ADAF塌缩模型解释弱/无大尺度磁场的射电宁静CL AGNs现象。

Abstract: It is suggested that the variation of mass accretion rate in accretion disk
may be responsible for the occurrence of most changing-look active galactic
nuclei (CL AGNs). However, the viscous timescale of a thin disk is far longer
than the observed timescale of CL AGNs. Though this problem can be resolved by
introducing the large-scale magnetic field, the mechanism for radio-quiet CL
AGNs with weak/absent large-scale magnetic field remains a mystery. In this
work, we assume that the thin accretion disk is collapsed from the inner
advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) instead of substituting by the outer
thin disk through advection. This idea is tested by comparing the cooling
timescale ($t_{\rm cool}$) of an ADAF with the observed timescale ($t_{\rm
tran}$) of turn-on CL AGNs. We compile a sample of 102 turn-on CL AGNs from the
archived data and calculate the cooling timescale of an ADAF with the critical
mass accretion rate based on some conventional assumptions. It is found that
$t_{\rm cool}$ is much shorter than $t_{\rm tran}$ in most of the CL AGNs,
which validates our assumption though $t_{\rm cool}$ is not consistent with
$t_{\rm tran}$ ($t_{\rm cool}<t_{\rm tran}$). However, this is reasonable since
most of the CL AGNs were observed only two times, indicating that the observed
timescale $t_{\rm tran}$ is the maximum value because the changing-look can
indeed happen before the second observation.

Abstract: We present new JWST/NIRCam observations of the starburst irregular galaxy NGC
4449, obtained in Cycle 1 as part of the Feedback in Emerging extrAgalactic
Star clusTers (FEAST) program, which we use to investigate its resolved stellar
populations and their spatial distributions. NGC4449 NIR color-magnitude
diagrams reveal a broad range of stellar populations, spanning different
evolutionary phases, from young main sequence stars, to old red giant branch
stars and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The analysis of their spatial
distributions shows that younger (< 10 Myr) populations form an S-shaped
distribution aligned with the galaxy's north-south axis, while stars aged 10 -
60 Myr show shifting concentrations from the north to the south, consistent
with the possibility that external interactions or tidal effects may have
triggered star formation in spatially distinct bursts. Clusters of comparable
ages generally follow these distributions, suggesting that cluster and field
stars form at the same pace in each galaxy region. Thanks to the unprecedented
high-spatial resolution and sensitivity of the JWST data we recover a clear gap
between Oxygen-rich and the carbon star branch of the AGB population and the
presence of a massive AGB star "finger". The analysis of these stars can
provide constraints on AGB evolution models and dust production in this galaxy.
These results confirms NGC 4449 status as a compelling example of a local dwarf
starburst galaxy undergoing complex and possibly external driven star formation
and underscore the power of JWST in probing the full lifecycle of stars in
nearby starburst systems.

Abstract: The gravitational interaction between the Milky Way (MW) and the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) perturbs the MW halo's density and kinematics, encoding
information about both galaxies' masses and structures. We present a suite of
2,848 high-resolution ($10^7$ particles) N-body simulations that systematically
vary the mass and shape of both galaxies' haloes. We model how the mean
velocities and velocity dispersions of halo stars (30--120 kpc) depend on
system parameters, and forecast constraints achievable with current and future
observations. Assuming Gaia DR3-level astrometry, 20 km/s radial velocity
precision, 10% distance precision, and a sample of $\sim$4,000 RR Lyrae stars,
we achieve 1$\sigma$ uncertainties of $0.11 \times 10^{12} M_\odot$ in MW mass,
$2.33 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$ in LMC mass, 2.38 in halo concentration ($c$),
and 0.06 in halo flattening ($q$). These correspond to fractional uncertainties
of 11%, 16%, 25%, and 6% respectively, relative to fiducial values. Improved
Gaia proper motions (DR5) yield modest gains (up to 14%), while adding radial
velocities improves constraints by up to 60% relative to using Gaia astrometry
alone. Doubling the sample size to $\sim$8,000 stars yields an additional 30%
improvement, whereas reducing distance uncertainties has minimal impact
($\le$10%). Mean velocities trace LMC-induced perturbations, while velocity
dispersions constrain MW halo properties, jointly breaking degeneracies. Our
results demonstrate that combining Gaia astrometry with large spectroscopic
surveys will enable precise characterization of the MW-LMC system. This
methodology paper establishes the framework for interpreting observations;
future work will apply these tools to existing spectroscopic datasets. The full
simulation suite, HaloDance, will be made publicly available at:

Abstract: I present an analysis of archival spectra of 200 sources toward the Orion
Nebula Cluster (ONC) that were obtained with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph
(NIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). I have used these
data to assess cluster membership and measure spectral types for the targets.
Fifty-three sources are classified as likely cluster members, 24 of which have
spectral types that are suggestive of brown dwarfs ($>$M6). Seven of the
NIRSpec targets were previously identified as "Jupiter-mass binary objects"
(JuMBOs), all of which are background sources rather than brown dwarfs based on
the NIRSpec data. The spectral classifications of those objects are consistent
with the results of my recent study of the JWST photometry in the ONC, which
found that only a few JuMBO components have the colors expected for brown
dwarfs, none of which form pairs that have uniquely wide separations or low
masses relative to known binary brown dwarfs.

Result: 在11.5-9.0百万年前太阳系100帕秒范围内发生超新星事件的累积概率为68%，支持该时期深海铁锰壳中10Be异常可能源自超新星爆发。

Abstract: Recent measurements of cosmogenic $^{10}$Be in deep-ocean ferromanganese
crusts from the Central and Northern Pacific have revealed an anomalous
concentration between 11.5 and 9.0 Myr ago, peaking at 10.1 Myr. One possible
explanation is a nearby supernova (SN) event. Motivated by this and by the
proximity of the Solar System to the Orion star-forming region during that
period, we estimate the probability that at least one SN occurred between the
onset and peak of the anomaly. Using an open cluster catalog based on Gaia DR3,
we trace back the orbits of 2725 clusters and the Sun over the past 20 Myr and
compute the expected number of SN events. We find 19 clusters with a
probability greater than 1% each of producing at least one SN within 100 pc of
the Sun in the time interval 11.5-10.1 Myr ago. The total cumulative
probability exceeds zero at 35 pc from the Sun and increases rapidly with
distance, reaching 68% near 100 pc. Two young clusters dominate the SN
probability: ASCC 20 contributes most within 70 pc, while OCSN 61 becomes more
significant beyond that distance. Our results support the plausibility of a SN
origin for the $^{10}$Be anomaly and highlight the importance of additional
$^{10}$Be records from independent terrestrial archives to determine whether
the anomaly is of astrophysical or terrestrial origin.

Abstract: The gravitational potential of the Milky Way encodes information about the
distribution of all matter -- including dark matter -- throughout the Galaxy.
Gaia data release 3 has revealed a complex structure that necessitates flexible
models of the Galactic gravitational potential. We make use of a sample of 5.6
million upper-main-sequence stars to map the full 3D gravitational potential in
a one-kiloparsec radius from the Sun using a data-driven approach called ``Deep
Potential''. This method makes minimal assumptions about the dynamics of the
Galaxy -- that the stars are a collisionless system that is statistically
stationary in a rotating frame (with pattern speed to be determined). We model
the distribution of stars in 6D phase space using a normalizing flow and the
gravitational network using a neural network. We recover a local pattern speed
of $\Omega_p = 28.2\pm0.1\mathrm{\,km/s/kpc}$, a local total matter density of
$\rho=0.086\pm0.010\mathrm{\,M_\odot/pc^3}$ and local dark matter density of
$\rho_\mathrm{DM}=0.007\pm0.011\mathrm{\,M_\odot/pc^3}$. The full 3D model
exhibits spatial fluctuations, which may stem from the model architecture and
non-stationarity in the Milky Way.

Abstract: Understanding how the dynamical state of the interstellar medium (ISM)
changes across spatial scales can provide important insights into how the gas

ALMA $^{12}\mathrm{CO}(2-1)$ observations at $7$ pc ($0.4''$) spatial
resolution across a $1.4~\mathrm{kpc}\times5.6~\mathrm{kpc}$ ($1'.3\times1'.3$)
region located in the disk of the nearby ($D = 3.5$ Mpc), massive, star-forming
galaxy NGC 253. We decompose this emission with a hierarchical, multiscale
dendrogram algorithm to identify 2463 structures with deconvolved sizes ranging
from $\sim3$ to $300$ pc, complete to a limiting mass of
$10^4~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. By comparing the virial parameter of these structures
against physical properties including size, mass, surface density, velocity
dispersion, and hierarchical position, we carry out a comprehensive search for
a preferred scale at which gravitationally bound structures emerge. Ultimately,
we do not identify any emergent scale for bound objects in our data, nor do we
find a correlation between the virial parameter and structure sizes. These
findings suggest that gravitational binding cannot be used to define molecular
clouds and emphasize the need for multiscale approaches to characterize the
ISM.

Abstract: We present a science case for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) to map
the circumgalactic medium (CGM) in emission by targeting ultraviolet emission
lines, which trace the 10^4 - 10^6 K gas engaged in the feedback and accretion
mechanisms driving galaxy evolution. While the CGM-galaxy connection is clearly
evident through absorption line experiments and limited work done in optical
and radio emission from the ground, the nature of this connection is poorly
understood with regard to how these cosmic ecosystems exchange matter and
energy. We outline a two-pronged experiment with Habitable Worlds Observatory
(HWO) utilizing both multi-object spectroscopy to map kpc-scale CGM structures
such as galactic superwinds and integral field spectroscopy to unveil the
sub-kpc-scale processes such as thermal instabilities, which are theorized to
govern the cool gas reservoirs long detected in pencil-beam absorption surveys.
This article is an adaptation of a science case document developed by HWO's

Background: 探讨潮汐力在分子云形成中的作用及其对云团引力状态的调控影响。

Data: 使用AREPO的Voronoi网格代码对银河系质量星系进行模拟，从中心、近太阳圈和外围三个不同区域选取数据，每个区域在三个不同时间点（间隔2 Myr）进行分析。

Abstract: We investigate the role of tidal forces in molecular cloud formation by
examining how apparent boundedness, as diagnosed by the classical virial
parameter, relates to the actual gravitational state of clouds subject to tidal
forces from their environment. Clouds are identified by a dendrogram algorithm
in zoom-in regions taken from a simulation of a Milky Way-mass galaxy with the
Voronoi mesh code AREPO that resolves star-forming regions at sub-parsec
resolution. To look at a range of environments, we use data from three
different regions that evolve differently in the center, near the equivalent of
the Solar circle, and the outskirts of the modeled galaxy, at three different
times, each spaced 2 Myr apart. We compute the importance of tidal forces on
all identified clouds. We then compare the boundedness of clouds including only
their internal potentials to boundedness also including the external
gravitational potential. This comparison shows that tidal forces can unbind
apparently bound clouds and bind apparently unbound clouds. We characterize the
cloud population by comparing their virial parameters to their surface
densities, finding the ratio of the maximum to the minimum eigenvalues of the
tidal tensor, and determining the strength of gravitational instability in each
examined region. We find that it is necessary to take the total gravitational
potential into account rather than just the internal self-gravity of the clouds
to have an accurate understanding of cloud dynamics.

Abstract: A proper modelling of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate within gas clouds is
crucial to describe their chemical evolution accurately. However, this
modelling is computationally demanding because it requires the propagation of
cosmic rays throughout the cloud over time. We present a more efficient
approach that simultaneously guarantees a reliable estimate of the cosmic-ray
impact on the chemistry of prestellar cores. We introduce a numerical framework
that mimics the cosmic-ray propagation within gas clouds and applies it to
magnetohydrodynamic simulations performed with the code GIZMO. It simulates the
cosmic-ray attenuation by computing the effective column density of H$_2$ that
is traversed, which is estimated using the same kernel weighting approach as
employed in the simulation. The obtained cosmic-ray ionisation rate is then
used in post-processing to study the chemical evolution of the clouds. We found
that cosmic-ray propagation affects deuterated and non-deuterated species
significantly and that it depends on the assumed cosmic-ray spectrum. We
explored correlations between the electron abundance, the cosmic-ray ionisation
rate, and the abundance of the most relevant ions (HCO$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$,
DCO$^+$, N$_2$D$^+$, and o-H$_2$D$^+$), with the purpose of finding simple
expressions that link them. We provide an analytical formula to estimate the
ionisation fraction, X(e$^-$), from observable tracers and applied it to
existing observations of high-mass clumps. We obtained values of about
10$^{-8}$, which is in line with previous works and with expectations for dense
clouds. We also provide a linear fit to calculate the cosmic-ray ionisation
rate from the local H$_2$ density, which is to be employed in three-dimensional
simulations that do not include cosmic-ray propagation.

Method: 采用宽线区厚盘模型分析f因子变化与观测参数的相关性。

Result: 发现f因子与宽线宽度、爱丁顿比和线轮廓形状显著相关，且f的变化可通过BLR几何或倾角变化解释。

Abstract: The variability of virial factor $f$ is investigated for two active galactic
nucleus, NGC 5548 and NGC 4151, which had been previously reverberation mapped
(RM) over 20 times in the past 30 years. Using four velocity tracers from the
broad H$\beta$ width at half-maximum ($\rm FWHM_{\rm H\beta} $) or the line
dispersion from the mean or rms spectra, $f$ for each RM epoch are calculated.
Significant correlations are found between $f$ and observational parameters,
such as the broad line widths, the Eddington ratios and the line profile
shapes. For NGC 5548, $f \propto \rm {FWHM}_{mean}^{-0.70\pm0.13}$ and for NGC
4151, $f \propto \rm {FWHM}_{mean}^{-3.31\pm0.59}$. This suggests that a
variable $f$ should be included to weight the virial SMBH mass. Using a simple
model of thick-disc broad line regions (BLRs), we show that changes in mean
inclination can explain $f$ variation. The inclination range is $14.1-40.6$ deg
for NGC 5548 and $14.0-55.1$ deg for NGC 4151. Modeling the light curves of $f$
with a damped random walk process yields mean timescales of 638 and 668 days,
consistent with BLR dynamical timescales within uncertainties. This indicates
that $f$ variations are linked to BLR dynamics, likely due to changes in
geometry or inclination.

Background: 探索JWST发现的致密红星系（LRDs）在宇宙时间尺度上的演化及其对星系形成理论的挑战。

Data: 数据来源于CEERS（宇宙演化早期释放科学）巡天的观测数据。

Method: 采用单Sérsic轮廓拟合形态参数，并通过仅含恒星的SED拟合获取物理性质。

Result: 发现"后LRD"候选星系具有LRD类似特征但带有扩展外围结构，其数量密度与高红移LRD匹配，支持LRD通过冷吸积逐渐形成扩展恒星成分的演化场景。

Abstract: One of JWST's most remarkable discoveries is a population of compact red
galaxies known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Their existence raises many questions
about their nature, origin, and evolution. These galaxies show a steep decline
in number density-nearly two orders of magnitude-from $z=6$ to $z=3$. In this
study, we explore their potential evolution by identifying candidate
descendants in CEERS, assuming a single evolutionary path: the development of a
blue star-forming outskirt around the red compact core. Our color-magnitude
selection identifies galaxies as red as LRDs at $z<4$, surrounded by young,
blue stellar outskirts. Morphological parameters were derived from single
S\'ersic profile fits; physical properties were obtained from SED fitting using
a stellar-only model. These "post-LRD" candidates show LRD-like features with
$M_\ast \sim 10^{10} \ M_\odot $, central densities ($ \Sigma_\ast \sim 10^{11}
\ M_\odot \ \text{kpc}^{-2}$ ), compact sizes, and red rest-frame colors, but
with an added extended component. Their number density at $z = 3 \pm 0.5$ ( $
\sim 10^{-4.15} \, \text{Mpc}^{-3} $) matches that of LRDs at $5 < z < 7$ ,
supporting a possible evolutionary link. We observe a redshift-dependent
increase in outskirts mass fraction and galaxy size-from $\sim 250$ pc at $ z =
5 $ to $\sim 600$ pc at $ z = 3 $-suggesting global stellar growth. Meanwhile,
the core remains red and compact, but the V-shape fades as the outskirts grow.
These findings support an evolutionary scenario in which LRDs gradually acquire
an extended stellar component over cosmic time by cold accretion. This may
explain the apparent decline in their observed number density at lower
redshift.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the galaxy size-stellar mass relation
(SMR) at low redshift (z <= 0.125), using a large spectroscopic sample from the
SDSS-DR13 survey. Our goal is to investigate how environment affects galaxy
structural properties across multiple spatial scales. Galaxies are classified
by specific star formation rate, optical color, and bulge-to-total light ratio,
allowing us to disentangle environmental effects from intrinsic galaxy
properties. We examine the SMR in three contexts: (1) comparing galaxy sizes in
two extreme environments-dense clusters versus cosmic voids; (2) analyzing
cluster galaxies across a range of cluster masses; and (3) studying member
galaxies located in different cluster regions, from the core to the infall
zone. In all three cases, we find no significant dependence of the SMR on
environment at fixed stellar mass and galaxy type. Cluster and void galaxies
follow consistent SMR trends, and no measurable variation is observed with
cluster mass or cluster-centric distance. We also confirm that early-type
galaxies exhibit steeper SMR slopes than late types. Notably, this consistent
lack of environmental dependence on the SMR persists even when accounting for
the differing galaxy number densities in voids, supporting the universality of
this SMR scaling relation across diverse environments.

Abstract: In this manuscript, we propose, for the first time, an oversimplified but
potentially effective gravitational acceleration model to interpret the
double-peaked narrow emission lines (DPNELs) shifted in the same direction. We
adopt the framework of a merging kpc-scale dual-core system in an elliptical
orbit, which has an emission-line galaxy with clear narrow line regions (NLRs)
merging with a companion galaxy lacking emission line features. Due to
gravitational forces induced by both galaxies on the NLRs, the accelerations of
the far-side and near-side NLR components may share the same vector direction
when projected along the line-of-sight, leading the velocities of the observed
DPNELs to shift in the same direction. Our simulations indicate that the
probability of producing double-peaked features shifted in the same direction
reaches 5.81% in merging kpc-scale dual core systems containing emission-line
galaxies. Besides the expected results from our proposed model, we identify a
unique galaxy SDSS J001050.52-103246.6, whose apparent DPNELs shifted in the
same direction can be plausibly explained by the gravitational acceleration
model. This proposed model provides a new path to explain DPNELs shifted in the
same direction in the scenario that the two galaxies align along the
line-of-sight in kpc-scale dual-core systems.

Result: 活动星系核的光学连续谱带间延迟表现出显著的季节性变化和随机性，且短期延迟普遍小于长期延迟。

Abstract: Interband lags in the optical continua of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have
been observed over years of monitoring, yet their physical origins remain
unclear. While variable interband lags have been found in a few individual AGN
potentially, the temporal behavior of interband lags of an AGN sample has not
been explored systematically. Here, we analyze the interband lags of 94 bright
AGN at $z<0.8$, using both seasonal one-year and full six-year $gri$-band light
curves from Zwicky Transient Facility Data Release 22. We find that more than
half of 94 AGN show significant seasonal variations in the interband lags.
Besides, the short-term lags, derived by averaging lags inferred from multiple
seasonal light curves, are consistently smaller than the long-term lags, which
are inferred from the full six-year light curves. This supports recent
theoretical simulations where the lag measurement is sensitive to the baseline
of light curve and the lag variation could be simply attributed to the inherent
randomness of AGN variability. Our findings suggest that the interband lags of
AGN are more complex and stochastic than commonly thought, and highlight the
importance of high-precision time-domain surveys in uncovering the properties
of AGN variability as well as the associated accretion physics.

Result: 在银河系和其他棒旋星系中发现的扩展速度特征（EVFs）源于棒结构驱动的高度非圆周流中相对速度超过100km/s的极端云-云碰撞。

Abstract: The inner regions of the Milky Way are known to contain an enigmatic
population of prominent molecular clouds characterised by extremely broad
lines. The physical origin of these ''extended velocity features'' (EVFs) is
still debated, although a connection with the ''dust lanes'' of the Galactic
bar has been hypothesised. In this paper, we search for analogous features in
the dust lanes of nearby barred galaxies using the PHANGS-ALMA CO(2-1) survey.
We aim to confirm existence of EVFs in other galaxies and to take advantage of
the external perspective to gain insight into their origin. We study a sample
of 29 barred galaxies and find that 34% contain one or more EVFs, while the
remaining lack obvious signs of EVFs. Upon analysing the physical properties of
the EVFs, we find they possess large virial parameters, ranging from few
hundreds to several thousand, indicating that they are strongly
out-of-equilibrium. The most likely explanation for their origin is extreme
cloud-cloud collisions with relative velocities in excess of 100km/s in highly
non-circular flow driven by the bar. This interpretation is consistent with
previous high-resolution observations in Milky Way. Further corroboration of
this interpretation comes from the inspection of high-sensitivity infrared
observations from the PHANGS-JWST Treasury Survey that reveals streams of gas
that appear to be hitting the dust lanes at locations where EVFs are found. We
argue that EVFs are the clearest examples of cloud-cloud collisions available
in literature and represent a unique opportunity to study cloud collisions and
their impact on star formation.

Abstract: We present the results of a deep neutral hydrogen (Hi) observation of the
early-type galaxy NGC 2768 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical
radio Telescope (FAST). Leveraging the high sensitivity of FAST, we discover an
extended gas envelope around NGC 2768. The total Hi mass is measured to be 8.1
x 10^8 M_sun , representing a magnitude increase compared to previous
Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) studies. Position-velocity (PV)
diagram indicates the envelope mainly involves two components: an Hi disk of
NGC 2768 and a newly discovered satellite galaxy without detectable
counterparts in currently deep optical surveys. The center of the gas disk is
mis-aligned with the optical disk of NGC 2768, with more gas redshifted,
indicating it has been disturbed. Our study indicates NGC 2768 is currently
undergoing a transition from a spiral galaxy to an S0. Previous deep WSRT
observations reveal two dense clumps (named as Clumps A and Clump B throughout
this paper) in the center of the envelope. We find Clump A corresponds to the
densest part of the disk, while Clump B might be a newly discovered satellite
galaxy which probably collided NGC 2768 about 0.38 Gyr ago. We also find tidal
interactions between Clump B and PGC 2599651, NGC 2768 and UGC 4808. Based on
these new findings, we finally analyze hierarchical accretion history of NGC
2768.

Result: 仅在LMC中发现一颗具有显著红外超的恒星，而在SMC、M31和M33中未发现，表明MW造父变星的红外超可能比麦哲伦云更显著。

Abstract: The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 20 Milky Way (MW), 9 Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC), 7 Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), 12 M31, and 7 M33
(classical) Cepheids with periods longer than 50 days were constructed using
photometric data from the literature and fitted with model atmospheres with the
aim of identifying objects with an infrared excess.
  The SEDs were fitted with stellar photosphere models to derive the
best-fitting luminosity and effective temperature; a dust component was added
when required. The distance and reddening values were taken from the
literature.
  WISE and IRAC images were inspected to verify whether potential excess
emission was related to the central objects.
  Only one star with a significant infrared (IR) excess was found in the LMC
and none in the SMC, M31, and M33, contrary to earlier work on the MW
suggesting that IR excess may be more prominent in MW Cepheids than in the
Magellanic Clouds. One additional object in the MW was found to have an IR
excess, but it is unclear whether it is a classical Cepheid or a type-{\sc ii}
Cepheid.
  The stars were plotted in a Hertzsprung--Russell diagram (HRD) and compared
to evolutionary tracks for CCs and to theoretical instability strips. For the
large majority of stars, the position in the HRD is consistent with the
instability strip.
  For stars in the MW uncertainties in the distance and reddening can
significantly change their position in the HRD.

Result: 质子跳跃反应模型比完全混合模型更符合观测结果，氨及其氘代形式的自旋比通常等于统计值。

Abstract: We determined the ortho/para (o/p) ratios of NH2D and NHD2 in the
archetypical pre-stellar core L1544. The core was observed in the two lowest
rotational lines of ortho- and para-NH2D using the APEX and the IRAM 30 m
telescopes. The ground-state lines of ortho- and para-NHD2 were observed with
APEX. The distributions of chemical abundances in the core were predicted using
a gas-grain chemistry model with two different scenarios concerning proton
transfer reactions in the gas. One of the scenarios, the so-called full
scrambling (FS), allows protons and deuterons to be completely mixed in the
intermediate reaction complex before dissociation, whereas the other describes
these reactions as proton or deuteron hops (PH). We also tested assumed
abundance profiles independent of the chemistry models. Radiative transfer
calculations were used to simulate the observed NH2D and NHD2 lines from the
predicted and assumed abundance profiles. Our modelling efforts suggest that
the ground-state lines of NH2D and NHD2 at the wavelength 0.9 mm that are
observable with the same beam and in the same spectrometer band are the most
reliable probes of the o/p ratios. Simulations using the PH reaction scheme
show systematically better agreement with the observations than simulations
with the FS model. Simulations using a broken power law abundance profile as a
function of the gas density give spin ratios that are close to the predictions
of the PH scenario: o/p-NH2D=2.85+-0.05, o/p-NHD2=2.10+-0.06 (1 sigma). The o/p
ratios predicted by the PH scenario in the gas phase correspond to the nuclear
spin statistical weights, that is, o/p-NH2D=3, o/p-NHD2=2. In view of the fact
that H and D atom addition reactions on grain surfaces also result in these
ratios, it is reasonable to assume that the spin ratios of interstellar ammonia
and its deuterated forms are in general equal to their statistical values.

Result: 首次在IRAS 18162-2048大质量原恒星附近探测到3-5%的射电连续谱圆偏振信号，并估算出其表面磁场强度大于20-35高斯。

Abstract: Polarization measurements provide strong constraints on magnetic fields in
star-forming systems. While magnetic field estimates of a few kiloGauss (kG)
have been obtained near the surface of low-mass protostars, there are no
analogous measurements in the immediate vicinity of the surface of massive
protostars. We report the measurement of radio continuum circular polarization
(CP) towards a massive protostar IRAS 18162-2048 for the first time wielding
Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations. The fractional CP varies
between $3-5\%$ across the observed frequency range of $4-6$ GHz. We consider
multiple hypotheses for the production of CP and propose (i) gyrosynchrotron
emission and (ii) Faraday conversion due to turbulence in the magnetic medium -
both driven by mildly relativistic electrons as plausible mechanisms. We
estimate, for the first time, a magnetic field $B\gtrsim20-35$ G close to the
massive protostar. The Lorentz factor of the low energy electrons is estimated
to be in the range $\gamma_{min}\sim5-7$ for gyrosynchrotron emission and
$80-100$ for Faraday conversion from our observations. The magnetic field
estimate can provide important constraints to the formation models of massive
stars.

*Floor van Donkelaar,Pedro R. Capelo,Lucio Mayer,Darren S. Reed,Thomas R. Quinn*

**TL;DR**: 通过Phoebos流体宇宙学模拟发现，早期星系（z≳8）在弱恒星反馈条件下通过高效恒星形成快速增长，支持宇宙黎明时期恒星质量快速聚集的假说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 探索宇宙黎明末期星系形成与演化的物理机制。

Data: 使用了Phoebos流体动力学宇宙学模拟数据，这是一个先进的100 Mpc体积模拟，专门研究宇宙黎明末期和再电离时期星系的形成与演化。

Method: 采用Phoebos流体动力学宇宙学模拟，结合弱恒星反馈模型和多相气体辐射冷却模型，研究早期星系形成。

Result: Phoebos模拟表明仅需温和恒星反馈调控的高效恒星形成驱动了宇宙黎明时期的早期星系快速生长。

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) now allows us to observe galaxies at
the end of cosmic dawn ($z \sim 10-15$) with unprecedented detail, revealing
their morphologies, sizes, and internal structures. These observations offer
crucial insights into the physical processes driving early galaxy formation. In
this work, we introduce the Phoebos hydrodynamical cosmological simulation, a
state-of-the-art 100 Mpc volume designed to study the formation and evolution
of galaxies at the end of cosmic dawn and into the epoch of reionization.
Phoebos includes a stellar feedback model that is intentionally weak, in order
to address the high abundance of massive galaxies seen by JWST at early epochs.
At variance with most large cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, we do not
employ an effective equation of state model, instead our radiative cooling
model allows us to capture the multi-phase nature of the gas inside and around
galaxies. Phoebos reproduces key observables of early galaxy formation at $z
\gtrsim 8$, including the stellar mass function and the stellar-to-halo mass
relation. It also recovers the observed slope of the stellar size-to-mass
relation and matches the specific star formation rate remarkably well. These
results suggest that highly efficient star formation in the presence of only
mild regulation from stellar feedback, drives early galaxy growth, supporting a
scenario of rapid stellar mass assembly during cosmic dawn. There are
indications in the cosmic star formation density that, at lower redshifts,
Phoebos might overpredict the stellar mass within the systems, suggesting that
a transition to a stronger stellar feedback may be necessary to reproduce
later-time observations. These results highlight the potential of Phoebos to
interpret JWST observations and to probe the evolving physical processes that
shape galaxy formation.

**TL;DR**: 研究发现中心聚集气体云中形成的星团密度分布符合Plummer模型但更集中，气体主要在中心区域坍缩和抛射，恒星形成效率取决于大质量恒星形成时间和整体恒星形成时标。


<details>

Background: 研究恒星团在气体云中形成时的早期动力学演化及其密度分布发展。

Data: 使用 \texttt{Torch} 框架整合 \texttt{FLASH} 磁流体力学代码和 \texttt{AMUSE} 进行模拟，研究质量为 $2.5\times 10^3\, M_\odot$ 的中心集中湍流球体塌缩过程，考察不同数值分辨率和恒星形成情景的影响。

Method: 采用 \texttt{Torch} 框架集成 \texttt{FLASH} 磁流体力学代码和 \texttt{AMUSE} 进行多物理耦合模拟，研究恒星形成、演化、动力学、辐射传输及气体磁流体力学过程。

Result: 最终恒星密度分布符合Plummer轮廓但比解析预测更中心集中。

Abstract: The study of star cluster evolution necessitates modeling how their density
profiles develop from their natal gas distribution. Observational evidence
indicates that many star clusters follow a Plummer density profile. However,
most studies have focused on the phase after gas ejection, neglecting the
influence of gas on early dynamical evolution. We investigate the development
of star clusters forming within gas clouds, particularly those with a centrally
concentrated gas profile. Simulations were conducted using the \texttt{Torch}
framework, integrating the \texttt{FLASH} magnetohydrodynamics code into
\texttt{AMUSE}. This permits detailed modeling of star formation, stellar
evolution, stellar dynamics, radiative transfer, and gas magnetohydrodynamics.
We study the collapse of centrally concentrated, turbulent spheres with a total
mass of $2.5\times 10^3\, M_\odot$, investigating the effects of varying
numerical resolution and star formation scenarios. The free-fall time is
shorter at the center than at the edges of the cloud, with a minimum value of
$0.55\,\mathrm{Myr}$. The key conclusions from this study are: (1) subclusters
initially form even in dense gas clouds; (2) the final stellar density profile
is consistent with a Plummer profile, but more centrally concentrated than
analytically predicted; (3) gas collapses globally toward the center on the
central free-fall time scale, contradicting the assumption in analytical models
of local fragmentation and star formation; (4) hence, gas is predominantly
ejected from the innermost regions; and (5) the final value of the SFE depends
on the mass and formation time of the most massive star as well as the overall
star formation timescale.

Abstract: We present \texttt{COMPASS}, a novel simulation-based inference framework
that combines score-based diffusion models with transformer architectures to
jointly perform parameter estimation and Bayesian model comparison across
competing Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. \texttt{COMPASS} handles
high-dimensional, incomplete, and variable-size stellar abundance datasets. %
Applied to high-precision elemental abundance measurements, \texttt{COMPASS}
evaluates 40 combinations of nucleosynthetic yield tables. The model strongly
favours Asymptotic Giant Branch yields from NuGrid and core-collapse SN yields
used in the IllustrisTNG simulation, achieving near-unity cumulative posterior
probability. Using the preferred model, we infer a steep high-mass IMF slope
and an elevated Supernova\,Ia normalization, consistent with prior solar
neighbourhood studies but now derived from fully amortized Bayesian inference.
% Our results demonstrate that modern SBI methods can robustly constrain
uncertain physics in astrophysical simulators and enable principled model
selection when analysing complex, simulation-based data.

Abstract: We examine scale and redshift dependence of mass-property relations (MPRs)
for five hot gas properties of two large group- and cluster-scale halo samples
realized by the IllustrisTNG, TNG-Cluster and FLAMINGO cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations. For intrinsic properties of i) hot gas mass
($M_{\rm gas}$), ii) spectroscopic-like temperature ($T_{\rm sl}$), iii)
soft-band X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$), and iv) X-ray ($Y_{\rm X}$) and v)
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich ($Y_{\rm SZ}$) thermal energies, we use MPR parameters to
infer mass proxy quality (MPQ) -- the implied scatter in total halo mass
conditioned on a property -- for halos with $M_{\rm 500c} \geq 10^{13}{\, {\rm
M}_\odot}$ at redshifts, $z \in \{0, 0.5, 1, 2\}$. We find: (1) in general,
scaling relation slopes and covariance display moderate to strong dependence on
halo mass, with redshift dependence secondary, (2) for halos with $M_{\rm 500c}
> 10^{14}{\, {\rm M}_\odot}$, scalings of $M_{\rm gas}$ and $Y_{\rm SZ}$
simplify toward self-similar slope and constant intrinsic scatter (5 and 10%,
respectively) nearly independent of scale, making both measures ideal for
cluster finding and characterization to $z=2$, (3) halo mass-conditioned
likelihoods of hot gas mass and thermal energy at fixed halo mass closely
follow a log-normal form, (4) despite normalization differences ranging up to
$0.4$ dex, there is good qualitative, and often quantitative, agreement between
the scale-dependent slopes and property covariance of the two simulations.
Slopes show appreciable redshift dependence at the group scale, while redshift
dependence of the scatter is exhibited by low mass FLAMINGO halos only, (5)
property correlations are largely consistent between the simulations, with
values that mainly agree with existing empirical measurements. We close with a
literature survey placing our MPR slopes and intrinsic scatter estimates into
context.

Abstract: Imaging of optical Galactic cirrus, the spatially resolved form of diffuse
Galactic light, provides important insights into the properties of the diffuse
interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way. While previous investigations have
focused mainly on the intensity characteristics of optical cirrus, their
morphological properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ
several complementary statistical approaches -- local intensity statistics,
angular power spectrum / $\Delta$-variance analysis, and Wavelet Scattering
Transform analysis -- to characterize the morphology of cirrus in deep optical
imaging data. We place our investigation of optical cirrus into a
multi-wavelength context by comparing the morphology of cirrus seen with the
Dragonfly Telephoto Array to that seen with space-based facilities working at
longer wavelengths (Herschel 250~$\mu m$, WISE 12~$\mu m$, and Planck
radiance), as well as with structures seen in the DHIGLS {\HI} column density
map. Our statistical methods quantify the similarities and the differences of
cirrus morphology in all these datasets. The morphology of cirrus at visible
wavelengths resembles that of far-infrared cirrus more closely than that of
mid-infrared cirrus; on small scales, anisotropies in the cosmic infrared
background and systematics may lead to differences. Across all dust tracers,
cirrus morphology can be well described by a power spectrum with a common
power-law index $\gamma\sim-2.9$. We demonstrate quantitatively that optical
cirrus exhibits filamentary, coherent structures across a broad range of
angular scales. Our results offer promising avenues for linking the analysis of
coherent structures in optical cirrus to the underlying physical processes in
the ISM that shape them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these morphological
signatures can be leveraged to distinguish and disentangle cirrus from
extragalactic light.

Abstract: We present the design for HALO7D-X, a survey of the stellar halo to
investigate the accretion history of the Milky Way. The survey will use a
combination of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Gaia data for sky position and
proper motions of faint stars (18<G<21.5 mag), while line-of-sight velocity,
distance, [Fe/H], and [alpha/Fe] will be measured using follow-up Keck
spectroscopy. The survey will cover 30 lines of sight, made up of multiple HST
archival fields and optimized for Keck DEIMOS spectroscopy. We use mock survey
observations of the Bullock and Johnston stellar halo simulations to
investigate the sensitivity of HALO7D-X to constrain the basic parameters of
the accretion history of our Galaxy's stellar halo. We find that we are
sensitive to the mass distribution and accretion timeline of the stellar halo
progenitors, but not their orbital circularity. We find that the simulated
halos fall into three different groups based on the similarities in their
distributions of the observable dimensions of our survey. These groups are also
distinct from each other in the mass distribution and accretion timeline of
their progenitor satellites, showing that by using similarities in our
observables among halos, we are able to identify similarities in their
accretion histories. With HALO7D-X we will compare real Milky Way data with
simulated halos and use this connection between observables and progenitor mass
and accretion timeline to learn about the formation of our Galaxy's stellar
halo.

Abstract: Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in galaxy mergers with separations
$<$ 1kpc are crucial to our understanding of SMBH growth, galaxy evolution, and
the evolution of SMBH binaries. Despite their importance, there are less than a
handful known, and most have been discovered serendipitously. In this work, we
employ a new selection method to systematically pre-select candidate advanced
mergers likely to contain unresolved substructure at sub-arcsecond scales. By
exploiting the large survey area and astrometric precision of the Wide-field
Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we
have identified a sample of 48 nearby advanced mergers that have red WISE
colors ($W_1-W_2>0.5$) indicative of accretion activity and significant
sub-arcsecond offsets between their optical and infrared coordinates as
measured by SDSS and WISE. We conducted high resolution adaptive optics (AO)
observations of this sample with the Keck NIRC2 camera in the $K_p$ band
($2.124 ~ \mu m$, $\Delta\lambda = 0.351 \mu m$) to search for evidence of
previously unresolved substructure suggested by the optical-to-infared offsets.
We find that a significant fraction (20/48 or 42%) of the sample shows
substructure tracing the SDSS/WISE offset and unresolved by SDSS, demonstrating
that our methodology is a promising pathway to find dual AGN in follow-up
spectroscopy. Archival optical Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging reveals
that substructure identified with Keck is often missed in the optical or
erroneously identified due to partial obscuration, underscoring the importance
of carrying out studies of late-stage mergers in the infrared.

Abstract: In the early 1970s, Jacob Bekenstein proposed that black holes possess an
entropy proportional to the area of their event horizon, introducing the
Generalized Second Law of thermodynamics. Stephen Hawking initially objected to
this idea, but his subsequent analysis of quantum field theory in curved
spacetime led to the prediction of Hawking radiation and the concept of black
hole temperature. This study offers a concise overview of the development of
black hole thermodynamics between 1972 and 1975, highlighting the theoretical
evolution of both Bekenstein's and Hawking's contributions. The work also
reflects on the lasting impact of these developments on modern theoretical
physics and quantum gravity.

Abstract: We have investigated the bright ring-like features and polarization
structures
  in the Kerr-Sen black hole's images based on general relativistic radiative
transfer (GRRT) simulations, which are illuminated by the 230 GHz thermal
synchrotron emission from the radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAF).
Using the REx method, we extracted the bright ring from the black hole images
and found that both the bright ring and black hole shadow shrink as the
dilation parameter increases. Combing with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)
observational data of SgrA*, we present the allowed ranges of black hole
parameters for different observed inclinations and disk thicknesses. Our
results show that effects of the disk thickness on the allowed parameter space
are more strong than those of the observed inclination. We also probe the
rotational symmetry of EVPA in the polarization structure of the black hole
images by analyzing the coefficient $\beta_2$. The dilaton parameter results in
that the real part $Re\beta_2$ increases and the imaginary part $Im\beta_2$
decreases, but the magnitude $|\beta_2|$ generally exhibits a declining trend.
Finally, we find that effects of the disk thickness on $\beta_2$ are much
weaker than those from the dilaton parameter.

Abstract: We study the periapsis shift of timelike bound orbits in the Zipoy-Voorhees
spacetime, which is an exact, static, axisymmetric, and vacuum solution
characterized by the deformation parameter $\gamma$, including the
Schwarzschild spacetime as $\gamma=1$. We derive both the exact formula for the
periapsis shift of a quasi-circular orbit and the formula for the periapsis
shift by the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion. We show that the periapsis shift in
the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime for $1/11 < \gamma \leq 1/5$ is the same as in the
Schwarzschild spacetime to the 2PN order if $e=\sqrt{(\gamma^{-1}-5)/6}$, where
$e$ is the eccentricity of the orbit. Furthermore, we show that the parameter
$\gamma$ and the corresponding quadrupole moment $\tilde{M}_2$ of the
supermassive compact object at Sagittarius A* are constrained to $\gamma
\gtrsim 1.7 \times 10^{-2}$ and $\tilde{M}_2 \lesssim 1.2 \times 10^3$,
respectively, from observational data on S2 using the obtained PN expansion
formula. Finally, we derive a new series representation for the periapsis shift
in the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime using a recently proposed prescription, which
shows fast convergence not only in the weak-field regime but also for small
eccentricity.

type D (unlike the Kerr-Melvin spacetime). Three physical parameters are the
black hole mass $m$, its rotation $a$, and the external field value $B$. For
vanishing $B$ the metric directly reduces to standard Boyer-Lindquist form of
the Kerr black hole, while for zero $m$ we recover conformally flat
Bertotti-Robinson universe with a uniform Maxwell field. For zero $a$ the
spacetime is contained in the Van den Bergh-Carminati solution which can be
understood as the Schwarzschild black hole in a magnetic field. Our family of
black holes with non-aligned Maxwell hair - that can be called the
Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black holes - may find application in various
studies ranging from mathematical relativity to relativistic astrophysics.

Background: 探索宇宙中重元素（特别是快中子俘获过程产生的元素）的起源及其物理条件。

Method: 采用高分辨率紫外光谱技术分析恒星中的快速中子俘获过程元素。

Result: 利用HWO的高分辨率紫外光谱可将冷星中可探测的r过程元素数量增加50%以上。

Abstract: We present the science case for characterizing the origin of the heaviest
elements on the periodic table, with a focus on those produced by the rapid
neutron-capture process (r-process), using the Habitable Worlds Observatory
(HWO). High-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy can increase the number of
r-process elements detectable in cool stars by more than 50% relative to
optical and infrared spectra. These elements are key to characterizing the
physical conditions that govern the r-process and identify the nature, sites,
and environments where r-process events occurred. HWO has the potential to
greatly expand the sample of stars where rarely studied heavy elements can be
detected beyond the Solar neighborhood to the Galactic halo, globular clusters,

Abstract: We present the science case for characterizing the nature of the first stars
using the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). High-resolution ultraviolet (UV)
spectroscopy with the HWO has the potential to confirm any surviving low-mass
zero-metallicity first stars by placing unprecedented low limits on their metal
abundances. It also has the potential to substantially increase the number of
elements detectable in the spectra of known long-lived low-mass stars, which
exhibit extremely low metal abundances that reveal the metals produced by the
first stars. Elements important for this science case with UV transitions
include C, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn. HWO would
expand the discovery space when compared with the Hubble Space Telescope by
enabling high-resolution UV spectroscopy for much fainter stars throughout the

Abstract: Very massive stars (VMS) are defined as stars with an initial mass in excess
of 100 Msun. Because of their short lifetime and the shape of the stellar mass
function, they are rare objects. Only about twenty of them are known in the
Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud. However VMS are important in several
ways. They efficiently spread nucleosynthesis products through their boosted
stellar winds, they are predicted to explode as pair-instability supernovae or
to form heavy black-holes from direct collapse, and they outshine all other
types of stars in the ultraviolet light, thus dominating the integrated light
of starbursts. Their presence is indirectly suspected across all redshifts, all
the way to cosmic dawn where they may have played a key role in the formation
of the first galaxies. Their search and identification is currently hampered by
instrumental limitation, especially spatial resolution. An integral field
spectrograph working at the diffraction limit of HWO (5mas) and with a spectral
resolution of about 2000 would revolutionize the understanding of VMS. We make
the case for such an instrument in this contribution.

**TL;DR**: 通过多波段光度函数量化了活动星系核的X射线与射电光度关系，发现最高光度吸积事件更可能与喷流产生相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究活动星系核（AGN）的多维光度函数及其在X射线和射电波段的辐射特性。

Data: 数据来源于Boötes和COSMOS天区的1891个射电和X射线探测到的河外源样本。

Method: 采用多维光度函数量化活动星系核群体，描述X射线和射电光度共同作用下的源空间密度。

Result: 在最亮X射线和射电光度下，双波段探测比例接近100%，表明最高光度吸积事件更可能与喷流产生相关。

Abstract: We present new methods to quantify the AGN population in terms of a
multi-dimensional luminosity function that describes the space density of
sources as a function of both X-ray and radio luminosity. We compile a sample
of 1891 radio and X-ray detected extragalactic sources from the Bo\"otes and
COSMOS fields. First, we investigate the X-ray--radio luminosity correlation in
the sample and find that an apparent correlation is introduced due to the
sensitivity limits of the surveys; when considering individual redshift bins we
find a wide range of radio luminosities associated with a given X-ray
luminosity, and vice versa, indicating little direct connection between the
emission processes. We then measure the X-ray luminosity function, radio
luminosity function and multi-dimensional X-ray--radio luminosity function
across redshift ($0<z<6$). We apply luminosity thresholds in X-ray and radio to
restrict our sample to those in the AGN-dominated regime and explore how the
fraction of radio-selected AGN within the overall X-ray sample varies with
increasing X-ray luminosity (and vice versa). We find that towards the highest
X-ray and radio luminosities the fraction of sources with both an X-ray and
radio detection increases towards 100%, indicating that at the highest
luminosities we are more likely to obtain a detection in both bands, though the
source will not necessarily be bright in both bands. Thus, the most luminous
accretion events are more likely to be associated with the production of a jet,
despite the distinct physical structures that produce the emission and likely
persist over very different timescales.

Result: 揭示了耀变体在平谱射电类星体和蝎虎座BL型天体之间存在连续演化谱，支持从辐射高效到低效吸积的渐进演化模型。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques are increasingly used
across astrophysics, enabled by the growing availability of data and improved
acquisition methods. These approaches now support tasks from redshift
estimation to source classification. In this work, we aim to (i) classify
blazars from the Fermi 4LAC-DR3 catalogue, in particular to identify the likely
origin of blazars of uncertain type (BCUs), and (ii) investigate the full
blazar sample to study their structure and redshift-luminosity evolution. We
focus especially on the transition region between Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars
(FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), which may yield insights into
accretion disk evolution. We examine Changing-Look Blazars (CLBs) as potential
intermediates in this transition. We implement a classification pipeline using
both a strong benchmark model (XGBoost) and a foundation model pre-trained on
millions of tabular datasets (TabPFN). By extracting and reducing the
high-dimensional latent space of the best model, we provide a 2D representation
of the blazar population. This reveals a continuum between FSRQs and BL Lacs,
including CLBs as transitional sources. These results support a scenario of
gradual evolution from radiatively efficient (FSRQ-like) to inefficient (BL
Lac-like) accretion. Ultimately, we show that a single probability score,
combined with the latent space, offers a new framework for interpreting blazar
diversity beyond discrete classes.

Result: 发现16个伽马射线发射巨型射电源，其中8个为首次报道，其伽马射线特性与非巨型射电源的未对准活动星系核相似，表明两者伽马射线发射机制可能相同。

Abstract: Giant radio sources, including galaxies and quasars (hereafter GRGs), are
active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosting relativistic jets with source sizes
exceeding the projected length of 0.7 Mpc. They are crucial to understanding
the evolution of radio sources and their interaction with the surrounding
environment. Some of these enigmatic objects, e.g., NGC 315, have also been
reported as gamma-ray emitters. Since GRGs are thought to be aligned close to
the plane of the sky, they are invaluable targets to explore the radiative
mechanisms responsible for the observed gamma-ray emission. We have carried out
a systematic search of gamma-ray emitting GRGs using sensitive low-resolution
radio surveys, such as by Low Frequency Array, NRAO VLA Sky Survey, and Rapid
ASKAP Continuum Survey, and considering the fourth data release of the fourth
Fermi-Large Area Telescope gamma-ray source (4FGL-DR4) catalog. By carefully
inspecting the radio maps of all AGN included in the 4FGL-DR4 catalog, we have
identified 16 gamma-ray emitting GRGs, including 8 of them being reported as
GRGs for the first time. Some of their observed parameters, e.g., core
dominance, appeared to differ from that found for the non-gamma-ray detected
GRG population, possibly due to the relatively small viewing angle of the
gamma-ray emitting jet. The observed gamma-ray properties of these objects were
found to be similar to non-GRG gamma-ray emitting misaligned AGN. We conclude
that the origin of the gamma-ray emission could be similar in both source
populations.

Abstract: The processes governing the production of astrophysical high-energy neutrinos
are still debated, and the sources originating them remain an open question.
Among the putative emitters, active galactic nuclei have gained increasing
attention. Blazars, in particular, stand out due to their ability to accelerate
particles in environments with external radiation fields. Recent observations
suggest they may contribute to the neutrino flux detected by IceCube. We study
the physical properties of a subsample of 52 blazars proposed as candidate
neutrino emitters, based on a positional cross-correlation analysis between
IceCube hotspots and the 5BZCat catalog. We aim to provide a first
characterization of their central engines and physical nature, to explore the
potential link with neutrino production. We analyze the optical spectroscopic
properties of the 52 candidate neutrino-emitter blazars to infer their
accretion regime. The study is complemented by radio and $\gamma$-ray data,
which trace the intrinsic jet power. We compare the sample to other blazar
populations in the literature, perform statistical tests, and explore, through
simulations, the applicability of methods that include censored data. Overall,
the target sample shows properties compatible with the reference samples. We
observe a mild tendency to prefer objects with intense radiation fields,
typical of radiatively efficient accretors, and high radio power. Among them,
24 are detected by Fermi-LAT, spanning various $\gamma$-ray luminosities. We
also show that statistical tests commonly used in the literature need to be
handled with caution, as they are sensitive to the number of censored data and
the sample size.

Abstract: We present a systematic search for spatial association between a
high-confidence sample of 3,166 morphologically selected galaxy mergers
detected through SDSS imaging and the 4FGL-DR4 catalog of gamma-ray sources
detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Using a conservative
4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold and a Poisson-based statistical
framework, we identify 21 statistically significant associations with match
probabilities $p < 0.05$. Among these are known classes of gamma-ray emitters
such as flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), BL Lacertae objects (BLL), and
radio galaxies bolstering the hypothesis that merger-driven processes can fuel
high-energy activity. Intriguingly, five of the associated sources remain
unclassified in 4FGL-DR4, hinting at a possible link between galaxy mergers and
a hitherto unrecognized population of gamma-ray sources. The dominance of
AGN-like matches supports the scenario in which mergers trigger accretion onto
central supermassive black holes, initiating AGN activity observable at
gamma-ray energies. Moreover, the recurrent presence of unassociated sources
among secure matches underscores the potential of merger catalogs as physically
motivated priors in gamma-ray source identification efforts. This work
constitutes the first dedicated effort to explore associations between
gamma-ray sources and a large, morphologically selected sample of galaxy
mergers, opening new avenues for understanding the role of interactions in
high-energy astrophysics. We additionally examined the sample of 70 galaxy
pairs from the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Field Galaxy
Redshift Survey and found no statistically significant matches, with $p < 0.05$
within the 4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold.

Abstract: The powerful jets of blazars have been historically considered as likely
sites of high-energy cosmic-ray acceleration. However, particulars of the
launched jet and the locations of leptonic and hadronic jet loading remain
unclear. In the case when leptonic and hadronic particle injection occur
jointly, a temporal correlation between synchrotron radiation and neutrino
production is expected. We use a first catalog of millimeter (mm) wavelength
blazar light curves from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope for a time-dependent
correlation with twelve years of muon neutrino events from the IceCube South
Pole Neutrino Observatory. Such mm emission is known to trace activity of the
bright jet base, which is often self-absorbed at lower frequencies and
potentially gamma-ray opaque. We perform an analysis of the population, as well
as analyses of individual, selected sources. We do not observe a significant
signal from the stacked population. TXS 0506+056 is found as the most
significant, individual source, though this detection is not globally
significant in our analysis of selected AGN. Our results suggest that the
majority of mm-bright blazars are neutrino dim. In general, it is possible that
many blazars have lighter, leptonic jets, or that only selected blazars provide
exceptional conditions for neutrino production.

Abstract: Disc winds play a crucial role in many accreting astrophysical systems across
all scales. In accreting white dwarfs (AWDs) and active galactic nuclei (AGN),
radiation pressure on spectral lines is a promising wind-driving mechanism.
However, the efficiency of line driving is extremely sensitive to the
ionization state of the flow, making it difficult to construct a reliable
physical picture of these winds. Recently, we presented the first
radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations for AWDs that incorporated detailed,
multi-dimensional ionization calculations via fully frequency-dependent
radiative transfer, using the Sirocco code coupled to PLUTO. These simulations
produced much weaker line-driven winds (Mdot_wind / Mdot_acc < 1e-5 for our
adopted parameters) than earlier studies using more approximate treatments of
ionization and radiative transfer (which yielded Mdot_wind / Mdot_acc ~ 1e-4).
One remaining limitation of our work was the assumption of an isothermal
outflow. Here, we relax this by adopting an ideal gas equation of state and
explicitly solving for the multi-dimensional temperature structure of the flow.
In the AWD setting, accounting for the thermal state of the wind does not
change the overall conclusions drawn from the isothermal approximation. Our new
simulations confirm the line-driving efficiency problem: the predicted outflows
are too highly ionized, meaning they neither create optimal driving conditions
nor reproduce the observed ultraviolet wind signatures. Possible solutions
include wind clumping on sub-grid scales, a softer-than-expected spectral
energy distribution, or additional driving mechanisms. With the physics now
built into our simulations, we are well-equipped to also explore line-driven
disc winds in AGN.

**TL;DR**: 首次对星际彗星2I/Borisov进行完整近日点观测，发现其尘埃发射平滑、气体产生对称，呈现碳贫乏且NH2富集的独特组成特征。

Background: 首次对星际彗星2I/Borisov整个近日点通道进行了成分表征研究。

Data: 数据来源于欧洲南方天文台甚大望远镜（ESO VLT）的积分场光谱仪MUSE在2019年11月14日至2020年3月19日期间对星际彗星2I/Borisov进行的16次全面光学观测。

Method: 采用欧洲南方天文台甚大望远镜（VLT）的多单元光谱探测仪（MUSE）进行积分场光谱观测，分析彗发中C$_2$、NH$_2$和CN的气体产生率及尘埃发射特征。

Result: 首次观测到星际彗星2I/Borisov在近日点期间呈现碳贫化且NH$_2$相对富集的独特组成特征。

Abstract: The interstellar comet 2I/Borisov is the first interstellar object where
compositional characterisation was possible throughout its entire perihelion
passage. We report all 16 epochs of a comprehensive optical observation
campaign with ESO VLT's integral field spectrograph MUSE, spanning 126 days
from 2019 November 14 to 2020 March 19. The spatial dust emission of 2I/Borisov
was predominantly smooth, with no seasonal effect. A jet-like feature was
consistently visible. The gas production morphology of its coma was also smooth
and similar for C$_2$, NH$_2$, and CN: symmetric around the photocentre. The
production rates of these species gently declined into and beyond perihelion,
until 2I's outburst and splitting event in early 2020 March. C$_2$, NH$_2$, and
CN production rates all increased, with NH$_2$ being the most significant; the
dust emission also slightly reddened. 2I/Borisov is a carbon-depleted,
relatively NH$_2$-rich comet when compared to those comets yet measured in the
Solar System.

Abstract: Free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs) are known to harbor disks at
young ages. Here, we present 1-13 $\mu m$ spectra for eight young FFPMOs with
masses of 5-10 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ (at ages of 1-5 Myr), using the NIRSpec and
MIRI instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope. We derive fundamental
properties of these targets, and find spectral types of M9.5 to L4, with
effective temperatures of 1600-1900 K. The photospheric spectra of our targets
show a clear diversity at similar temperatures, especially in the 3-5 $\mu m$
range, unaccounted for by existing atmospheric models. We find a silicate
absorption feature in the photosphere of one of our targets, the first such
detection in very young FFPMOs, indicating silicate clouds in their cool
atmospheres. Six of our objects show mid-infrared excess emission above the
photosphere, as well as silicate emission features, demonstrating the presence
of disks. The shape and strength of the latter features constitute strong
evidence of grain growth and crystallization, similar to what is seen in more
massive brown dwarfs and stars. We also detect emission lines from hydrocarbon
molecules in the disks of several targets. These are the lowest mass isolated
objects found so far with silicate and hydrocarbon emission features arising in
their disks. The presence of disks and their characteristics point to the
potential for the formation of rocky companions around free-floating
planetary-mass objects.

Abstract: The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object to be
discovered. Pre-perihelion measurements provide a unique opportunity to study
its activity and composition, which may alter as it is heated in the coming
months. We provide an initial baseline from optical spectroscopic observations
obtained only two days after discovery, using the MUSE instrument on the VLT on
2025 July 3, while 3I was at 4.47 au from the Sun and 3.46 au from the Earth.
These observations confirm the cometary nature of 3I, and reveal a red coma
with a spectral slope of $(18\pm4)\%/1000$~\AA, redder than most Solar System
comets but similar to the surface colour of some Solar System Trans-Neptunian
Objects or Centaurs. We searched for but did not detect gas emission from
C$_2$, NH$_2$, CN, and [OI], which is consistent with volatile non-detections
for Solar System comets at this heliocentric distance. At present, the coma
appears entirely dusty. Future observations of 3I as it comes closer to the Sun
will provide an invaluable opportunity to witness the evolution of its
activity, study its composition, test predictions of interstellar object
population models, and compare 3I to Solar System comets.

Abstract: We describe the physical characteristics of interstellar comet 3I\ATLAS,
discovered on 2025 July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System.
The comet has eccentricity, $e$ $\simeq$ 6.08 and velocity at infinity,
v$_{\infty}$ $\simeq$ 57 km/s, indicating an interstellar origin. We obtained
g, r, i photometry with the Palomar 200-inch Next Generation Palomar
Spectrograph on 2025 July 3. We measured colour indices g-r = 0.43$\pm$0.02
mag, r-i = 0.16$\pm$0.02 mag, and g-i = 0.59$\pm$0.03 mag and a spectral slope
of 1.3$\pm$0.9 $\%$/100 nm. We calculate the dust cross-section within 10,000
km of the comet to be 230.0$\pm$5.2 km$^2$, assuming an albedo of 0.10. The
FWHM of 3I\ATLAS's detection is $\sim$2.2 arcsec as measured in our r-band
images and has A(0$^\circ$)f$\rho$ of 287.2$\pm$2.8 cm. Finally, we use the
sunward extent of the coma to constrain the dust ejection speed, finding that
\textmu m-scale to mm-scale particles have $\sim$0.01-1 m/s, implying the
comet's dust mass-loss rate is $\sim$0.1 - 1.0 kg/s.

Result: 提出了一种基于可微分场级神经网络的方法，能准确预测暗物质晕丰度及其对宇宙学参数的依赖性。

Abstract: Modern cosmological inference increasingly relies on differentiable models to
enable efficient, gradient-based parameter estimation and uncertainty
quantification. Here, we present a novel approach for predicting the abundance
of dark matter haloes and their cosmology dependence using a differentiable,
field-level neural network (NN) model, and study how well the cosmology
dependence is captured by common parametrisations of the halo mass function
(HMF), and by our NN-based approach. By training a 3D U-Net on initial density
fields from fast N-body simulations with varying cosmological parameters, we
enable direct, differentiable mapping from the linear density field to
protohalo patches and their mass bins. Our method achieves competitive accuracy
in identifying protohalo regions and in capturing the dependence of the HMF on
cosmological parameters. Our NN derivatives agree well with finite differences
of both analytical and emulated HMFs, at the level of the disagreement among
the different models. We further demonstrate how the NN model can additionally
be used to investigate the response of the HMF to changes in the initial
Gaussian random field. Finally, we also demonstrate that a differentiable model
can be used to extrapolate existing models at very high precision.

Abstract: As part of the SKYSURF Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Legacy Archival program
we present galaxy number counts which yield measurements of the extragalactic
background light (EBL) at 15 different wavelengths. We have processed 82,752
HST images across 23 filters into 16,686 mosaics using the same software and
processing pipeline throughout. Using 17/23 filters that give reliable galaxy
counts, we constrain the integrated galaxy light (IGL) with a 1.5-9\% error
between 0.3 and 1.6 $\mu$m in combination with 8 bands from WAVES (Wide Area
VISTA Extragalactic Survey) and DEVILS (Deep Extragalactic Visible Legacy
Survey). While HST was never intended to undertake large area surveys, through
extensive quality control and filtering, we were able to extract a reliable and
representative sample of fields distributed across the sky. Our final catalogs
cover a combined $\approx 19.6 \deg^2$, with individual filters covering areas
ranging from $\approx 0.16-7.0 \deg^2$. The combination of numerous independent
sight-lines and area coverage allows us to reduce cosmic variance uncertainties
in deep number counts to 0.06\%-1.8\%. For the first time we are able to
establish a measurement of the IGL, $\mathrm{9.07 \pm 0.35 nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}}$,
at 0.59 $\mu$m using HST data. We obtain a cosmic optical background value of $
24.45 \pm 0.50 \mathrm{nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}}$. Different techniques used to
measure the COB, both directly and indirectly, have recently converged
indicating that the COB arises almost exclusively from processes within
galaxies. This in combination with the recent values reported from New Horizons
and very high energy (VHE) constraints leaves very little room for any diffuse
emission coming from outside the Milky Way.

Result: 模拟的类科尔莫戈罗夫湍流与XRISM观测结果一致，表明现有观测数据不支持比科尔莫戈罗夫湍流更陡的湍流谱。

Abstract: We investigate whether the properties of turbulent gas motions recently
measured via X-ray spectroscopy in the Coma cluster of galaxies by XRISM are in
tension with the "classical" fluid picture of the intracluster medium on large
scales, as produced by a typical high-resolution cosmological simulation. We
use a high-resolution simulation of Coma-like cluster of galaxies and show that
the Kolmogorov-like turbulence measured in the simulation yields to velocity
structure functions and line-width that fully compatible with those measured by
the XRISM observation of Coma. These results highlight the combined biases
driven by the inhomogeneity of turbulence in the intracluster medium and by the
X-ray weighting in observations, and appear to release the tension between the
XRISM data and current numerical simulations, showing that a turbulent spectrum
much steeper than Kolmogorov is not required by current observational data.

Abstract: We attempt to measure the $z = 8.2$ Epoch of Reionization (EoR) 21-cm
bispectrum (BS) using Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) $154.2~\mathrm{MHz}$
data. We find that $B(k_{1\perp}, k_{2\perp}, k_{3\perp}, k_{1\parallel},
k_{2\parallel})$ the 3D cylindrical BS exhibits a foreground wedge, similar to
$P(k_{1\perp},k_{1\parallel})$ the 21-cm cylindrical power spectrum. However,
the BS foreground wedge, which depends on $(k_{1\perp},k_{1\parallel})$,
$(k_{2\perp},k_{2\parallel})$ and $(k_{3\perp},k_{3\parallel})$ the three sides
of a triangle, is more complicated. Considering various foreground avoidance
scenarios, we identify the region where all three sides are outside the
foreground wedge as the EoR window for the 21-cm BS. However, the EoR window is
contaminated by a periodic pattern of spikes that arises from the periodic
pattern of missing frequency channels in the data. We evaluate the binned 3D
spherical BS for triangles of all possible sizes and shapes, and present
results for $\Delta^3$ the mean cube brightness temperature fluctuations. The
best $2\sigma$ upper limits we obtain for the EoR 21-cm signal are
$\Delta^3_{\rm UL} = (1.81\times 10^3)^3~\mathrm{mK}^3$ at $k_1 =
0.008~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\Delta^3_{\rm UL} = (2.04\times
10^3)^3~\mathrm{mK}^3$ at $k_1 = 0.012~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for equilateral and
squeezed triangles, respectively. These are foreground-dominated, and are many
orders of magnitude larger than the predicted EoR 21-cm signal $(\sim 10^3
~\mathrm{mK}^3)$.
