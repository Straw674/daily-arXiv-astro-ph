### [1] [Formation and evolution of boxy/peanut bulges in the Auriga cosmological simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13590)
*Paula D. López,Francesca Fragkoudi,Sofía A. Cora,Cecilia Scannapieco,Rüdiger Pakmor,Robert J. J. Grand,Facundo Gómez,Federico Marinacci*

**TL;DR**: 通过Auriga磁流体动力学宇宙学模拟，研究了X形或盒状/花生状（b/p）凸起的形成和演化，发现其形成时间、尺寸及在宇宙历史中的分布与观测趋势一致，但模拟中的b/p比例略低于部分观测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 盒状/花生状（b/p）或X形凸起在孤立星系的理论和数值模拟中已被广泛研究，但直到最近，宇宙学流体动力学模拟的进展才使得在宇宙学背景下探索b/p凸起成为可能，其形成和演化仍有许多未解之谜。

Data: 使用了Auriga磁流体动力学宇宙学zoom-in模拟数据。

Method: 开发了一种估计b/p强度的方法，用于识别这些结构的形成时间和尺寸。

Result: 研究发现b/p凸起在棒形成后约1.1-1.6 Gyr内形成，经历‘弯曲’事件；在z=0时，b/p凸起的范围约为棒长度的一半，且b/p比例在z=0时为45%，随红移增加而下降，与观测趋势一致但比例略低。

Abstract: Boxy/peanut (b/p) or X-shaped bulges have been extensively explored with
theory and numerical simulations of isolated galaxies. However, it is only
recently that advances in hydrodynamical cosmological simulations have made it
possible to explore b/p bulges in a cosmological setting, with much remaining
to be understood about their formation and evolution. By using the Auriga
magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations, we characterise the
structural parameters of b/p bulges and how they form and evolve throughout
cosmic history. We develop a method for estimating the b/p strength that allows
us to identify the formation time and size of these structures. We find that
b/p bulges in Auriga form between $\sim 1.1-1.6\, \mathrm Gyr$ after bar
formation, following a `buckling' episode; some galaxies undergo multiple
bucklings and events of b/p growth, with some b/p structures `dissolving'
between buckling events. We find that at $z=0$, the b/p bulges have an extent
of almost half the bar length. Finally, we analyse the evolution of the b/p
fraction over redshift, finding that at $z=0$, two thirds of galaxies host a
bar, and of these, $45$ per cent have a b/p. This b/p fraction is within the
observed range at $z=0$, although on the low end as compared to some
observational studies. The b/p fraction decreases to $20$ per cent at $z=0.5$,
and falls to zero at $z \sim 1$; this is in line with the observed trend of
declining b/p fraction with redshift. We discuss possible culprits for the
apparent mismatch in b/p occurrence between observations and cosmological
simulations, what causes them to form (or not) in these simulations, and what
this might reveal about models of galaxy formation and evolution.

### [2] [The High-redshift Blazar MG3 J163554+3629: Physical Properties and the Enigma of Its Unexpected Supermassive Black Hole Growth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13593)
*Jose Maria Sanchez Zaballa,Eugenio Bottacini,Andrea Tramacere*

**TL;DR**: 通过一区轻子模型对高红移平谱射电类星体MG3 J163554+3629的SED建模，推断出其黑洞质量、磁场强度及吸积效率，并探讨了黑洞增长的演化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 活动星系核（AGNs）的能量来源通常被认为是超大质量黑洞（SMBH）吸积物质，但其具体机制及黑洞增长过程尚不清楚，尤其是高红移AGNs。

Data: MG3 J163554+3629的射电至伽马射线光谱能量分布（SED）数据。

Method: 使用一区轻子模型对SED进行建模，并通过马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法估计不确定性。

Result: 推断出黑洞质量为1.1(+0.2,-0.1) x 10^9太阳质量，磁场强度为6.56(+0.13,-0.09) x 10^-2 G，吸积效率为0.083；研究还探讨了黑洞增长的演化过程，提出超爱丁顿过程或喷流存在可能加速黑洞增长。

Abstract: There is general consensus that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) derive their
radiating power from a supermassive black hole (SMBH) that accretes matter.
Yet, their precise powering mechanisms and the resulting growth of the SMBH are
poorly understood, especially for AGNs at high redshift. Blazars are AGNs
pointing their jet toward the observer, thus being detectable from radio
through gamma rays at high redshift due to Doppler boosting. The blazar MG3
J163554+3629 is located at redshift z=3.65 and it is a flat spectrum radio
quasar (FSRQ). In this work, we show the results of the modeling of its
spectral energy distribution (SED) from radio to gamma rays with a one-zone
leptonic model. We estimate the uncertainties through a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo approach. As a result, we infer the black hole mass M_BH = 1.1(+0.2,-0.1)
x 10^9 Msun and a modest magnetic field of B = 6.56(+0.13,-0.09) x 10^-2 G in
line with the Compton dominance observed in high-redshift FSRQs. The emitting
region is outside the broad line region but within the region of the dust torus
radius. The rather small accretion efficiency of eta=0.083 is not solely
inferred through the SED modeling but also through the energetics. An evolution
study suggests that in an Eddington-limited accretion process the SMBH did not
have time enough to grow from an initial seed mass of ~10^6 Msun at z~30 into a
mass of M_BH ~ 10^9 Msun at z=3.65. Faster mass growth might be obtained in a
super-Eddington process throughout frequent episodes. Alternative scenarios
propose that the existence of the jet itself can facilitate a more rapid
growth.

### [3] [Revealing the intricacies of radio galaxies and filaments in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 2255. I. Insights from deep LOFAR-VLBI sub-arcsecond resolution images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13595)
*E. De Rubeis,M. Bondi,A. Botteon,R. J. van Weeren,J. M. G. H. J. de Jong,L. Rudnick,G. Brunetti,K. Rajpurohit,C. Gheller,H. J. A. Röttgering*

**TL;DR**: 利用LOFAR-VLBI在144 MHz的深观测，研究Abell 2255星系团中非热丝状结构的形态和光谱特征，揭示了前所未有的细节，并探讨了其形成机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 现代干涉仪的高灵敏度揭示了射电星系周围的大量丝状结构，尤其是在星系团环境中。这些薄结构的形态和光谱特征需要结合高分辨率和低频观测，而LOFAR国际站提供了最佳观测条件。

Data: 使用LOFAR-VLBI在144 MHz的56小时深观测数据。

Method: 结合多次观测，采用LOFAR-VLBI进行高分辨率成像，详细描述了校准和成像策略。

Result: 揭示了Abell 2255星系团中射电星系周围非热丝状结构的细节，特别是Original TRG的尾部由多个长度和宽度不同的丝状结构组成，为研究其形成机制提供了基础。

Abstract: High sensitivity of modern interferometers is revealing a plethora of
filaments surrounding radio galaxies, especially in galaxy cluster
environments. The morphology and spectral characteristics of these thin
structures require the combination of high-resolution and low frequency
observations, which is best obtained using the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR)
international stations. In this paper, we aim to detect and characterize
non-thermal filaments observed close or as part of the radio galaxies in Abell
2255 using deep, LOFAR-VLBI observations at 144 MHz. These structures can be
used to disentangle possible scenarios for the origin of the non-thermal
filaments and connection to the motion of the host galaxy within the dense and
turbulent intracluster medium (ICM), and consequent interaction between the ICM
and radio jets. Combining multiple observations, we produced the deepest images
ever obtained with LOFAR-VLBI targeting a galaxy cluster, using 56 hours of
observations, reaching $0.3-0.5"$ resolution. We detailed throughout the paper
the calibration and imaging strategy for the different targets, as well as the
multitude of morphological features discovered. Thanks to the high-sensitivity
of LOFAR-VLBI, we revealed unprecedented details for the main cluster radio
galaxies, recovering in most cases also their more extended structure observed
only at such low frequencies. In particular, we focused on the Original Tailed
Radio Galaxy (Original TRG) where we distinguished many filaments constituting
its tail with varying lengths ($80-110$ kpc) and widths ($3-10$ kpc). The final
radio images showcase the potential of deep, high-resolution observations for
galaxy clusters. With such approach, we enabled the study of these thin,
elongated radio filaments: after being discovered, these filaments now require
spectral studies to determine their formation mechanisms.

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过ALMA-FAUST大项目的高分辨率观测，首次提供了原恒星风将大颗粒从内盘输送到包层的直接观测证据，支持了行星形成过程中颗粒生长的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 行星形成需要星际尘埃颗粒从毫米级增长到千米级。虽然数值模拟表明年轻原恒星内包层中的大颗粒（约毫米级）可能通过风从盘中被抬升，但目前仍缺乏原恒星风/外流中存在大颗粒的直接证据。

Data: 研究使用了ALMA-FAUST大项目中获得的L1551 IRS5包层（约3000 au）在1.3毫米和3毫米波段的尘埃热辐射高分辨率（50 au）观测数据。

Method: 通过分析CO外流腔壁（延伸至约1800 au）的尘埃辐射，研究了尘埃发射率指数βmm的变化，以识别颗粒生长的观测特征。

Result: 研究发现H2体积密度大于2×10^5 cm^-3，尘埃质量约58地球质量，βmm小于1，表明存在比典型星际介质颗粒大10^3倍的颗粒，首次提供了外流腔壁内大颗粒的空间分辨观测证据。

Abstract: Planet formation around young stars requires the growth of interstellar dust
grains from mm-sized particles to km-sized planetesimals. Numerical simulations
have shown that large ($\sim$mm-sized) grains found in the inner envelope of
young protostars could be lifted from the disc via winds. However we are still
lacking unambiguous evidence for large grains in protostellar winds/outflows.
We investigate dust continuum emission in the envelope of the Class I binary
L1551 IRS5 in the Taurus molecular cloud, aiming to identify observational
signatures of grain growth, such as variations in the dust emissivity index
($\beta_{\rm mm}$). In this context, we present new, high-angular resolution
(50 au), observations of thermal dust continuum emission at 1.3 mm and 3 mm in
the envelope ($\sim$3000 au) of L1551 IRS5 , obtained as part of the ALMA-FAUST
Large Program. We analyse dust emission along the cavity walls of the CO
outflow, extended up to $\sim$1800 au. We find an H$_2$ volume density
$>2\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, a dust mass of $\sim$58 M$_\oplus$, and $\beta_{\rm
mm}$<1, implying the presence of grains $\sim$10$^3$ times larger than the
typical ISM sizes. We provide the first spatially resolved observational
evidence of large grains within an outflow cavity wall. Our results suggest
that these grains have been transported from the inner disc to the envelope by
protostellar winds and may subsequently fall back into the outer disc by
gravity and/or via accretion streamers. This cycle provides longer time for
grains to grow, playing a crucial role in the formation of planetesimals.

### [5] [Constraining cosmic ray transport models using circumgalactic medium properties and observables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13597)
*Yue Samuel Lu,Dušan Kereš,Philip F. Hopkins,Sam B. Ponnada,Claude-André Faucher-Giguére,Cameron B. Hummels*

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过FIRE-2模拟分析了不同宇宙射线传输模型对银河系质量晕的CGM性质的影响，发现宇宙射线降低了星系质量和恒星形成率，同时增加了冷CGM气体，与观测更一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 宇宙射线（CRs）是星系形成和演化中重要的非热成分，但其在CGM中的传播机制尚不明确。

Data: 使用了FIRE-2模拟中相同银河系质量晕在z=0时的数据，结合不同CR传输模型。

Method: 通过模拟分析气体形态和热性质，并生成合成观测数据（如UV离子吸收柱和X射线发射）。

Result: CRs降低了星系质量和恒星形成率，增加了冷CGM气体，提升了HI和OVI柱密度，与观测更一致；X射线发射在星系附近主要由热发射和X射线双星主导，而更远的CGM可能由逆康普顿散射主导。

Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) are a pivotal non-thermal component of galaxy formation and
evolution. However, the intricacies of CR physics, particularly how they
propagate in the circumgalactic medium (CGM), remain largely unconstrained. In
this work, we study CGM properties in FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic
Environments) simulations of the same Milky Way (MW)-mass halo at $z=0$ with
different CR transport models that produce similar diffuse $\sim$ GeV
$\gamma$-ray emission. We study the gas morphology and thermal properties, and
generate synthetic observations of rest-frame UV ion absorption columns and
X-ray emission. CRs lower galaxy masses and star formation rates (SFRs) while
supporting more cool CGM gas, which boosts the HI and OVI column densities in
the CGM, bringing simulations more in line with observations, but there can be
large differences between CR transport models and resolution levels. X-ray
emission within and close to galaxies is consistent with thermal (free-free and
metal-line) emission plus X-ray binaries, while more extended ($\sim 100\,$kpc)
CGM emission is potentially dominated by inverse Compton (IC) scattering,
motivating future work on the spatially resolved X-ray profiles. Although
comparisons with observations are sensitive to sample selection and mimicking
the details of observations, and our analysis did not result in strong
constraints on CR models, the differences between simulations are significant
and could be used as a framework for future studies.

*Cameron R. Morgan,Elizaveta Sazonova,Ian D. Roberts,Michael L. Balogh,Joel Roediger,Laura Ferrarese,Patrick Côté,Alessandro Boselli,Matteo Fossati,Jean-Charles Cuillandre,Stephen Gwyn*

**TL;DR**: 本文分析了Virgo星系团中不同恒星形成状态星系的恒星质量函数，发现其形状在星系团内具有普遍性，并揭示了低质量星系中静止星系比例高于场星系的现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Virgo星系团的恒星质量函数（SMF）研究对于理解星系团内星系的形成和演化具有重要意义。目前的研究表明，星系团内星系的SMF斜率可能与场星系不同，但具体差异及其背后的物理机制尚不清楚。

Data: 使用了Next Generation Virgo Survey (NGVS)的恒星质量数据以及Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing Ionised Gas Emission (VESTIGE)的Hα数据。

Method: 通过Hα数据将星系分为恒星形成星系、静止星系和低恒星形成率星系，并分别分析它们的SMF形状及其在星系团内的分布。

Result: 研究发现，不同恒星形成状态星系的SMF形状在星系团内具有普遍性；低质量静止星系比例显著高于场星系；静止星系比例在星系团核心区域最高；低质量静止星系可能通过预处理的机制在星系团外围形成。

Abstract: We analyze deep ($M_*\gtrsim10^7~{M}_{\odot}$) galaxy stellar mass functions
(SMFs) of the Virgo cluster using stellar masses derived as part of the Next
Generation Virgo Survey (NGVS). The total SMF has a slope of
$\alpha=-1.35^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ which is similar to or steeper than typical
field values. Using deep \ha{} data from the Virgo Environmental Survey Tracing
Ionised Gas Emission (VESTIGE) we separate out star-forming galaxies, quiescent
galaxies with no ongoing star formation, and low-SFR galaxies that are
intermediate between these two populations. For each of these populations, the
shape of the SMF is found to be universal throughout the cluster, from the core
to the outskirts. The star-forming and quiescent SMFs show stark differences
with values seen in field galaxies. The relative fraction of quiescent galaxies
is highest in the core of the cluster, with low-SFR and star-forming galaxies
more significant in the outer regions of the cluster. At low stellar masses
($M_*\lesssim10^9~{M}_{\odot}$), the quiescent fraction in the main cluster is
significantly higher than that of the field and even satellites of massive
groups. At high stellar masses, the quiescent fraction is similar to other
studies of cluster galaxies. We model the quiescent population in the infall
region of the cluster as a combination of backsplash and field quiescent
galaxies, and find that the backsplash fractions needed to explain the observed
population are unrealistically high. This suggests the existence of a third
population of low-mass galaxies that are pre-processed outside the virial
radius of the cluster, possibly in groups prior to infall.

*I. Koutsouridou,Á. Skúladóttir,S. Salvadori*

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过校正非局部热力学平衡（NLTE）效应，改进了金属贫乏恒星化学丰度的测量，解决了模型与观测数据在碳铁比上的长期不一致问题，并提供了便于使用的在线工具NLiTE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 金属贫乏恒星的研究可以揭示早期化学富集过程，但现有的恒星丰度测量通常基于局部热力学平衡（LTE）假设，这可能导致系统误差。

Data: 研究使用了SAGA数据库中银河系金属贫乏恒星的最大目录，并首次提供了完全校正NLTE效应的数据。

Method: 研究利用公开的最新NLTE网格对SAGA目录进行校正，并开发了在线工具NLiTE，用于快速计算大样本恒星的NLTE校正值。

Result: 校正NLTE效应后，碳铁比的观测数据与模型（NEFERTITI）更加吻合，解决了长期的不一致问题；其他元素（如Na和Co）的丰度与模型的一致性有所变化，而Mg/Fe和Ca/Fe等比值变化不大。

Abstract: Early chemical enrichment processes can be revealed by the careful study of
metal-poor stars. In our Local Group, we can obtain spectra of individual stars
to measure their precise, but not always accurate, chemical abundances.
Unfortunately, stellar abundances are typically estimated under the simplistic
assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). This can systematically
alter both the abundance patterns of individual stars and global trends of
chemical enrichment. The SAGA database compiles the largest catalogue of
metal-poor stars in the Milky Way. For the first time, we provide the community
with the SAGA catalogue fully corrected for non-LTE (NLTE) effects, using
state-of-the-art publicly available grids. In addition, we present an
easy-to-use online tool NLiTE that quickly provides NLTE corrections for large
stellar samples. For further scientific exploration, NLiTE facilitates the
comparison of different NLTE grids to investigate their intrinsic
uncertainties. Finally, we compare the NLTE-SAGA catalogue with our
cosmological galaxy formation and chemical evolution model, NEFERTITI. By
accounting for NLTE effects, we can solve the long-standing discrepancy between
models and observations in the abundance ratio of [C/Fe], the best tracer of
the first stellar populations. At low [Fe/H]<-3.5, models are unable to
reproduce the high measured [C/Fe] in LTE, which are lowered in NLTE, aligning
with simulations. Other elements are a mixed bag: some show improved agreement
with models (e.g. Na) and others worse (e.g. Co). Few elemental ratios do not
change significantly (e.g. [Mg/Fe], [Ca/Fe]). Properly accounting for NLTE
effects is fundamental for interpreting the chemical abundances of metal-poor
stars. Our NLiTE tool thus enables a meaningful comparison of stellar samples
with stellar and chemical evolution models and low-metallicity gaseous
environments at higher redshift.

**TL;DR**: 通过自适应光学Ks波段观测，首次确认了高红移遗迹星系KiDS J0842+0059的盘状形态和紧凑结构，揭示了其与早期宇宙质量组装阶段的直接联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 遗迹星系是早期宇宙中形成的大质量、紧凑且静止的星系，未经历后续的合并和相互作用，为研究宇宙早期质量组装提供了独特机会。尽管本地宇宙中发现的遗迹星系数量有限，但INSPIRE项目在高红移（z约0.2-0.4）确认了38个遗迹星系。

Data: 使用SOUL-LUCI@LBT的自适应光学Ks波段观测数据，对INSPIRE项目中的极端遗迹星系KiDS J0842+0059（z约0.3）进行了高分辨率成像。

Result: 确认KiDS J0842+0059具有盘状形态（轴比0.24）和紧凑结构（有效半径约1千秒差距），其表面质量密度分布与本地极端遗迹星系NGC 1277和高红移红块星系相似，表明其为早期宇宙中形成的紧凑大质量星系的遗迹。

Abstract: Relics are massive, compact and quiescent galaxies that assembled the
majority of their stars in the early Universe and lived untouched until today,
completely missing any subsequent size-growth caused by mergers and
interactions. They provide the unique opportunity to put constraints on the
first phase of mass assembly in the Universe with the ease of being nearby.
While only a few relics have been found in the local Universe, the {\tt
INSPIRE} project has confirmed 38 relics at higher redshifts ($z \sim
0.2-0.4$), fully characterising their integrated kinematics and stellar
populations. However, given the very small sizes of these objects and the
limitations imposed by the atmosphere, structural parameters inferred from
ground-based optical imaging are possibly affected by systematic effects that
are difficult to quantify. In this paper, we present the first high-resolution
image obtained with Adaptive Optics Ks-band observations on SOUL-LUCI@LBT of
one of the most extreme {\tt INSPIRE} relics, KiDS~J0842+0059 at $z \sim 0.3$.
We confirm the disky morphology of this galaxy (axis ratio of $0.24$) and its
compact nature (circularized effective radius of $\sim 1$ kpc) by modelling its
2D surface brightness profile with a PSF-convolved S\'ersic model. We
demonstrate that the surface mass density profile of KiDS~J0842+0059 closely
resembles that of the most extreme local relic, NGC~1277, as well as of
high-redshift red nuggets. We unambiguously conclude that this object is a
remnant of a high-redshift compact and massive galaxy, which assembled all of
its mass at $z>2$, and completely missed the merger phase of the galaxy
evolution.

**TL;DR**: The G4Jy Sample compiles the brightest radio sources in the southern sky, providing host-galaxy identifications and spectral indices, and addresses the lack of spectroscopic redshifts through SALT observations, revealing new insights into active galactic nuclei and radio-galaxy properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The G4Jy Sample focuses on the brightest radio sources in the southern sky, many of which lack spectroscopic redshifts, hindering the study of their intrinsic properties. The study aims to fill this gap by providing new redshifts and improving understanding of active galactic nuclei.

Data: The study uses data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) through the GLEAM Survey, supplemented by optical spectroscopy from the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT), 6dFGS, and SDSS.

Method: The research involves careful visual inspection for host-galaxy identifications, optical spectroscopy for redshift determination, and combining data from multiple surveys to calculate radio luminosities and linear sizes.

Result: Initial results include new redshifts, the discovery of a giant radio-galaxy (G4Jy 604), and insights into the importance of radio-frequency selection for unbiased active galactic nuclei studies, with potential for future evolution studies.

Abstract: The GLEAM 4-Jy (G4Jy) Sample is a thorough compilation of the 'brightest'
radio sources in the southern sky (Declination < 30 deg), as measured at 151
MHz (S > 4.0 Jy) with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), through the GaLactic
and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) Survey. In addition to flux-density
measurements, the G4Jy catalogue provides host-galaxy identifications (through
careful visual-inspection) and four sets of spectral indices. Despite their
brightness in the radio, many of these sources are poorly-studied, with the
vast majority lacking a spectroscopic redshift in published work. This is
crucial for studying the intrinsic properties of the sources, and so we conduct
a multi-semester observing campaign on the Southern African Large Telescope
(SALT), with optical spectroscopy enabling us to provide new redshifts to the
astronomical community. Initial results show that not all of the host galaxies
exhibit emission-line spectra in the optical (~4500-7500 Ang), which
illustrates the importance of radio-frequency selection (rather than optical
selection) for creating an unbiased sample of active galactic nuclei. By
combining SALT redshifts with those from the 6-degree Field Galaxy Survey
(6dFGS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we calculate radio
luminosities and linear sizes for 299 G4Jy sources (which includes one
newly-discovered giant radio-galaxy, G4Jy 604). Furthermore, with the highest
redshift acquired (so far) being z ~ 2.2 from SDSS, we look forward to
evolution studies of this complete sample, as well as breaking degeneracies in
radio properties with respect to, for example, the galaxy environment.

Abstract: Galaxies with polar structures -- of which polar-ring galaxies (PRGs) are a
prominent subclass -- contain components that are kinematically decoupled and
highly inclined relative to the host galaxy's major axis. Modern deep optical
surveys provide a powerful means of detecting low surface brightness (LSB)
features around galaxies, offering critical insights into the formation and
evolution of galaxies with polar structures. UGC 10043 is an edge-on galaxy
notable for its prominent bulge, which extends orthogonally to the disk plane.
In addition, the galaxy displays a well-defined integral-shaped disk warp and
multiple dust features crossing the bulge along the minor galaxy axis. In this
work, we present new deep optical photometry of UGC 10043 down to 29.5 mag
arcsec$^{-2}$ and perform a detailed analysis of its LSB and polar structures.
The observations reveal a stellar stream aligned along the polar axis,
alongside other signatures of tidal interaction, including a flat, tilted LSB
envelope that extends toward the neighboring galaxy MCG +04-37-035, with which
UGC 10043 is connected by an HI bridge. Our results suggest that the polar
component of UGC 10043 comprises and older, triaxial polar bulge and a younger,
forming polar structure, likely originating from the ongoing disruption of a
dwarf satellite galaxy, while also participating in active interaction with MCG
+04-37-035.

**TL;DR**: 通过[S II]和[O II]发射线比率估算星系中电子密度，并利用MaNGA巡天的IFU光谱数据绘制其空间分布，为星系磁场研究提供新见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 目前对星系尺度磁场的研究依赖于热电子密度的估计及其径向变化，但星际介质中电子的空间分布尚不明确。

Data: 使用了SDSS MaNGA巡天的积分视场单元（IFU）光谱观测数据，包括Pipe3D和MaNGA DAP的数据产品。

Method: 通过[S II]和[O II]碰撞激发双线发射线比率估算电子密度，并采用线性和非线性分箱方案获取径向分布。

Result: 研究发现，无论是恒星形成星系还是非恒星形成星系，电子密度在星系内盘区域较高（165.6 ± 20.8 cm^-3），在外盘区域较低（31 ± 4.5 cm^-3），这些结果为星系磁场研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Most observational studies of galactic-scale magnetic fields using Faraday
rotation rely on estimates of thermal electron densities in galaxies and their
radial variations. However, the spatial distribution of electrons in the
interstellar medium (ISM) is not clearly known. In this study, we propose and
utilize collision-excited doublet emission line ratios of [S\,\textsc{ii}]
$\lambda\lambda$ 6716, 6731 \AA~and [O\,\textsc{ii}] $\lambda\lambda$ 3726,
3729 \AA \ to estimate the electron densities ($n_e$). To map their
distribution in the galaxies, we employ Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectroscopic
observations from the SDSS Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory
(MaNGA) survey, utilising data products from both the \texttt{Pipe3D} and MaNGA
Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP). We present a spatially resolved analysis of $13$
face-on galaxies (inclination, $i \leq 10^\circ$), including $9$ star-forming
galaxies (SFGs) and $4$ Non-SFGs. Azimuthally averaged radial profiles of $n_e$
are obtained using two different binning schemes: linear and non-linear. For
the \texttt{Pipe3D} case, both SFGs and non-SFGs exhibit $n_e$ gradients, with
higher densities of $n_e$(S\,\textsc{ii}) = $165.6 \pm 20.8$ cm$^{-3}$ in the
inner disk region (r/R$_e$ $\leq$ 1.5), which decrease to $31 \pm 4.5$
cm$^{-3}$ in the outer disk region (r/R$_e$ $>$ 1.5). We also translate $n_e$
to the electron column density $N_e$ assuming an evenly distributed thin disk
profile, fairly excluding the central bulge regions. These electron density
estimates at different radii provide valuable insights for resolving
ambiguities in current and future studies of magnetic fields in galaxies.

**TL;DR**: 研究22个近邻侧向螺旋星系中射电连续谱尺度高度与恒星形成率等星系基本性质的关系，发现厚气体盘部分由宇宙射线压力支撑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 侧向螺旋星系提供了研究射电晕的独特视角，射电晕由宇宙射线电子在磁场中产生同步辐射形成。研究旨在探讨射电晕的起源及宇宙射线在支撑气体盘中的作用，并测试恒星形成作为宇宙射线主要来源的影响。

Data: 来自CHANG-ES巡天的22个近邻侧向螺旋星系的射电连续谱数据，使用Jansky甚大阵在S波段（2-4 GHz）的深观测，成像角分辨率为7"。

Method: 在有效射电连续谱半径内的三个条带中测量尺度高度，校正角分辨率和倾角的影响，仅选择至少在一个条带中能区分薄盘和厚盘的星系。

Result: 发现薄盘和厚盘的尺度高度与恒星形成半径及恒星形成率（SFR）呈强正相关，与质量面密度和SFR与质量面密度的比值呈中等强度相关，但与SFR面密度单独无关；高SFR面密度的星系形状较圆，而恒星形成较少的星系垂直延伸相对较小。

Abstract: Context. Edge-on spiral galaxies give us an outsiders' view of the radio
halo, which envelops these galaxies. The radio halos are caused by extra-planar
cosmic-ray electrons that emit synchrotron emission in magnetic fields. Aims.
We aim to study the origin of radio halos around galaxies and infer the role of
cosmic-rays in supporting the gaseous discs. We would like to test the
influence of star formation as the main source of cosmic rays as well as other
fundamental galaxy properties such as mass and size. Methods. We present a
study of radio continuum scale heights in 22 nearby edge-on galaxies from the
CHANG-ES survey. We employ deep observations with the Jansky Very Large Array
in the S-band (2-4 GHz), imaging at 7" angular resolution. We measure scale
heights in three strips within the effective radio continuum radius, correcting
for the influence of angular resolution and inclination angle. We include only
galaxies where a distinction between the two disc components can be made in at
least one of the strips, providing us with robust measurements of both scale
heights. Results. We find a strong positive correlation between scale heights
of the thin and thick discs and star-forming radius as well as star-formation
rate (SFR); moderately strong correlations are found for the mass surface
density and the ratio of SFR-to-mass surface density; no correlation is found
with SFR surface density alone. Yet the SFR surface density plays a role as
well: galaxies with high SFR surface densities have a rather roundish shape,
whereas galaxies with little star formation show only a relatively small
vertical extent in comparison to their size. Conclusions. Thick gaseous discs
are partially supported by cosmic-ray pressure. Our results are a useful
benchmark for simulations of galaxy evolution that include cosmic rays.

Background: 外银河系高分辨率巡天（OGHReS）覆盖了180度到280度的100平方度区域，研究CO同位素谱线以改进分子云团的性质。

Data: 使用了OGHReS区域的CO同位素谱线数据，分析了6706个分子云团。

Method: 通过分析CO同位素谱线，改进了分子云团的速度和物理性质。

Result: 研究发现：1）分子云团与螺旋臂轨迹的相关性提高，并发现外臂以外的新螺旋结构；2）L/M比下降趋势表明外银河系高质量恒星形成较少；3）恒星形成比例增加；4）不同巡天间的速度分配差异可能影响约10000个分子云团。

Abstract: The Outer Galaxy High-Resolution Survey (OGHReS) covers 100 square degrees
($180^\circ < \ell < 280^\circ$) in the (2--1) transitions of three
CO-isotopologues. We use the spectra to refine the velocities and physical
properties to 6706 \higal\ clumps located in the OGHReS region. In a previous
paper, we analysed 3584 clumps between $\ell = 250^\circ$ and $280^\circ$.
Here, we cover a further 3122 clumps ($180^\circ < \ell < 250^\circ$) and
determine reliable velocities for \withVLSR\ of these, finding good agreement
with the previously assigned velocities ($\sim$80 percent within 5 \kms). We
update velocities for 288 clumps and provide new values for an additional 411.
Combining these with the previous results, we have velocities and physical
properties for 6193 clumps (92.3 percent). The \allnonDetections\
non-detections are low surface density clumps or likely contamination by
evolved stars and galaxies. Key findings: i) improved correlation between
clumps and spiral arm loci, and the discovery of clumps beyond the outer arm
supports the existence of a new spiral structure; ii) decreasing trend in the
$L/M$-ratio consistent with less high-mass star formation in the outer Galaxy;
iii) increase in the star formation fraction (SFF) in the outer Galaxy,
suggesting that more clumps are forming stars despite their lower mass; iv)
discrepancies in velocity assignments across different surveys that could
affect $\sim$10000 clumps, especially in the fourth quadrant.

Background: 目前对星系中尘埃的量化方法存在局限性，巴尔默减幅和尘埃质量分别探测尘埃的不同方面，但二者之间没有明确的关联。

Data: 使用了多个波段的恒星形成率敏感光度数据，包括紫外、Hα和远红外。

Method: 通过结合巴尔默减幅和尘埃质量信息，提出了两个新的参数，用于量化星系中的尘埃几何结构。

Result: 新参数对尘埃几何结构敏感，支持星暴星系中尘埃的“最大前景屏幕”模型，并展示了这些参数随星系质量、恒星形成率和特定恒星形成率的变化。

Abstract: We introduce a new approach to quantifying dust in galaxies by combining
information from the Balmer decrement (BD) and the dust mass ($M_d$). While
there is no explicit correlation between these two properties, they jointly
probe different aspects of the dust present in galaxies. We explore two new
parameters that link BD with $M_d$ by using star formation rate sensitive
luminosities at several wavelengths (ultraviolet, H$\alpha$, and far-infrared).
This analysis shows that combining the BD and $M_d$ in these ways provides new
metrics that are sensitive to the degree of optically thick dust affecting the
short wavelength emission. We show how these new ''dust geometry'' parameters
vary as a function of galaxy mass, star formation rate, and specific star
formation rate. We demonstrate that they are sensitive probes of the dust
geometry in galaxies, and that they support the ''maximal foreground screen''
model for dust in starburst galaxies.

Background: 高质量端初始质量函数（IMF）的研究因样本稀缺而受限，LAMOST作为高效的光谱望远镜为相关研究提供了新机会。

Data: 使用了LAMOST巡天的约70,000颗早型主序星数据。

Method: 通过校正观测样本的选择效应、恒星演化和未分辨双星的影响，使用双星演化代码同时校正这些效应，并探讨了双星质量比分布和银河系恒星形成历史对IMF的影响。

Result: 初始质量函数的斜率αini为2.70-2.82，且发现αini可能随空间尺度增大而减小，可能与金属丰度变化有关。

Abstract: Research on the high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF) has been
limited due to a scarcity of samples. Recently, Large Sky Area Multi-Object
Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST), as the most efficient spectroscopic
telescope, has provided new opportunities for related research. In this study,
based on approximately 70,000 main-sequence early-type stars from the LAMOST
survey, we investigated the IMF of Galactic field stars at the high-mass end
(1.5 < M/Msun < 7.1). First, we derived the slope of the present-day mass
function (PDMF), finding after correcting for selection effect in the observed
sample. We then accounted for the effects of stellar evolution and unresolved
binaries to correct the PDMF back to the IMF, resulting in {\alpha}ini = 2.70 -
2.82. Notably, we corrected both stellar evolution and unresolved binary
effects simultaneously by using binary-Star evolution code, which enhances the
robustness of our results. Additionally, we investigated how different
mass-ratio (q) distributions of binaries and different star formation histories
of the Milky Way impact the IMF. Finally, we tested samples across different
spatial scales and found that {\alpha}ini may exhibit a decreasing trend as the
spatial scale increases, which could be attributed to variations in
metallicity.

**TL;DR**: 通过WALLABY调查的初步观测，研究了995个本地富含气体的星系中恒星主导区域内原子氢（HI）质量的变化因素，发现HI质量比例与恒星性质相关，且内区HI表面密度与星系颜色有显著关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 全球原子氢（HI）比例关系的分散性部分归因于HI和恒星性质测量方式的差异，HI通常延伸到星系内部恒星形成区域之外。

Data: 使用了WALLABY调查的初步观测数据，涵盖995个本地富含气体的星系。

Method: 通过限制测量范围到R25和R24（i波段25和24 mag arcsec^-2的等照度半径），研究了HI质量比例和表面密度与其他星系性质的相关性。

Result: 平均68%的HI质量位于R25内，54%位于R24内；HI质量比例与恒星质量、表面密度和颜色有轻度相关性，而内区HI表面密度与光学颜色有显著关联，蓝色星系的内区HI表面密度更高。

Abstract: The scatter in global atomic hydrogen (HI) scaling relations is partly
attributed to differences in how HI and stellar properties are measured, with
HI reservoirs typically extending beyond the inner regions of galaxies where
star formation occurs. Using pilot observations from the WALLABY survey, we
present the first measurements of HI mass enclosed within the stellar-dominated
regions of galaxies for a statistical sample of 995 local gas-rich systems,
investigating the factors driving its variation. We examine how global HI
scaling relations change when measurements are restricted to R25 and R24 -- the
isophotal radii at 25 and 24 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in the i-band -- and explore how
the fraction of HI mass and HI surface density within these radii correlate
with other galaxy properties. On average, 68% of the total HI mass is enclosed
within R25 and 54% within R24, though significant variation exists between
galaxies. The fraction of HI mass within R25 shows a mild correlation with
stellar properties, with galaxies of higher stellar mass, greater stellar
surface density, or redder colours enclosing a larger fraction of their HI
reservoirs. These correlations do not significantly strengthen when considering
R24. Conversely, global HI surface densities show no significant correlation
with stellar mass or stellar surface density, but trends start emerging when
these are measured within the inner regions of galaxies. The strongest
correlation is observed with optical colour, with bluer galaxies having higher
average HI surface densities within R25. This trend strengthens when we
restrict from R25 to R24, suggesting a closer connection between inner HI
reservoirs and star formation. This study underscores the value of (at least
marginally) resolved HI surveys of statistical samples for advancing our
understanding of the gas-star formation cycle in galaxies. [Abriged]

Background: 当前研究旨在通过提高恒星速度弥散度的测量精度，支持时间延迟宇宙学的研究，同时验证透镜星系的质量基本平面关系。现有研究在系统误差和样本协方差方面存在不足。

Data: 使用了SL2S透镜星系巡天的光谱数据，特别是信噪比（SNR）大于20/埃的光谱。

Method: 采用了严格的信噪比筛选标准，并运用新开发的方法减少和量化模板库和拟合过程中的系统误差，同时量化样本间的协方差。

Result: 新的测量结果显示平均随机不确定度为3-4%，系统不确定度为2%，样本间协方差为1%。验证了SL2S样本、TDCOSMO时间延迟透镜样本和低红移SLACS样本在质量基本平面上的相关性，并首次推导了自由幂律质量密度分布假设下的质量基本平面。

Abstract: We reanalyze spectra taken as part of the SL2S lens galaxy survey, with the
goal to obtain stellar velocity dispersion with precision and accuracy
sufficient for time-delay cosmography. In order to achieve this goal, we impose
stringent cuts on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and employ recently developed
methods to mitigate and quantify residual systematic errors due to template
libraries and fitting process. We also quantify the covariance across the
sample. For galaxies with spectra with SNR > 20/{\AA}, our new measurements
have average random uncertainty of 3-4%, average systematic uncertainty of 2%,
and covariance across the sample of 1%. We find negligible covariance between
spectra taken with different instruments. The systematic uncertainty and
covariance need to be included when the sample is used as an external dataset
in time-delay cosmography. We revisit empirical scaling relations of lens
galaxies based on the improved kinematics. We show that the SLS2 sample, the
TDCOSMO time-delay lens sample, and the lower redshift SLACS sample follow the
same correlation between effective radius, stellar velocity dispersion and
lensing mass, known as the lensing mass fundamental plane, as that derived by
Auger et al. (2010) assuming isothermal mass profiles for the deflectors. We
also derive for the first time the lensing mass fundamental plane assuming free
power-law mass density profiles, and show that the three samples also follow
the same correlation. This is consistent with a scenario in which massive
galaxies evolve by growing their radii and mass, but staying within the plane.

Abstract: Slitless spectroscopy is a traditional method for selecting quasars. In this
paper, we develop a procedure for selecting quasars (QSOs) using the 3D-HST
G141 slitless spectra. We initially identify over 6,000 sources with emission
lines broader than those typically found in emission line galaxies (ELGs) by
analyzing the 1D spectra. These ``broad'' emission lines may originate from
actual QSO broad lines ($\rm FWHM\geq1200~\rm km/s$) or the convolved narrow
lines ($\rm FWHM = 200\sim 300\rm km/s$) in ELGs with effective radii
$\geq$0.3" (2.5Kpc at z=1). We then propose a criterion based on the
reliability of the QSO component in the forward modeling results. Using the
known QSOs, ELGs, and simulation spectra, we find that our criterion
successfully selects about 90\% of known QSOs with H$\alpha$ or H$\beta$ line
detection and point-like structures, with an ELG contamination rate of about
5\%. We apply this method to emission line sources without significant
contamination and select 19 QSO candidates at redshift $z=0.12-1.56$. 12 of
these candidates have Chandra X-ray detections. This sample covers a broader
range of the rest-frame UV colors and has redder optical slopes compared to the
SDSS QSOs, yet it is more likely to be composed of normal QSOs rather than
little red dots. Through spectral analysis, the estimated black hole masses of
the sample are $10^{6.9}-10^{8.3} M_{\odot}$. Our new candidates improve the
completeness of the QSO sample at $z=0.8-1.6$ in the 3D-HST field. The proposed
method will also be helpful for QSO selections via slitless spectroscopy in
Euclid and the Chinese Space Station Telescope.

Abstract: Magnetic fields play a significant role in star-forming processes on core to
clump scales. We investigate magnetic field orientations and strengths in the
massive star-forming clump P2 within the filamentary infrared dark cloud
G28.34+0.06 using dust polarization observations made using SCUBA-2/POL-2 on
the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope as part of the B-field In STar-forming Region
Observations (BISTRO) survey. We compare the magnetic field orientations at the
clump scale of ~2 parsecs from these JCMT observations with those at the core
scale of ~0.2 parsecs from archival ALMA data, finding that the magnetic field
orientations on these two different scales are perpendicular to one another. We
estimate the distribution of magnetic field strengths, which range from 50 to
430 {\mu}G over the clump. The region forming the core shows the highest
magnetic field strength. We also obtain the distribution of mass-to-flux ratios
across the clump. In the region surrounding the core, the mass-to-flux ratio is
larger than 1, which indicates the magnetic field strength is insufficient to
support the region against gravitational collapse. Therefore, the change in the
magnetic field orientation from clump to core scales may be the result of
gravitational collapse, with the field being pulled inward along with the flow
of material under gravity.

Abstract: Deep imaging surveys have changed our view of the low surface brightness
(LSB) Universe. The "renaissance" of the low surface brightness dwarf galaxy
population, as the prime example of such recent development, continues to
challenge our understanding of galaxy formation. Here, We report the
serendipitous discovery of Zangetsu, an isolated, quiescent, and distorted
ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) candidate in the COSMOS field, using images from the
Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Zangetsu exhibits an
extremely low central surface brightness ($\mathrm{\mu_{0,g}}=26.60\pm0.01$ mag
arcsec$^{-2}$), a very shallow inner surface brightness profile
($\mathrm{n}_{\rm Sersic}=0.40\pm0.01$), and a large angular size
($\mathrm{R_e}\approx 10.44$ arcsec). Surprisingly, Zangetsu also has a
quiescent stellar population ($\mathrm{g-i}=0.96$), an unusually elongated
shape ($\mathrm{b/a}\sim 0.25$), and mild morphological asymmetry, making it a
rare case among known UDGs. Surface brightness fluctuation analysis of HSC and
Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images only provides a distance lower limit of
$D>25.4$ Mpc (thus $\mathrm{R_e}>1.38$ kpc). However, Zangetsu remains an
extreme outlier in the luminosity-size relation of known LSB galaxies,
suggesting that it could be an exceptionally large and/or diffuse system.
Classic internal or external UDG formation mechanisms alone struggle to explain
such a system. A backsplash origin may account for its isolation and quiescent
nature. This finding also raises the possibility that current works may
overlook similarly extreme, elongated systems that could further our
understanding of the LSB Universe.

galaxies is determined, as well as the distributions of dark matter masses,

**TL;DR**: 利用JWST/NIRSpec的积分场光谱数据，通过两种独立方法精确测量了NGC 4486B中超大质量黑洞的质量，发现其质量略低于但更精确于先前估计，并支持该星系是潮汐剥离残余核心的解释。

Background: 紧凑椭圆星系NGC 4486B中的超大质量黑洞（SMBH）质量此前已有估计，但精度不足，且星系的双核结构和非平衡状态未被充分研究。

Data: JWST/NIRSpec的积分场光谱数据和地面长缝光谱数据。

Method: 使用Schwarzschild轨道叠加法和Jeans各向异性模型两种独立方法拟合视线速度分布。

Result: 测得黑洞质量为3.6正负0.6乘以10的8次方太阳质量，占恒星总质量的4-13%，支持NGC 4486B是潮汐剥离残余核心的解释；暗物质含量上限为恒星质量的50%。

Abstract: We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole
(SMBH) in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC 4486B, based on integral field
spectroscopy with JWST/NIRSpec. The two-dimensional kinematic maps reveal a
resolved double nucleus and a velocity dispersion peak offset from the
photometric center. Utilizing two independent methods-Schwarzschild
orbit-superposition and Jeans Anisotropic Modeling-we tightly constrain the
black hole mass by fitting the full line-of-sight velocity distribution. Our
axisymmetric Schwarzschild models yield a best-fit black hole mass of $M_{BH} =
3.6^{+0.6}_{-0.6} \times 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$, slightly lower but significantly
more precise than previous estimates. However, since our models do not account
for the non-equilibrium nature of the double nucleus, this value may represent
a lower limit. The inferred black hole mass corresponds to approximately 4-13%
of the total stellar mass, providing robust evidence for an overmassive SMBH in
NGC 4486B. Combined with the galaxy's location deep within the Virgo Cluster,
our results support the interpretation that NGC 4486B is the tidally stripped
remnant core of a formerly massive galaxy. As the JWST/NIRSpec field of view is
insufficient to constrain the dark matter halo, we incorporate archival
ground-based long-slit kinematics extending to 5 arcsec. While this provides
some leverage on the dark matter content, the constraints remain relatively
weak. We place only an upper limit on the dark matter fraction, with
$M_{DM}/M_{*} < 0.5$ within 1 kpc-well beyond the effective radius. The
inferred black hole mass remains unchanged with or without a dark matter halo.

**TL;DR**: 利用机器学习方法对贫金属恒星进行分类，揭示其核合成过程起源，并发现该方法与传统分类的一致性为87%，同时指出部分恒星可能需要重新分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 贫金属恒星的核合成过程（如快中子捕获过程（r过程）、慢中子捕获过程（s过程）和中间过程（i过程））的分类是研究恒星化学演化的重要课题。现有研究在分类上存在一定局限性，而机器学习方法为这一问题提供了新的解决路径。

Data: 研究使用了基于流体动力学模拟的核合成计算数据，包括中子星合并等事件中的r过程数据、s过程模拟数据以及少量i过程数据。

Method: 通过训练机器学习模型，对贫金属恒星的核合成过程进行分类，并与传统分类方法进行比较。

Result: 机器学习模型在区分r过程和s过程上表现良好，与传统分类的一致性达到87%，同时发现部分i过程恒星可能属于r或s过程起源，而部分s过程恒星可能更符合i过程特征。

Abstract: We apply the capabilities of machine learning (ML) to discern patterns in
order to classify metal-poor stars. To do so, we train an ML model on a bank of
nucleosynthesis calculations derived from hydrodynamic simulations for events
such as neutron star mergers where the rapid ($r$) neutron capture process can
take place. Likewise we consider a bank of calculations from simulations of the
slow ($s$) neutron capture process and also consider a few calculations for the
intermediate ($i$) neutron capture process. We demonstrate that the ML does
well overall in recognizing the $s$ process from the $r$ process, and after
training on theoretical calculations ML stellar assignments match conventional
labels 87% of the time. We highlight that this method then points to stars that
could benefit from additional observational measurements. We also demonstrate
that the ML assigns some of the presently considered $i$-process stars to
instead be of $r$ or $s$ in origin, but likewise, finds stars currently labeled
as $s$ to be potentially more aligned with $i$ enrichment. This first
application of ML to classify metal-poor star enrichment using theoretical
nucleosynthesis calculations thus reveals the promise, and some challenges,
associated with this new data-driven path forward.

Result: 研究结果表明恒星风模型可能解释WS 35的高速流动，并提出了未来射电观测验证球形风场景的方法。

Abstract: We present theoretical arguments toward the plausibility of a stellar wind}to
explain the 16000\,km\,$s^{-1}$ line broadening in the optical spectra of WS
35, the central star in the Pa 30 nebula. The wind model is discussed in the
context of super-Eddington flows. We argue that WS 35 potentially occupies a
new regime of wind driving theory as the first metal-only wind. While this
framework provides a promising avenue for explaining the high speed flow,
questions remain about the source's true nature. We further describe how future
radio observations can provide an independent test of the spherical wind
scenario. A magnetically channeled wind would likely produce a relatively flat
and bright radio spectral energy distributions. By contrast a spherical wind
should result in a thermal radio spectrum with a canonical continuum slope of
$\nu^{0.6}$, and a brightness level consistent with the currently predicted
mass-loss rate.

Data: 使用了干涉测量数据、IUE光谱数据、Gaia自行运动异常数据以及MK标准恒星的紫外温度数据。

Method: 采用干涉测量法确定轨道，通过IUE光谱和与Detached Eclipsing Binaries的质量-温度关系确定伴星质量，并结合单线光谱轨道、Gaia自行运动异常和紫外数据确定造父变星质量。

Result: 确定了造父变星的质量为4.7 ± 0.8 M⊙，伴星质量为2.6 ± 0.2 M⊙，并讨论了不同质量确定方法的不确定性，预计Gaia DR4发布后将减少这些不确定性。

Abstract: The system V350 Sgr has a classical Cepheid for the primary. Interferometry
is presented for the system and the full orbit is determined. The mass of the
companion has been determined from an {\it IUE} spectrum and comparison with
the mass-temperature relation from Detached Eclipsing Binaries. Combined with
the mass of the companion (2.6 $\pm$ 0.2 M$_\odot$), the mass of the Cepheid is
determined to be 4.7 $\pm$ 0.8 M$_\odot$. For systems with less complete
information, Cepheid masses can be determined from a single-lined spectroscopic
orbit, {\it Gaia} proper motion anomalies, and the mass of the companion from
the ultraviolet. Uncertainties resulting from different approaches to mass
determination are discussed, and are expected to be reduced after the {\it
Gaia} DR4 release. Temperatures for Morgan Keenan (MK) standard stars from the
ultraviolet are also provided.

<details>

Background: 可靠的恒星大气参数对于研究恒星结构和演化以及恒星群体研究至关重要，但不同地面光谱调查之间存在偏差。

Data: 使用了Gaia DR3、LAMOST DR11、APOGEE DR17和GALAH DR4的数据。

Result: 发现F、G和K型星的参数偏差小于B、A和M型星，且Teff的分散随温度降低而减小，而logg的分散则相反。

Abstract: Reliable stellar atmospheric parameters are essential for probing stellar
structure and evolution, and for stellar population studies. However, various
deviations appear in comparisons with different ground-based spectroscopic
surveys. We aim to select high-quality open cluster members and employ the
atmospheric parameters provided by the theoretical isochrones of open clusters
as a benchmark to assess the quality of stellar atmospheric parameters from
Gaia DR3 and other ground-based spectroscopic surveys, such as LAMOST DR11,
APOGEE DR17, and GALAH DR4. We selected 130 open clusters with well-defined
main sequences within 500 pc of the solar neighborhood as a benchmark sample to
estimate the reference atmospheric parameters of the members from the best-fit
isochrones of those clusters. By comparing the atmospheric parameters provided
by different spectroscopic surveys to the theoretical parameters, we found that
the atmospheric parameter deviation and the corresponding dispersions exhibit
different variations. The atmospheric parameter deviations of F, G, and K-type
stars are smaller than those of B, A, and M-type stars for most surveys. For
most samples, the dispersion of Teff decreases as temperature decreases,
whereas the dispersion of logg shows the opposite trend.

Abstract: Water is detected in environments representing every stage of star and solar
system formation, but its chemical evolution throughout these stages remains
poorly constrained. Deuterium ratios offer a means of probing chemical links
between water in different cosmic regions because of their sensitivity to
physicochemical conditions. Here, we present the first detection of the 4.1
$\mu$m HDO ice feature with JWST toward L1527 IRS, an isolated low-mass
protostar that may eventually grow to a sun-like mass. We measure an ice
HDO/H$_{2}$O ratio of 4.4$^{+3.7}_{-1.7}$$\times$10$^{-3}$, where the reported
error is dominated by uncertainties in continuum definition and ice band
strengths. This fraction is similar to the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured in
the warm ($>$100 K) inner cores of other low-mass protostellar envelopes and
protoplanetary disks found in comparably isolated star-forming regions. Such a
similarity tentatively supports the assumption that water vapor detected in
these regions is not significantly altered by gas-phase reactions following ice
sublimation. It also supports the hypothesis that pre- and protostellar water
ice is largely inherited in a chemically unaltered state by outer
protoplanetary disks. However, the fraction is a factor of $\sim$4-10 times
higher than the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured toward comets and low-mass
protostars in clustered star-forming regions. This difference may be due to
either gas-phase water reprocessing in protostellar envelopes and
protoplanetary disks, or differences between prestellar conditions of isolated
dense cores and the clustered star-forming regions that are more analogous to
the environment in which our Sun formed.

**TL;DR**: 通过理论和N体模拟研究，太阳在形成后约20百万年内离开其诞生星团，这一过程解释了奥尔特云的质量，并表明太阳系外部的动力学特征仍保留着星团环境的痕迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 太阳诞生于一个包含约10,000颗恒星的星团环境中，如今作为孤立恒星，其离开星团的时间、方式及其对太阳系外部结构的影响尚不明确。奥尔特云的质量和轨道分布对太阳在星团中的动力学过程敏感。

Data: 奥尔特云的质量（0.2至2.0地球质量）和轨道分布数据。

Method: 结合理论分析和N体模拟方法。

Result: 研究表明，太阳在形成后约20百万年内离开星团，这一时间点解释了奥尔特云的质量，并表明太阳系外部的动力学特征仍保留着星团环境的痕迹。未来发现低偏心率的内部奥尔特云天体将提供更强约束。

Abstract: The Sun was born in a clustered environment with 10,000 other stars. Being an
isolated star today, the Sun must have left the nest. We do not directly know
when that happened, how violent the ejection was, or how far the Solar siblings
have drifted apart. The mass of the fragile outer Opic-Oort cloud, (between
$r_{\rm inner} \sim 30,000$\,au and $200\,000$au from the Sun) and the orbital
distribution of planetesimals in the inner Hills-Oort cloud (between $\sim
1000$\,au and $\sim 30\,000$ au) are sensitive to the dynamical processes
involving the Sun in the parent cluster. We aim at understanding the extend to
which observing the Oort cloud constrains the Sun's birth environment. This is
achieved by a combination of theoretical arguments and N-body simulations. We
show that the current mass of the Opic-Oort cloud (between 0.2 and $2.0$ Earth
masses) is best explained if the Sun left the nest within $\sim 20$\,Myr after
the giant planets formed and migrated. As a consequence, the possible dynamical
encounter with another star carving the Kuiper belt, the Sun's abduction of
Sedna, and other perturbations induced by nearby stars then must have happened
shortly after the giant planets in the Solar system formed, but before the Sun
left the parent cluster. Signatures of the time spend in the parent cluster
must still be visible in the outer parts of the Solar system today. The
strongest constraints will be the discovery of a population of relatively
low-eccentricity ($e < 0.9$) inner Oort-cloud (but $500 < a < 10^4$\,au)
objects.

**TL;DR**: 该研究提出了一种混合模拟推理框架（HySBI），结合小尺度模拟推理和大尺度扰动理论，显著提高了对宇宙学参数的约束精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 模拟推理（SBI）已成为从星系巡天中提取非线性宇宙学信息的有力工具，但其应用受限于大规模模拟的计算成本。

Data: 研究使用了高分辨率观测数据，结合小尺度和大尺度的统计信息。

Method: 采用了混合模拟推理框架（HySBI），结合小尺度模拟推理和大尺度扰动理论（PT），并研究了星系建模参数的先验选择及其宇宙学依赖性。

Result: HySBI框架相比传统扰动理论分析，对Ωm和σ8的约束精度分别提高了20%和60%，证明了该方法在最大化提取未来光谱数据集信息方面的有效性。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) has emerged as a powerful tool for
extracting cosmological information from galaxy surveys deep into the
non-linear regime. Despite its great promise, its application is limited by the
computational cost of running simulations that can describe the
increasingly-large cosmological datasets. Recent work proposed a hybrid SBI
framework (HySBI), which combines SBI on small-scales with perturbation theory
(PT) on large-scales, allowing information to be extracted from high-resolution
observations without large-volume simulations. In this work, we lay out the
HySBI framework for galaxy clustering, a key step towards its application to
next-generation datasets. We study the choice of priors on the parameters for
modeling galaxies in PT analysis and in simulation-based analyses, as well as
investigate their cosmology dependence. By jointly modeling large- and
small-scale statistics and their associated nuisance parameters, we show that
HySBI can obtain 20\% and 60\% tighter constraints on $\Omega_m$ and
$\sigma_8$, respectively, compared to traditional PT analyses, thus
demonstrating the efficacy of this approach to maximally extract information
from upcoming spectroscopic datasets.

Background: 阻尼莱曼α吸收体（DLA）的H~{\sc i}气体分布因背景类星体的点源特性而难以研究，而利用背景扩展星系观测为研究其尺寸和结构提供了新方法。

Data: 使用Keck Cosmic Web Imager观测了一个位于z=3.34的DLA，其背景星系位于z=3.61。

Method: 通过背景扩展星系的光谱分析，首次捕捉到DLA的“剪影”图像，并检测了其内部结构和周围环境。

Result: DLA的剪影图像虽未完全解析，但证明了利用扩展背景源研究DLA形态的可行性；发现DLA可能存在于星系群或原星系团环境中，并检测到可能的金属富集外流或高恒星形成活动星系。

Abstract: The H~{\sc i} gas distribution in damped Lyman $\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) has
remained elusive due to the point-source nature of background quasar emission.
Observing DLAs against spatially extended background galaxies provides a new
method for constraining their size and structure. Using the Keck Cosmic Web
Imager, we present the first ``silhouette'' image of a DLA at $z=3.34$,
identified in the spectrum of a background galaxy at $z=3.61$. Although the
silhouette remains unresolved due to limited spatial resolution, this
represents a successful proof-of-concept for studying DLA morphology using
extended background sources. Possible residual emission in the DLA trough
suggests an optical depth contrast exceeding $10^7$ in the internal structure,
implying a sharp edge or patchy structure. A Lyman $\alpha$ emitter (LAE) at
$z_{\rm LAE}=3.3433\pm0.0005$, consistent with the DLA redshift, is detected at
an angular separation of $1.''73\pm0.''28$ ($12.9\pm2.1$ kpc). The DLA is
surrounded by three galaxies within 140 kpc in projected distance and 500 km
s$^{-1}$ in line-of-sight velocity, indicating that it resides in the
circumgalactic medium of the LAE or within a galaxy group/protocluster
environment. An O~{\sc i} $\lambda1302$ absorption at $z_{\rm
OI}=3.3288\pm0.0004$ is also detected along the line of sight. This absorber
may trace metal-enriched outflow from the LAE or a gas-rich galaxy exhibiting
the highest star formation activity among the surrounding galaxies. Future
large spectroscopic surveys of galaxies will expand such a DLA sample, and
three-dimensional spectroscopy for it will shed new light on the role of
intergalactic dense gas in galaxy formation and evolution.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Abstract: Up to 40% of galaxies in the local universe host a low-luminosity active
galactic nucleus (LLAGN), making it vital to understand this mode of black hole
accretion. However, the presence or absence of Seyfert-like geometries - an
accretion disk close to the black hole, an optical broad line region (BLR), and
a molecular torus - remains uncertain owing to the low flux levels of sources
within this class. Herein, we present an analysis of a XRISM/Resolve spectrum
of M81*, the LLAGN in the heart of the nearby spiral galaxy M81. A weak,
neutral Fe K emission line is detected and resolved into K$_{\alpha,1}$ and
K$_{\alpha,2}$ components. It shows a negligible velocity shift, and weak
broadening (FWHM$=460^{+260}_{-160}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$) that corresponds to
an inner emission radius of ${\rm r} \geq 2.7\times 10^{4}~GM/c^{2}$ for likely
inclinations. The Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line likely traces a torus. The upper limit
on additional splitting of the Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line components translates to a
limit on the local magnetic field of ${\rm B} \leq 3.5\times 10^{8}$ Gauss,
assuming Zeeman splitting. The spectra also reveal ionized plasma(s) through
He-like Fe XXV and H-like Fe XXVI emission lines. These can be fit equally well
assuming photoionization and collisional excitation. The H-like Fe XXVI line is
better described when a second component is included with a red-shift of ${\rm
v} = 1600~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$, but this addition is of marginal statistical
significance. We discuss these results in the context of radiatively
inefficient accretion flow models, magnetically arrested disks, and possible
links to the Fermi bubbles in the Milky Way.

*Yu-Sik Kim,Jae-Young Kim*

**TL;DR**: The study uses VLBI observations of blazar PKS 0735+178 to investigate its temporal and structural changes around the time of a high-energy neutrino event, suggesting a probable spatial origin for the neutrino emission.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Recent studies suggest blazars as plausible sources of high-energy neutrinos, but degeneracies in models persist due to lack of high-resolution observations pinpointing neutrino-emitting plasma locations.

Data: Publicly available VLBA 15 and 43 GHz data of PKS 0735+178 from 2020-2024.

Method: VLBI study analyzing flux density, brightness temperature, synchrotron opacity, and jet structure evolution before and after the neutrino event IC211208.

Result: Significant enhancements in radio flux density and brightness temperature post-IC211208, along with the ejection of a new VLBI component, suggest a probable spatial origin for the neutrino event near a subluminally moving jet feature.

Abstract: Recent studies of individual track-like TeV-PeV IceCube neutrino events
suggest that strongly jetted AGNs, blazars, can be plausible sources of
extragalactic high-energy neutrinos. Although the broadband emission and
neutrinos from such blazars can be modeled by hadronic jets with inverse
Compton processes, various models show degeneracies. One of the reasons is the
lack of high-resolution observations pinpointing the location and physical
conditions of neutrino-emitting plasma. Here, we present a VLBI study of PKS
0735+178 that was recently associated with a high energy neutrino event
IceCube-211208A (IC211208) as well as alerts from other neutrino observatories.
We analyzed publicly available VLBA 15 and 43 GHz data of 0735+178 during
2020-2024, resolving the mas-scale jet and tracing its time evolution in flux
and structure, before and after IC211208. We find significant enhancements in
the radio flux density, apparent brightness temperature, and synchrotron
opacity at 15-43 GHz of the VLBI nuclear region after IC211208, strengthening
the temporal correlation between 0735+178 and IC211208. Furthermore, we find
that the source ejected a new VLBI component C2 from the VLBI core before
IC211208. C2 traveled further downstream at ~4.2c apparent speed, close to the
historical maximum speed for this object. C2 then passed a subluminally moving
feature in the jet C1 located at ~0.13 mas (~0.77 pc) downstream the core at
the time of IC211208. The time of this apparent passage is statistically
coincident with the time of IC211208 within 1sigma uncertainty, suggesting the
location of this apparent passage to be a probable spatial origin of IC211208.
We discuss the physical implications of these findings.
