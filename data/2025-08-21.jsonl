A popular explanation is that they are a sub-population\nof active galactic nuclei/supermassive black holes (AGN/SMBHs) predominantly\nfound in the high-redshift Universe ($z\\gtrsim3$). Similarly, direct collapse\nblack holes (DCBHs), theorized to form from collapsing massive, extremely\nmetal-poor gas clouds, have been invoked to explain high-redshift quasars, the\nmost massive AGN sub-population. Here, we employ the semi-analytical code\nA-SLOTH to produce a population of DCBHs and compare them against observed LRD\ndemographics and properties. Specifically, we compare the DCBH-seeded SMBH\npopulation against the standard stellar-remnant seeds and find that DCBH models\nagree better with observed LRD population statistics and host halo properties.\nFurthermore, for the most extreme and earliest LRD detections, interpreted to\nbe systems with an AGN but little stellar component, DCBHs are able to\nreproduce the observed spectral shape and properties under multiple scenarios -\nhigh dust attenuation or AGN surrounded by dense gas - that have been proposed\nto explain the unique shape of LRD spectra.

This issue is often\ntreated as an isolated problem primarily because decoherence is often invoked\nto tackle such problems and decoherence, in principle, doesn't leaves any\nobservational imprints. However, that's not the case if one invokes the\ncollapse models of quantum mechanics to resolve such a problem, because the\ncollapse models do modify the Schr\\\"{o}dinger evolution of the quantum system\nand the modified dynamics is bound to leave imprints.

We used\nsymmetry-adapted perturbation theory to rationalize the interaction of CO on\nthe different binding sites.\n  Results. We find that both ASW morphologies yield similar Gaussian-like BE\ndistributions with mean values near 900 K. However, the nature of the binding\ninteractions is rather different and critically depends on surface roughness\nand dangling-OH bonds. Simulated TPD curves reproduce experimental trends\nacross several coverage regimes. From an astrochemical point of view, the\napplication of the full BE distribution has a dramatic influence on the CO\ndistribution in protoplanetary disks, leading to a broader CO snowline region,\nimproving predictions of CO gas-ice partitioning, and suggesting an equally\nbroader distribution of organics in these objects."}

While all AGNs are intrinsically variable, the classic\nAGN unification model predicts that type~2 AGNs rarely vary because their\nengines are obstructed by dust tori. Previous UV-to-near-IR variability studies\nlargely support this expectation. Here, we present a variability study by James\nWebb Space Telescope (JWST) that reveals a more subtle picture. Using NIRCam\nimaging data from three surveys over $\\sim$140~arcmin$^2$ in the COSMOS field,\nwe found 117 galaxies with $\\geq 4$$\\sigma$ variability in the F356W band\nacross a $\\sim$2-year baseline.

One additional variable was identified at $z=0.90$ using\nthe archival Keck telescope data. These six objects form our spectroscopic\nsubsample.

The galaxy was identified among the sample of bar-like galaxies\nstudied before and has the earliest bar formation time among the tidally\ninduced subsample of those objects. Its disk transformed into a bar as a result\nof a close interaction with a massive progenitor of a brightest cluster galaxy\n(BCG).

This temporary distortion also made\nit look like a bar with spiral extensions of up to 6 kpc. The long-lived bar\nformed later was about 3 kpc long and grew over the next few gigayears.

It typically relies on comparing observed\nabundance-to-iron ratios with theoretical predictions relative to the Sun, but\nthis method is prone to uncertainty due to limitations of classical 1D\nhydrostatic models. One promising but still underexplored approach is to\nmeasure the isotopic composition of stellar atmospheres by focusing on elements\nthat have both slow (s)-process and rapid (r)-process contributions. While the\nstudy of total elemental abundances offers a simplified view, isotopic ratios\nare directly linked to the underlying nucleosynthesis processes. Our aim is to\nprovide a reliable method for quantifying the contributions of the s- and\nr-processes to barium in stellar atmospheres. This is achieved by determining\nbarium isotopic ratios using 1D atmospheric models in combination with a\ncarefully calibrated microturbulence, based on the comparison between\nsubordinate and resonance Ba lines. In this initial study, we use member stars\nof the globular cluster NGC 6752 to calibrate the microturbulence ($v_{mic}$)\nvalue for both subordinate and resonance barium lines across different stellar\nevolutionary stages. This allows us to provide a reliable estimate of $v_{mic}$\nthat can be applied to accurately determine barium abundances and isotopic\nratios in stars ranging from the main sequence to the upper red giant branch.\nThe $v_{mic}$ scale adapted for barium subordinate lines is consistent with\nthat derived from 3D model atmospheres, and thus the $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$-log $g$\ndependent relations of the later can be used safely. The $v_{mic}$ for the\nresonance line at $\\lambda$4934 Angstrom -- for the determination of the\nisotopic ratio -- is higher, and depends on the equivalent width (EW). We\nprovide calibrated relations between $v_{mic}$ and EW for measuring isotopic\nratios."}

Most bars form rapidly in\ndynamically cold discs shortly after the central stellar mass exceeds that of\ndark matter. In these cases, bar formation is consistent with secular\ninstabilities driven by the disc's self-gravity, which organises stellar orbits\ninto a coherent bar structure. However, around 25 per cent of barred galaxies\nare dark matter dominated at the time of bar formation, $t_{bar}$, and remain\nso thereafter. We trace the origin of these bars to tidal perturbations induced\nby passing satellites or mergers using a new metric, $S_{bar}$, quantifying the\ntidal field acting on the galaxy. At the time of bar formation, we find a\nnegative correlation between $S_{bar}$ and the central stellar-to-dark matter\nmass fraction, indicating that more dark matter-dominated discs require\nstronger tides to trigger bar formation. These tidally induced bars are more\nlikely to be transient than those that form secularly, although bar properties\nare otherwise similar.

(2) To conduct concurrent\nobservations with NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space telescope. Due to the\ndifferent lines of sight between the ground and space, we detect slight\nvariations in light curves, known as ``Space-based parallax.\" This effect\nallows us to measure the mass of lens systems and their distance from the\nEarth. It is the only method to measure the mass of the free-floating planets\ndown to Earth-mass. We begin the GB survey in February 2024 and analyzed images\nthrough June 1, 2025, identifying 486 microlensing candidates and over a\nthousand variable stars, including Mira variables, which are useful to study\nthe Galactic structure. We issue real-time alerts for follow-up observations,\nsupporting exoplanet searches, and the chemical evolution studies in the GB.\nDuring the off-bulge season, we conduct an all-sky grid survey and Target of\nOpportunity (ToO) observations of transients, including gravitational wave\nevents, gamma-ray bursts, and other science."}

Following the training and testing phases, we\napplied the networks to air-shower data triggered by scintillation detectors of\nthe prototype station for the enhancement of IceTop, IceCube's surface array at\nthe South Pole. Over a four-month period, we identified 554 cosmic-ray events\nin coincidence with IceTop, approximately five times more compared to a\nreference method based on a cut on the signal-to-noise ratio. Comparisons with\nIceTop measurements of the same air showers confirmed that the CNNs reliably\nidentified cosmic-ray radio pulses and outperformed the reference method.\nAdditionally, we find that CNNs reduce the false-positive rate of air-shower\ncandidates and effectively denoise radio waveforms, thereby improving the\naccuracy of the power and arrival time reconstruction of radio pulses."}

The birth of DCBHs is associated\nwith a significant gas compaction event, followed by a phase of intense\nluminosity in the 200 Myr after their birth, and subsequently by the formation\nof the first PopIII stars in these very haloes.

However, it has\nbeen recently pointed out that a number of other physical and beyond-GR\neffects, could imitate, or be mimicked by, eccentric CBCs. In this work, we\npropose a conceptually simple but powerful method to directly confirm or reject\nthe eccentric hypothesis, without needing to compare the hypothesis with the\nplethora of other possible hypotheses. The key idea is that while spurious\nnon-zero values of eccentricity, at some reference frequency, could be acquired\nwhen a non-eccentric CBC with additional physical/beyond-GR effects is\nrecovered with an eccentric CBC waveform model, the {\\it evolution} of\neccentricity with frequency will in general not be mimicked. We accordingly\nformulate an eccentricity evolution consistency test (EECT). The method\ncompares the eccentricity recovered at some low frequency value (e.g, $10$ Hz),\nevolved to higher frequencies assuming GR, with eccentricities recovered at\nthose same higher frequencies. Discrepancy between the two eccentricities at\nany reference frequency would violate EECT and indicate the presence of a\nmimicker. As a proof of concept, assuming a few eccentric CBC systems,\nquasi-circular CBCs with additional physics mimicking eccentricity, and an\nO4-like three-detector-network configuration, we demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod is indeed able to reject mimickers at $\\geq 68\\%$ confidence, while\nensuring that truly eccentric CBCs satisfy EECT."}

It typically relies on comparing observed\nabundance-to-iron ratios with theoretical predictions relative to the Sun, but\nthis method is prone to uncertainty due to limitations of classical 1D\nhydrostatic models. One promising but still underexplored approach is to\nmeasure the isotopic composition of stellar atmospheres by focusing on elements\nthat have both slow (s)-process and rapid (r)-process contributions. While the\nstudy of total elemental abundances offers a simplified view, isotopic ratios\nare directly linked to the underlying nucleosynthesis processes. Our aim is to\nprovide a reliable method for quantifying the contributions of the s- and\nr-processes to barium in stellar atmospheres. This is achieved by determining\nbarium isotopic ratios using 1D atmospheric models in combination with a\ncarefully calibrated microturbulence, based on the comparison between\nsubordinate and resonance Ba lines. In this initial study, we use member stars\nof the globular cluster NGC 6752 to calibrate the microturbulence ($v_{mic}$)\nvalue for both subordinate and resonance barium lines across different stellar\nevolutionary stages. This allows us to provide a reliable estimate of $v_{mic}$\nthat can be applied to accurately determine barium abundances and isotopic\nratios in stars ranging from the main sequence to the upper red giant branch.\nThe $v_{mic}$ scale adapted for barium subordinate lines is consistent with\nthat derived from 3D model atmospheres, and thus the $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$-log $g$\ndependent relations of the later can be used safely. The $v_{mic}$ for the\nresonance line at $\\lambda$4934 Angstrom -- for the determination of the\nisotopic ratio -- is higher, and depends on the equivalent width (EW). We\nprovide calibrated relations between $v_{mic}$ and EW for measuring isotopic\nratios."}
