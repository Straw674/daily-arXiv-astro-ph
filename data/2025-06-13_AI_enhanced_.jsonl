The grism\nspectra from the JWST COSMOS-3D program confirm that both galaxies host an AGN.\nA bipolar radio jet from one AGN extends to strike the merging front. In\naddition, we detect a starburst at the merging front, characterized by luminous\nextended nebular line emission and a massive cold gas reservoir. This starburst\nis likely triggered by interstellar shocks induced by galaxy collision and the\nAGN jet. The twin ring structure of the Cosmic Owl requires further numerical\nsimulations to clarify the precise conditions that lead to the formation of\nthis rare morphology.

Leveraging PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1\nand PHANGS-MUSE data, we measure the PAH and dust continuum emission lifetimes\nof gas clouds across 17 nearby star-forming galaxies by analyzing the relative\nspatial distributions of mid-IR (7.7-11.3$\\mu$m) and H$\\alpha$ emission at\nvarious scales. We find that the mid-IR emitting time-scale of gas clouds in\ngalaxy disks (excluding centers) ranges from 10 to 30Myr. After star formation\nis detected in H$\\alpha$, mid-IR emission persists for 3-7Myr during the\nstellar feedback phase, covering 70-80% of the H$\\alpha$ emission. This\nsignificant overlap is due to intense radiation from star-forming regions,\nilluminating the surrounding PAHs and dust grains. In most galaxies, the mid-IR\ntime-scale closely matches the molecular cloud lifetime measured with CO.\nAlthough mid-IR emission is complex as influenced by ISM distribution,\nradiation, and abundances of dust and PAHs, the similarity between the two\ntime-scales suggests that once gas clouds form with compact mid-IR emission,\nthey quickly provide sufficient shielding for stable CO formation. This is\nlikely due to our focus on molecular gas-rich regions of galaxies with\nnear-solar metallicity. Finally, we find that the mid-IR emitting time-scale is\nlonger in galaxies with well-defined HII regions and less structured\nbackgrounds, allowing photons to more efficiently heat the ambient ISM\nsurrounding the HII regions, rather than contributing to diffuse emission. This\nsuggests that the shape of the ISM also influences mid-IR emission.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528JWST\u548cMUSE\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e8617\u4e2a\u90bb\u8fd1\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u6c14\u4f53\u4e91\u7684\u591a\u73af\u82b3\u70c3\uff08PAH\uff09\u548c\u5c18\u57c3\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u53d1\u5c04\u5bff\u547d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u5bff\u547d\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u661f\u9645\u4ecb\u8d28\u5f62\u6001\u5bf9\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "background": "JWST\u7684\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u90bb\u8fd1\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u661f\u9645\u4ecb\u8d28\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u6c14\u4f53\u4e91\u4e2dPAH\u548c\u5c18\u57c3\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "data": "PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1\u548cPHANGS-MUSE\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\uff087.7-11.3\u5fae\u7c73\uff09\u548cH\u03b1\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u548cH\u03b1\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6d4b\u91cf\u6c14\u4f53\u4e91\u7684PAH\u548c\u5c18\u57c3\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u53d1\u5c04\u5bff\u547d\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6c14\u4f53\u4e91\u7684\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u53d1\u5c04\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e3a10-30Myr\uff0c\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u4e91\u5bff\u547d\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u4e14\u661f\u9645\u4ecb\u8d28\u5f62\u6001\uff08\u5982HII\u533a\u57df\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

This trail includes the remarkable, ultra-diffuse galaxies DF2 and\nDF4 which lack dark matter and host unusually luminous globular clusters. It\nhas been proposed that the trail formed via a high-speed collision between two\ngas-rich dwarf galaxies. This scenario predicts that the trail galaxies are\nkinematically connected and follow a specific trend in radial velocity as a\nfunction of position, based on the known velocities and positions of DF2 and\nDF4. To test this hypothesis, we measured radial velocities for seven\nadditional galaxies on the trail. While the galaxies' low surface brightnesses\npresented observational challenges, we employ several methods to obtain\nmeasurements for galaxies with effective surface brightnesses up to 28.6 mag\narcsec$^{-2}$, including a narrow slit placed over globular clusters and a\nnovel wide slit mode on Keck/LRIS, as well as a 'light bucket' mode on\nKeck/KCWI. We find that five of our seven targets follow the precise velocity\ntrend predicted by DF2 and DF4, to a degree with just a 2% chance of randomly\noccurring. Moreover, the trail galaxies' radial velocities are significantly\nhigher than those of the NGC 1052 group, setting it apart as a separate,\nkinematically connected system. Our findings support the theory that this trail\nof galaxies, including DF2 and DF4, formed together in a single event.

In this study, we\ninvestigate the outermost regions of the Milky Way disc using two previously\nunstudied open clusters -Auner 1 and Berkeley 102- located at Galactocentric\ndistances of approximately 14 kpc in largely uncharted areas of the Galaxy. We\nobtained medium-resolution spectra (R > 18,700) using the MEGARA integral-field\nunit (IFU) spectrograph on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), targeting\nred giant member stars in both clusters.

Additionally, we provide updated\nestimates of the clusters' ages and distances. Both clusters are old (3.2 +-\n0.7 Ga), distant (d ~ 8 kpc), and lie below the Galactic plane (Z Gal ~ -0.7\nkpc), with moderate extinction (AV ~ 1.3 mag). We find that Auner 1 has a\nmetallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.30 +- 0.09 and Berkeley 102 of [Fe/H] = -0.35 +-\n0.06, consistent with other clusters at similar Galactocentric radii and\nindicating minimal azimuthal variation in metallicity.

The selected stars formed before the\ncontribution from the main s-process in low- and intermediate-mass stars became\nsignificant. Some of our sample stars are enhanced in Sr, with [Sr/Ba] reaching\nup to 0.7. These stars gained their high Sr abundance from a poorly understood\nprocess, which may appear to be a weak s-process or a weak r-process. Our aim\nis to uncover the nature of this additional Sr source. The abundances derived\nfrom the resonance Ba II lines are influenced by the adopted Ba isotope\nmixture. We compute Ba isotope mixtures corresponding to different r- to\ns-process contributions and determine the corresponding abundances from the Ba\nII resonance lines in each sample star. Additionally, we determine Ba\nabundances from weak subordinate Ba II lines, which are unaffected by the\nadopted Ba isotope mixture. We then compare the Ba abundances derived from the\nsubordinate lines with those from the Ba II resonance lines. We find a higher\ns-process contribution to Ba isotopes in stars with greater [Sr/Eu] and [Sr/Ba]\noverabundances, suggesting that the additional Sr synthesis was due to the\nearly s-process occurring in massive stars. We estimate the [Sr/Ba] ratio\nproduced by the early s-process and obtain [Sr/Ba]_earlyS = 1.1 +- 0.2.\nRegarding the potential synthesis of Sr and Ba in the i-process in massive\nstars, our results argue that there was no detectable contribution from this\nprocess within the error bars in our sample stars.

AGE-PRO aims to systematically trace the evolution of gas disk mass and\nsize throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. It uses a carefully\nselected sample of 30 disks around M3-K6 stars in three nearby star-forming\nregions: Ophiuchus (0.5-1 Myr), Lupus (1-3 Myr), and Upper Sco (2-6 Myr).\nAssuming the three regions had similar initial conditions and evolutionary\npaths, we find the median gas disk mass appears to decrease with age. Ophiuchus\ndisks have the highest median gas mass (6 M$_{\\rm Jup}$), while the Lupus and\nUpper Sco disks have significantly lower median masses (0.68 and 0.44 M$_{\\rm\nJup}$, respectively). Notably, the gas and dust disk masses appear to evolve on\ndifferent timescales.

During observations made as part of\nthe AGE-PRO ALMA Large program, significant variability in the brightness of\nthe 2MASS J16202863-2442087 system was detected between individual executions.\nWe report the observed properties of the variability detected at millimetre\nwavelengths and investigate potential driving mechanisms. To investigate the\nnature of the variability we construct a light curve from the continuum\nobservations and analyse imaged constructed from both flaring and quiescent\nemission. We characterise the dust disk around the star through analysis in the\nimage and visibility plane, and carry out kinematic analysis of the CO(2-1)\nemission from the gas disk. The continuum flux decays by a factor of 8 in less\nthan an hour, and by a factor of 13 within 8 days. The peak brightness\ncoincides with an expected brightness maximum extrapolated from the periodicity\nof previously observed optical variability. The flare is most likely the\nproduct of synchrotron emission in the close vicinity of the star. The nature\nof the millimetre flare closely resembles those detected in very close binary\nsystems, and may be due to the interaction of magnetic fields in an as yet\nundetected binary. Alternatively if the central host is a single-star object,\nthe flare may be due to the interaction of magnetic field loops at the stellar\nsurface or a strong accretion burst.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b02MASS J16202863-2442087\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7684\u4eae\u5ea6\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u6052\u661f\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u8f90\u5c04\u6216\u78c1\u573a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u3002", "background": "\u539f\u884c\u661f\u76d8\u5728\u6beb\u7c73\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u6781\u4e3a\u7f55\u89c1\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5bbf\u4e3b\u6052\u661f\u672c\u8eab\u800c\u975e\u5176\u76d8\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u975e\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u673a\u5236\u3002", "data": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86AGE-PRO ALMA\u5927\u578b\u9879\u76ee\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u548cCO(2-1)\u6c14\u4f53\u76d8\u53d1\u5c04\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5149\u53d8\u66f2\u7ebf\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8000\u53d1\u548c\u9759\u6b62\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u5bf9\u5c18\u57c3\u76d8\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u6d41\u91cf\u5728\u4e0d\u5230\u4e00\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185\u8870\u51cf\u4e868\u500d\uff0c8\u5929\u5185\u8870\u51cf\u4e8613\u500d\uff1b\u8000\u53d1\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6052\u661f\u9644\u8fd1\u540c\u6b65\u8f90\u5c04\u6216\u78c1\u573a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u53cc\u661f\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the detection and localization\ncapabilities of future sub-mHz GW observatories for MBBH coalescences.\nIncluding the full galactic foreground noise, we find that signal-to-noise\nratios (SNRs) can reach several thousand across a wide range of redshifts. We\nevaluate three representative orbital configurations--non-precessing and\nprecessing with different inclination angles--and analyze their localization\nperformance for various MBBH populations. In the non-precessing case, a\ntwo-hemisphere degeneracy arises when only the dominant (2,2) mode is\nconsidered, which is effectively resolved by including higher-order modes.\nThese modes contribute to a more uniform performance across all configurations,\nthereby mitigating the prior advantage of precessing mission orbits. Sub-mHz\nmissions operating in the [10 $\\mu$Hz, 10 mHz] band partially overlap with\nLISA's range but provide enhanced sensitivity to lower-frequency GWs due to\ntheir longer interferometric baselines. This results in significantly improved\nlocalization of high-mass MBBHs, enhancing the prospects for multi-messenger\nastronomy and precision cosmology. Moreover, the high SNRs attainable with\nsub-mHz detectors could enable stringent tests of general relativity and\nalternative theories of gravity.", "AI": {"tldr": "This study evaluates the detection and localization capabilities of future sub-millihertz gravitational wave observatories for massive binary black hole mergers, highlighting improved sensitivity and potential for multi-messenger astronomy.", "background": "Future space-based gravitational wave missions aim to explore the sub-millihertz to microhertz frequency band, focusing on detecting massive binary black hole mergers across cosmic distances, addressing gaps in current capabilities.", "data": "The study includes the full galactic foreground noise and evaluates three representative orbital configurations of massive binary black holes.", "method": "The research analyzes signal-to-noise ratios and localization performance for various massive binary black hole populations, considering non-precessing and precessing orbital configurations with different inclination angles.", "result": "Sub-millihertz missions achieve high signal-to-noise ratios and improved localization of high-mass binary black holes, enabling multi-messenger astronomy and tests of general relativity."}}

In this letter, guided by these two coincidences, we\ninvestigate how a chiral dark QCD model with a MeV-scale dark photon can\nresolve the core-cusp problem.
