One open\nquestion is the driving mechanism of galaxy-scale outflows. At low redshift,\nradio jets often interact with the ISM, generating turbulence and driving\nionized outflows. Despite this evidence at low redshift, relatively few studies\nhave investigated the radio-ionized gas connection at cosmic noon. Thus, our\nmain goal is to conduct a pilot study using VLA data for three quasars with\nmoderate/high radio power, which have ionized outflows identified in\nobservations from the SUPER survey. We used [OIII] data from SINFONI analyzed\nin earlier studies, along with new 6.2 GHz VLA radio observations, at\ncomparable spatial resolution. We also incorporate radio data from the\nliterature to explore the radio emission. We detected extended radio structure\nin our VLA A-array data for two quasars. The extended structure in J1333+1649\naligns with the smaller-scale emission seen in archival images, suggesting a\njet propagating from nuclear to galaxy-wide scales. In all three quasars, we\nfound that the brightest radio emission and ionized gas have comparable spatial\nscales. Furthermore, the position angles of the radio emission and ionized gas\npresent small offsets for the two targets with extended structures. Given that\nthe kinematics of the ionized gas in all three quasars is dominated by\noutflows, our results suggest a strong connection between radio emission and\nionized outflows in typical AGN at cosmic noon. Based on energetic\nconsiderations and comparisons with archival data, radio jets could be a\nsignificant mechanism for driving outflows in AGN from cosmic noon to low\nredshifts. However, with the exception of one object (J1333+1649), we cannot\nrule out the possibility that the radio emission arises from shocks in the\ninterstellar medium caused by disk winds or radiatively driven outflows."}

We have developed the Antarctic Infrared\nBinocular Telescope (AIRBT) to study the dynamic infrared sky at Dome A,\nAntarctica, taking advantage of the superb infrared observational conditions at\nthis site. AIRBT consists of two identical 15 cm f/3 optical tube assemblies\nand two cost-effective indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) cameras equipped with J\nand H filters, respectively. The cameras have 640 x 512 pixels with a size of\n15 micrometers, providing a scale of 6.9 arcseconds per pixel and a field of\nview of 1.22 x 0.97 square degrees. We characterize the performance of the\nInGaAs cameras, including bias, readout noise, dark current, nonlinearity, and\nphoton transfer curve. Our analysis highlights the distinct behaviors of InGaAs\ncameras compared with charge-coupled devices (CCDs). The bias and readout noise\nshow temperature dependence, and the noise measured from the photon transfer\ncurves has additional components that increase with exposure time. On-sky tests\nwere conducted in October 2022 including system calibration, limiting depth,\nand photometric precision. For a single 3-second exposure, we achieved 5-sigma\nlimiting magnitudes of 11.2 mag (Vega system) in J band and 9.7 mag in H band.\nThe best photometric precision reached 20 millimagnitudes at the bright end,\nwhich could be further improved to sub-percent levels through image stacking.\nAIRBT was installed at Dome A in January 2023, and scientific observations\nbegan as soon as darkness set in."}

Detailed analysis of their properties allows us to probe the\nactivity history of the galactic nucleus and, potentially, other properties of\nthe host galaxy. A recent paper presents detailed radial velocity profiles of\noutflows in ten AGN host galaxies and shows a common trend of approximately\nconstant velocity in the centre followed by rapid acceleration outside $R_{\\rm\ntr} \\sim 1 - 3$ kpc. We show that this is a consequence of the AGN-driven\noutflows clearing the gaseous bulges of the host galaxies and beginning to\nexpand into a region of negligible gas density. We used a 1D semi-analytical\ncode to calculate outflow propagation in each of the ten galaxies, assuming a\nconstant AGN luminosity and an isothermal bulge density profile, with a finite\nbulge radius, and leaving the gas fraction and total mass of the bulge as free\nparameters. We also considered the effect of different gas density profiles,\nvariations in bulge velocity dispersion, AGN luminosity, and the effect of\noutflow fragmentation. Our simplest model can fit six outflow profiles\nessentially perfectly, while another can be fit if the bulge gas density\nprofile is shallower than isothermal. A shallower density profile also improves\nthe fit in the central regions of the remaining three outflows, but they\naccelerate faster than our models predict; this could be evidence of\nsignificant gas cooling and star formation that reduce the total mass of\noutflowing gas. We conclude that a simple AGN-driven wind feedback model can\nexplain the detailed velocity profiles of real outflows in local AGN hosts. The\nfree parameters of our model have values that fall well within reasonable\nranges. This suggests that the simple scenario we envisioned is close to the\ntrue conditions governing the general trends of large-scale outflow expansion."}

NASA has established\nseveral science requirements for the GBTDS to ensure RGES success. A key\nadvantage of RGES is Roman's high angular resolution, which will allow\ndetection of flux from many host stars. One requirement specifies that Roman\nmust measure the masses and distances of 40% of detected planet hosts with 20%\nprecision or better. To test this, we simulated microlensing events toward the\nGBTDS fields and used Fisher matrix analysis to estimate light curve parameter\nuncertainties. Combining these with Roman imaging observables (lens flux,\nrelative lens-source proper motion), we estimated the achievable precision of\nlens mass and distance measurements. Using pyLIMASS, a publicly available code\nfor estimating lens properties, we applied this analysis to 3,000 simulated\nevents. Assuming the Cassan et al.

We validated our approach by\ncomparing our inferred lens masses and distances to empirical measurements from\ndetailed image-constrained light curve modeling of historical microlensing\nevents with Hubble and Keck follow-up imaging. Our results agree within roughly\n1 sigma, demonstrating that both approaches yield consistent and reliable mass\nand distance estimates, and confirming the robustness of our simulations for\nRoman-era microlensing science."}

As in the standard LQC, the classical singularities are\nresolved by quantum bounce. Remarkably, mLQC-I exhibits a distinctive feature:\nfollowing the bounce, the shear is dynamically suppressed and decays rapidly to\nzero within the deep quantum regime. This occurs independently of the\ncollapsing matter fields, leading to a natural quantum isotropization.\nConsequently, the three spatial directions expand rapidly to macroscopic\nscales, producing a homogeneous and isotropic universe directly from the\nquantum epoch without fine-tuning.

NASA has established\nseveral science requirements for the GBTDS to ensure RGES success. A key\nadvantage of RGES is Roman's high angular resolution, which will allow\ndetection of flux from many host stars. One requirement specifies that Roman\nmust measure the masses and distances of 40% of detected planet hosts with 20%\nprecision or better. To test this, we simulated microlensing events toward the\nGBTDS fields and used Fisher matrix analysis to estimate light curve parameter\nuncertainties. Combining these with Roman imaging observables (lens flux,\nrelative lens-source proper motion), we estimated the achievable precision of\nlens mass and distance measurements. Using pyLIMASS, a publicly available code\nfor estimating lens properties, we applied this analysis to 3,000 simulated\nevents. Assuming the Cassan et al. (2012) exoplanet mass function, we find that\n>40% of host stars meet the required 20% precision threshold, confirming that\nthe GBTDS can satisfy the mission requirement. We validated our approach by\ncomparing our inferred lens masses and distances to empirical measurements from\ndetailed image-constrained light curve modeling of historical microlensing\nevents with Hubble and Keck follow-up imaging. Our results agree within roughly\n1 sigma, demonstrating that both approaches yield consistent and reliable mass\nand distance estimates, and confirming the robustness of our simulations for\nRoman-era microlensing science."}

The timescale associated with the bend correlates well with the\nmass of the black hole and may also correlate with bolometric luminosity in the\n`X-ray variability plane'. Because AGN light curves are usually irregularly\nsampled, the estimation of AGN power spectra is challenging.

Lensed gravitational waves in particular allow for\nunparalleled sensitivity to small scale structures within the lenses, due to\nthe precise time resolution in combination with the continuous monitoring of\nthe entire sky. In this work, we show two distinct ways of using strongly\nlensed gravitational waves to identify the presence of dark matter subhalos:\n\\emph{{i)}} through higher order caustics generating high relative\nmagnification ($\\mu_r > 2$), short time delay image pairs that break the\ncaustic universality relations of single dark matter halos, which occur for\n$\\sim 1-10$ percent of strongly lensed events in our cold dark matter models,\nand \\emph{ii)} through the presence of more than three highly magnified images,\nwhich occur for $\\sim 0.01-1$ percent of the same simulated events. We find\nthat these results are highly sensitive to the concentrations of subhalos in\nour simulations, and more mildly to their number densities. The presence of\nlow-mass subhalos increases the probability of observing wave-optics lensing in\nlensed gravitational waves, which is studied by solving the diffraction\nintegral with the stationary phase approximation, as well as numerically. We\nalso report distinct quantitative and qualitative differences in the\ndistributions of relative magnifications and time delays for subhalo\npopulations with increased number densities or concentrations. With the\nupcoming detection of strongly lensed events by ground- and space- based\ndetectors, comparisons against these simulated distributions will provide\ninsight into the nature of dark matter."}
