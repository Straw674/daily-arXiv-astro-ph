Our analysis includes high-quality optical data from the Multi\nUnit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) for NGC\n5728, supplemented by infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope\n(JWST). Our previous results indicate that CRs are instrumental in heating the\ninner regions of gas clouds, enhancing emission of low-ionization optical\nlines. Mid-infrared data reveal that emission lines like [Ar II] and [Ne II]\nwithin the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) field of view are sensitive to\nCRs. In contrast, high-ionization lines (for example, [Ne V]) serve as robust\ntracers of photoionization insensitive to CRs. Moreover, mixed optical and MIR\ndiagnostics offer insight into the relative roles of CRs and shocks, which\noften produce similar signatures in emission lines. We find that while both\nmechanisms can elevate certain line ratios, their influence on MIR diagnostics\ndiverges: shocks and CRs affect low-ionization lines differently, allowing for\na better understanding when multi-wavelength data are available.

We present NIRCam/SWC photometry of the GC system in four bands (F090W,\nF115W, F150W, F200W). The spatial distribution of the system matches well in\nradial and ellipticity profile with the high elongation (b/a = 0.5) of the BCG\nhalo light. The total GC population within MACS0417 is estimated to be near 1.5\nx 10^5, similar to the systems in Abell 2744, Coma, and other galaxy clusters\nwith comparable masses. With similar results for GC photometry in hand from\nother lensing clusters at a range of redshifts, it is now possible to trace on\npurely observational grounds the luminosity evolution of GC systems over many\nGigayears of lookback time, as seen through their color-magnitude diagrams. We\nshow this sequence for five systems reaching to lookback times of more than 7\nGyr. A systematic change in the GC/UCD sequence with lookback time is clearly\nvisible, near what is expected for age-fading of a simple stellar population\nwith time. Lastly, we evaluate the effectiveness of the various JWST NIRCam\nfilters for broadband photometry of GC systems as a function of redshift, as an\naid to planning further studies."}

To address these objectives, PUNCH uses a constellation\nof four small spacecraft in Sun-synchronous low Earth orbit, to collect\nlinearly polarized images of the K corona and young solar wind. The four\nspacecraft each carry one visible-light imager in a 1+3 configuration: a single\nNarrow Field Imager solar coronagraph captures images of the outer corona at\nall position angles, and at solar elongations from 1.5{\\deg} (6 R$_\\odot$) to\n8{\\deg} (32 R$_\\odot$); and three separate Wide Field Imager heliospheric\nimagers together capture views of the entire inner solar system, at solar\nelongations from 3{\\deg} (12 R$_\\odot$) to 45{\\deg} (180 R$_\\odot$) from the\nSun. PUNCH images include linear-polarization data, to enable inferring the\nthree-dimensional structure of visible features without stereoscopy. The\ninstruments are matched in wavelength passband, support overlapping\ninstantaneous fields of view, and are operated synchronously, to act as a\nsingle ``virtual instrument'' with a 90{\\deg} wide field of view, centered on\nthe Sun. PUNCH launched in March of 2025 and began science operations in June\nof 2025. PUNCH has an open data policy with no proprietary period, and PUNCH\nScience Team Meetings are open to all."}

III) stars, the first stellar generation built up\nfrom metal-free primordial gas, first started to form at redshifts z ~ 30. They\nformed primarily in small dark matter halos with masses of a few million solar\nmasses. The cooling of the gas in these halos was dominated on all scales by\nmolecular hydrogen. Current theoretical models indicate that Pop. III stars\ntypically formed in small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function\ndue to widespread fragmentation in the protostellar accretion disks around\nthese primordial stars. Massive Pop. III stars are thought to have played a\npivotal role in shaping the early Universe, as their feedback regulates\nsubsequent star formation, although the immediate effects of this feedback\nremain uncertain. Direct detection of Pop. III stars is challenging, but our\nchances of detecting at least a few Pop. III supernovae within the next decade\nare brighter. Indirect approaches based on stellar archaeology or gravitational\nwave detections offer promising constraints. Current observations suggest that\nmost massive Pop.

The innumerable folds of this\nsheet in the inner regions of a galactic halo would appear on solar-system\nscales like an extremely large number of spatially overlapping streams of dark\nmatter particles. Some of these streams may also receive amplified densities if\ndark matter undergoes enhanced clustering in the early Universe, as is the case\nfor axions in the post-inflationary scenario. This ultra-fine-grained dark\nmatter substructure is usually considered irrelevant and undetectable for most\ndirect detection experiments, but for axion haloscopes, this may not be the\ncase. We develop and explore several plausible models for the degree of\nfine-grained axion dark matter substructure so as to evaluate its impact on the\ndetectability of axions. We find that not only is this substructure detectable\nin haloscope experiments, but that it may enhance the detectability of the\naxion if data is analysed with a high-enough frequency resolution. This\nconclusion motivates ongoing high-resolution analyses of axion data by\nhaloscope collaborations, which have the potential to reveal evidence of the\nQCD axion even if their nominal experimental sensitivity does not reach the\nrequired level under the Standard Halo Model assumption."}

The second step of gravitational collapse\nsets the radiative efficiency and accretion rate of the young protostar. These\ntwo parameters, of prime importance for protostellar evolution, dictate the\nluminosities and thus play a key role in deciphering the current discrepancy\nbetween observational surveys and theoretical models. In this letter, we\nprovide quantitative estimates on the evolution of the radiative efficiency and\naccretion rate obtained from self-consistent, high-resolution, radiative\nhydrodynamic simulations performed using the codes PLUTO and RAMSES. The main\nhighlight of our result is that the radiative efficiency reaches unity, that\nis, supercriticality, relatively quickly after protostellar birth.\nSupercriticality at the accretion shock is a necessary condition for cold\naccretion. Our results thus support a rapid transition to the cold accretion\nscenario, which is one of the assumptions used in Pre-Main Sequence (PMS)\nmodels working towards solutions to explain observational data. We briefly\ndiscuss the implications of the time evolution of the radiative efficiency\nfactor in the context of the luminosity problem, the Protostellar Luminosity\nFunction (PLF), PMS evolution, accurate sink properties, and the stellar\nInitial Mass Function (IMF)."}

Accepted for publication in ApJ", "summary": "Reliable estimation of stellar surface gravity (log $g$) for a large sample\nis crucial for evaluating stellar evolution models and understanding galactic\nstructure; However, it is not easy to accomplish due to the difficulty in\ngathering a large spectroscopic data set. Photometric sky survey using a\nspecific filter, on the other hand, can play a substantial role in the\nassessment of log $g$. The Stellar Abundances and Galactic Evolution Survey\n(SAGES) utilizes eight filters to provide accurate stellar parameters for\n$\\sim10^{7}$ stars, with its DDO51 intermediate-band filter specifically\ndesigned for robust log $g$ determination. In this work, the observed SAGES\n$u_{\\rm SC}$ and $v_{\\rm SAGES}$ photometry, the synthetic photometry in $g$,\n$r$, $i$, and DDO51 bands derived from \\textit{Gaia} XP spectra are employed to\ninvestigate the importance of the DDO51 filter in the determination of log $g$.\nWe applied machine-learning-based extinction correction and employed XGBoost\nmodels, trained on stellar parameters from LAMOST, to predict log $g$ using\nphotometric data. By comparing model predicted log $g$ with LAMOST values, we\nfind that including DDO51 filter improve the accuracies of log $g$ estimates by\n21.0\\% (from 0.224\\,dex to 0.177\\,dex) overall, and by 26.5\\% (from 0.302\\,dex\nto 0.222\\,dex ) for GK-type stars, as compared to those obtained without DDO51.\nThe DDO51 filter is also validated to be particularly effective for metal-poor\nstars ([Fe/H]$<$-1.0), where it significantly mitigates systematic biases. Our\nfindings highlight the diagnostic power of the SAGES DDO51 filter, providing\nenhanced stellar characterization vital for future in-depth studies of the\nMilky Way."}
