### [1] [The effects of the orbital configurations of mergers on reshaping galaxy structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02051)
*Xinyi Wu,Ling Zhu,Jiang Chang,Guangquan Zeng,Yu Lei*

**TL;DR**: 通过分析531对星系合并案例，发现合并轨道构型显著影响残余星系结构形成：螺旋轨道合并倾向于保留盘状结构并增加暖成分比例，而直接碰撞轨道合并则促进核球和热内晕形成，且93%的合并事件会增加热内晕质量比例，其光度占比与外部恒星质量高度相关，同时螺旋轨道合并可能是红但富中性氢星系形成的原因之一。

Background: 研究星系合并轨道构型对残余星系结构形成的影响。

Data: 数据来源于从IllustrisTNG-100中选取的531对合并星系对。

Method: 采用 IllustrisTNG-100 模拟数据，通过动态定义星系四个结构成分（核球、盘、暖成分和热内晕）来量化合并轨道构型对遗迹星系结构形成的影响。

Result: 螺旋轨道合并导致残余星系中盘和暖成分比例更高，而直接碰撞轨道合并导致盘和暖成分比例更低、核球和热内晕成分比例更高。

Abstract: We performed a systematic analysis of how the orbital configuration of a
merger can influence the structural formation of remnant galaxies using 531
merger pairs selected from IllustrisTNG-100. We comprehensively described the
merger orbital configuration, considering the relative orbital motion of the
merger pair and their disk orientations. We quantified the galaxy structures by
dynamically defining four components: bulge, disk, warm component, and hot
inner stellar halo. For mergers on spiral-in orbits, the disk planes of the two
merging galaxies tend to be aligned with the orbital plane, leading to higher
fractions for the disk and warm components, as well as lower fractions for the
bulge and hot inner stellar halo components in the remnant galaxy. For mergers
on direct collision orbits, the disk planes of the two galaxies tend to be
perpendicular to the orbital plane, leading to lower fractions for disk and
warm components, as well as higher fractions of the bulge and hot inner stellar
halo in the remnant. Mergers can lead to either an increase or decrease in the
disk and bulge mass fraction in the remnant compared to the progenitor galaxy,
depending on the merger orbital configurations; however, in 93% of cases,
mergers cause an increase in the hot inner stellar halo. As a result, the
luminosity fraction of the hot inner stellar halo (but not the bulge) in
galaxies at $z=0$ is highly correlated with its total ex situ stellar mass. In
addition, we find that merger on spiral-in orbits is one of the possible
reasons for the formation of recently discovered red but HI-rich (RR) galaxies.

Result: 发现星系COS-2987030247由合并引发的星暴团块组成，主团块处于中度尘埃衰减的恒星形成阶段，而子团块无尘埃且位于恒星形成主序线上或下方。

Abstract: Spatially resolved multi-wavelength analysis is essential to study galaxy
formation and evolution. A UV-bright galaxy COS-2987030247 at $z = 6.81$ is one
of the Rosetta Stones in the epoch of reionization for which JWST NIRSpec
Integral Field Spectroscopy, NIRCam imaging, and ALMA data are available thanks
to the RIOJA program. We identified the rest-frame optical emission lines from
the ionized hydrogen, oxygen, and neon gas. The [OIII] 5008\AA\ line emission
and the NIRCam images show a complex kinematical and morphological structure
where two bright main and three faint clumps are identified in a 10 kpc extent.
The system is not a simple rotating disk, but instead consists of
merger-induced star-forming clumps, as expected from recent cosmological
simulations. The spatially resolved emission line fluxes show that dust
attenuation, metal enrichment, and ionization parameter are preferentially
enhanced in the star formation peaks. Our SED fitting suggests that the main
clumps are in a moderately dust-attenuated star forming phase ($A_{\rm V} =
0.2$--$0.3$ and SFR(H$\alpha$) $\sim 10$\,M$_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$) with almost
zero escape fraction of ionizing photons. In contrast, the sub-clumps are
dust-free and lying on or below the main sequence of star-forming galaxies.
These sub-clumps may work as a perturber that triggers the clumpy starburst in
the surrounding gas through the merger event.

**TL;DR**: 在红移6.81的恒星形成星系COS-2987中发现由致密高温高密度气体与延展低温低密度气体组成的双层电离气体结构，揭示了早期星系星际介质的密度分层特性。

Background: 探索高红移星系中电离气体结构与星际介质的多相性。

Data: 数据来源于JWST/NIRSpec IFS和ALMA的观测，包括[OII]λλ3727,3730、[OIII]4364、[OIII]λλ4960,5008、[OIII]88μm以及Hα和Hβ等关键发射线。

Result: 在星系COS-2987中发现了一种由高温高密度气体和低温低密度气体组成的双相电离气体结构。

Abstract: We report the discovery of a complex, two-phase ionized gas structure in the
star-forming galaxy COS-2987 at $z = 6.81$, revealed by the unprecedented
synergy between JWST/NIRSpec IFS and ALMA observations. These observations
detect key emission lines, including [OII]$\lambda\lambda$ 3727, 3730, [OIII]
4364, [OIII] $\lambda\lambda$ 4960, 5008, [OIII] 88 $\mu$m, as well as
H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$. JWST spectroscopy alone indicates interstellar medium
(ISM) properties that are typical for galaxies at $z\sim7$. These include low
dust extinction ($A_{\rm V} \approx 0.14$ mag), moderate electron density
($n_{\rm e} \approx 500$ cm$^{-3}$), and low gas-phase metallicity
($\sim10\%$). However, the strong far-infrared [OIII] 88 $\mu$m emission
detected by ALMA cannot be explained by a single-phase ionized medium with
uniform electron density and temperature. Instead, a two-phase ISM model,
comprising compact, high-temperature, high-density gas components ($T_e \approx
26,000$ K; $n_e \approx 600 \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$) and an extended, cooler,
lower-density component ($T_e \approx 8,000$ K; $n_e \approx 50
\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$), successfully reproduces the observed line ratios of [OIII]
88 $\mu$m/[OIII] 5008 \r{A} and [OIII] 4364 \r{A}/[OIII] 5008 \r{A}, with a
volume ratio of 1 : 300 between the two phases. Our results demonstrate that
JWST alone probes only a fraction of the ISM and highlight the critical
importance of combining JWST and ALMA to reveal the density-stratified ISM of
early galaxies.

**TL;DR**: 通过高分辨率宇宙模拟发现，早期超大质量黑洞种子在再电离时期可通过超爱丁顿吸积快速增长至10^7太阳质量，其辐射反馈驱动的高速外流影响宿主星系及星系际介质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 探讨活动星系核（AGN）反馈在早期星系形成和超大质量黑洞快速生长中的关键作用。

Data: 使用高分辨率宇宙学zoom-in模拟，模拟套件涵盖无AGN反馈、爱丁顿受限热反馈及更复杂的非爱丁顿受限热、动能和辐射反馈等物理过程。

Method: 采用高分辨率宇宙学模拟方法，逐步涵盖无AGN反馈、爱丁顿受限热反馈及非受限热/动能/辐射反馈等复杂物理设置。

Result: 黑洞种子在z=8时能高效增长至约10^7 M⊙，且其质量增长不受AGN反馈阻碍，其中辐射反馈模型驱动了高速气体外流并轻微抑制宿主星系恒星质量。

Abstract: The vast amount of energy released by active galactic nuclei (AGN) is
increasingly recognized as a key driver of evolution not only in massive
galaxies and clusters, but also in low-mass dwarf galaxies. Despite this, their
role in the early stages of galaxy formation and in self-regulating the rapid
growth of the first and abundant supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains
poorly understood. Through new high-resolution zoom-in cosmological
simulations, we follow the co-evolution of $10^5 M_\odot$ black hole seeds with
their host galaxy. The simulated suite progressively spans physics ranging from
no AGN feedback and Eddington-limited thermal feedback, to more complex setups
including non-Eddington-limited thermal, kinetic and radiative feedback. Across
all our models, we find that black hole seeds efficiently reach masses of
$\sim10^7 M_\odot$ by z=8. Although they exhibit notably different mass growth
histories, these latter seem unimpeded by the presence of AGN feedback. The
simulation including radiative feedback is the most distinct, with
super-Eddington episodes driving fast and mass-loaded gas outflows (exceeding
2500 km $s^{-1}$) up to $\sim$50 kpc, along with minor stellar mass suppression
in the host galaxy. Our measurements are in broad agreement with moderate
luminosity quasars recently observed by JWST, producing overmassive black
holes, dynamical masses of $\sim10^{9.5} M_\odot$, and high, though
short-lived, Eddington fraction accretion rates. These results advocate for a
scenario where AGN feedback allows for rapid SMBH growth during the
reionisation era, while driving winds that extend deep into the intergalactic
medium - shaping host galaxies as well as more distant surroundings.

### [5] [Vertical Structure and Dynamics of a Galactic Disk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02062)
*Chanda J. Jog*

**TL;DR**: 构建了包含恒星、气体和暗物质晕的多组分星系盘垂直结构模型，发现气体和晕显著影响恒星分布使其更靠近中平面且轮廓更陡，质疑了传统单组分模型中常用的sech^2轮廓和恒定标高假设，并利用HI气体标高约束暗晕形状和密度分布。

Background: 研究主题聚焦于星系盘垂直结构的理论建模及其与多组分（恒星、气体和暗物质晕）引力耦合的动力学平衡关系。

Data: 数据来源包括多组分盘加晕模型中的恒星和星际气体（视为具有不同速度弥散的等温组分）以及暗物质晕的引力场，并结合现代观测数据如HI气体标高和IFU巡天、JWST等新观测数据。

Result: 气体和暗物质晕显著影响恒星分布，使其更靠近星系盘面且垂直分布更陡峭，与观测一致。

Abstract: Most of the visible mass in a typical spiral galaxy is distributed in a thin
disk, with a radial extent much larger than its thickness. While the planar
disk structure, including non-axisymmetric features such as spiral structure,
has been studied extensively, the vertical structure has not received
comparable attention. This review aims to give a comprehensive, pedagogic
introduction to the rich topic of vertical structure of a galactic disk in
hydrostatic equilibrium and discuss the theoretical developments in this field
in the context of recent observations. A realistic multi-component disk plus
halo model of a galaxy has been developed and studied by us in detail. This
takes account of both stars and interstellar gas, treated as isothermal
components with different velocity dispersions, which are gravitationally
coupled; further, the disk is in the gravitational field of the dark matter
halo. This review focuses on this model and the results from it in different
physical cases.
  The gas and halo crucially affect the resulting self-consistent stellar
distribution such that it is vertically constrained to be closer to the
mid-plane and has a steeper profile than in the standard one-component case, in
agreement with modern observations. A typical stellar disk is shown to flare by
a factor of few within the visible radial extent of the disk. These robust
results question the sech^2 profile and a constant scale height, routinely used
in the literature, for convenience. In an important application, the observed
HI gas scale height is used as a constraint on the model which helps determine
the shape and the density profile of the dark matter halo for galaxies.
Finally, we outline some key, open questions which can be addressed in the near
future using the above model, and new observational data -- for example, from
IFU surveys and JWST -- for a better understanding of this topic.

### [6] [Photometric analysis of the intracluster light in the TNG300 simulation and wide-field observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02105)
*Daniel Montenegro-Taborda,Vicente Rodriguez-Gomez,Vladimir Avila-Reese,Bernardo Cervantes-Sodi,Matthias Kluge,Aditya Manuwal,Annalisa Pillepich,Lars Hernquist*

**TL;DR**: 比较TNG300模拟与WWFI观测的星系团内光（ICL）光度特性，发现模拟中BCG+ICL的光度分布比观测更广更亮，但多数ICL占比定义下两者中值一致，约为0.3。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究星系团内弥散光（ICL）的光度特性在数值模拟与观测中的一致性。

Data: 数据来源于TNG300磁流体动力学宇宙学模拟和Wendelstein Wide Field Imager (WWFI)观测。

Method: 采用合成图像生成和相同光度测量方法进行模拟与观测数据的直接比较。

Result: TNG300模拟中星系团内光（ICL）的光度分布比观测结果更延伸约两倍且表面亮度高约1等。

Abstract: We present a robust, apples-to-apples comparison between the photometric
properties of the intracluster light (ICL) in the TNG300 magnetohydrodynamic
cosmological simulation and those in Wendelstein Wide Field Imager (WWFI)
observations. This is accomplished by generating synthetic $g'$-band images of
40 massive ($\log\left(M_{\rm 200, crit}/{\rm M}_{\odot}\right) > 14.5$) TNG300
clusters at $z \approx 0.06$, closely mimicking WWFI observations, and then
performing identical photometric calculations on the synthetic and real images.
Importantly, we apply the same observationally motivated satellite-masking
procedure to both data-sets, which effectively removes any possible biases
introduced by the halo finder. We first analyze the light distribution of the
`smooth' stellar component of each cluster, composed of the brightest cluster
galaxy (BCG) plus the ICL, and find that it tends to be about twice as extended
in TNG300 than in observations, while also being approximately 1 $g'$ mag
arcsec$^{-2}$ brighter. We then quantify $f_{\rm ICL}$, the ICL fraction
relative to the BCG+ICL, by considering several ICL definitions: (i) the light
dimmer than a surface brightness cut at 27 $g'$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$, (ii) the
excess light over a de Vaucouleurs profile, (iii) the light beyond twice the
half-light radius ($2 r_{\rm half}$), and (iv) the light beyond a fixed
circular aperture of 30, 50, or 100 kpc. For most definitions, the median
$f_{\rm ICL}$ is consistent between simulation and observations. However, the
observations exhibit larger scatter in $f_{\rm ICL}$, which we attribute
primarily to observational uncertainties in the total BCG+ICL luminosity rather
than `true' cluster-to-cluster variation in the real Universe. We also find
that most methods yield median $f_{\rm ICL}$ values near 0.3, which is
consistent with a BCG/ICL transition radius around $2 r_{\rm half}$.

**TL;DR**: 通过多波段光谱分析发现猎户座星云由外层壳、内层壳和中心高电离气泡构成，外层壳最大膨胀速度为15 km/s，内层壳为27 km/s，且星云外缘的[C II]增强发射源于梯形恒星辐射被中性氢过滤所致。

Background: 探讨猎户座星云的多层结构及其动力学特征。

Data: 数据来源包括 [C II] 158 微米和 HI 21 厘米光谱图像、高速度分辨率的可见光和紫外光谱数据。

Method: 结合[C II] 158微米和HI 21厘米光谱图像以及高速度分辨率光学与紫外光谱进行联合分析。

Result: 猎户座星云的结构由外向内分为外层壳、内层壳和中央高电离气泡，分别具有15 km/s、27 km/s的膨胀速度，且外层壳的[C II]增强发射源于梯形星辐射被中性氢过滤。

Abstract: A study of [C II] 158 micron and HI 21-cm spectroscopic images plus high
velocity resolution optical and ultraviolet spectra has shown the structure of
the Orion Nebula to be different from that found from the study of those data
separately. The [C II] features recently identified as the [C II] Shell is
shown to be part of the Veil-B HI foreground layer. Jointly called the Outer
Shell, it covers the bright Huygens Region and the Extended Orion Nebula. Its
maximum expansion velocity is 15 km/s. Closer to ThetaOne OrionisC there is a
second expanding shell, called the Inner Shell. It has an expansion velocity of
27 km/s and probably results from a more recent period of strong wind from one
or more of the Trapezium stars. Even closer to ThetaOne OrionisC there is a
central high ionization bubble, freely expanding towards the observer but
slowed in the opposite direction by photo-ionized gas coming off the Main
Ionization Front. Utilization of spectroscopic measures of the equivalent width
of Hbeta shows that the enhanced emission in [C II] seen just outside the
visual wavelength boundaries of the Orion Nebula is not caused by
limb-brightening of the Outer Shell. This enhanced emission is due to the
radiation field of the Trapezium stars being filtered by intervening residual
neutral hydrogen. A velocity component near 30 km/s (Heliocentric) first seen
in HI is also present in [C II] and may result from a foreground cloud of the
ISM.

Result: 在核区发现三个致密源，中心源的低光度AGN特征和两个对称排列的恒星形成环支持黑洞超爱丁顿吸积驱动致密风并触发核周环恒星形成的假说。

Abstract: NGC 4527 is a nearby edge-on spiral galaxy with both starburst and AGN
features, hosting a LINER nucleus. We present a radio study of the large-scale
structure and nuclear region of this galaxy, based on new uGMRT observations at
700 and 1230 MHz. Our continuum maps reveal extended emission tracing the
stellar disk, with no evidence of a radio halo. The spectral index distribution
and the presence of PAHs across the disk are consistent with ongoing star
formation. In the nuclear region we resolve three compact sources: one at the
galactic centre and two symmetrically aligned with the major axis at $\sim400$
pc. The spectral index values and the destruction of PAHs in the central
source, together with previously detected X-rays emission, suggest the presence
of a low-luminosity AGN. The two off-centre sources are consistent with a star
formation ring, coincident with a molecular gas ring previously reported. We
explore a scenario where super-Eddington accretion onto the black hole drives a
dense wind that falls back onto the disk, triggering star formation in a
circumnuclear ring.

**TL;DR**: 首次在W51-IRS2中探测到(5,2)和(6,4)氨分子脉泽线，发现45 km s$^{-1}$特征速度漂移减缓或消失，表明振动激发温度与动力学温度一致。


<details>

Background: 研究聚焦于W51-IRS2源中星际氨分子脉泽线的观测特征与激发机制。

Data: 数据来源于2012年至2023年间对W51-IRS2的氨分子脉泽谱线观测，包括首次探测到的（J,K）=（5,2）和（6,4）脉泽线以及（9,6）脉泽发射。

Method: 采用光谱分辨技术分析氨分子脉泽线轮廓及其时间变化特征。

Abstract: W51-IRS2 is known to be one of the most prolific sources of interstellar
ammonia (NH$_3$) maser lines. So far, however, many of these inversion lines
have rarely been studied. Here we report spectrally resolved line profiles for
the majority of detected features and provide information on the variability of
these maser components between 2012 and 2023. This includes the first tentative
detection of a ($J$,$K$) = (5,2) maser in the interstellar medium and the first
tentative detection of a (6,4) maser in W51-IRS2. Furthermore, we report for
the first time NH$_3$ (9,6) maser emission below Local Standard of Rest
velocities of 50 km s$^{-1}$ in this source as well as double maser features
occasionally seen in other transitions. The detected maser lines strongly
indicate vibrational pumping by $\approx$10 $\mu$m photons, which must be
abundant due to the high kinetic temperature ($\approx$300 K) of the ammonia
emitting gas. The detection of vibrationally excited NH$_3$, suggesting a
vibrational excitation temperature consistent with the kinetic one, and a
comparison with measured SiO line profiles is also presented. For the (10,7)
line, we find a tentative correlation between flux density and line width
compatible with unsaturated maser emission. The velocity drift of the so-called
45 km s$^{-1}$ maser features, reported to be +0.2 km s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$
between 1996 and 2012, has either slowed down to values $<$0.1 km s$^{-1}$ or
has entirely disappeared. In 2023, the component is only seen in ammonia
inversion lines that are located at least 800 K above the ground state. The
other features have faded. Possible scenarios explaining this phenomenon are
discussed.

Abstract: The Milky Way Survey of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) has
so far observed three classical dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs): Draco,
Sextans and Ursa Minor. Based on the observed line-of-sight velocities and
metallicities of their member stars, we apply the axisymmetric Jeans
Anisotropic Multi-Gaussian Expansion modeling (JAM) approach to recover their
inner dark matter distributions. In particular, both the traditional
single-population Jeans model and the multiple population chemodynamical model
are adopted. With the chemodynamical model, we divide member stars of each dSph
into metal-rich and metal-poor populations. The metal-rich populations are more
centrally concentrated and dynamically colder, featuring lower velocity
dispersion profiles than the metal-poor populations. We find a diversity of the
inner density slopes $\gamma$ of dark matter halos, with the best constraints
by single-population or chemodynamical models consistent with each other. The
inner density slopes are $0.71^{+0.34}_{-0.35}$, $0.26^{+0.22}_{-0.12}$ and
$0.33^{+0.20}_{-0.16}$ for Draco, Sextans and Ursa Minor, respectively. We also
present the measured astrophysical J and D factors of the three dSphs. Our
results indicate that the study of the dark matter content of dSphs through
stellar kinematics is still subject to uncertainties behind both the
methodology and the observed data, through comparisons with previous
measurements and data sets.

Background: 探讨磁场在大质量恒星形成过程中的调控作用。

Data: 数据来源于JCMT-POL2在850微米波段对13个来自SOFIA Massive（SOMA）恒星形成巡天的大质量恒星形成区域进行的亚毫米偏振观测，共包含29个大质量原恒星。

Method: 采用亚毫米波偏振观测（JCMT-POL2）结合Kuiper检验和蒙特卡洛模拟分析磁场与密度结构取向关系。

Result: 在局部尺度（小于0.6 pc）上，磁场方向与源柱密度延伸方向呈现双峰分布（近平行和近垂直），表明磁场对大质量原恒星核心具有动态重要性。

Abstract: The role of magnetic fields in regulating the formation of massive stars
remains much debated. Here we present sub-millimeter polarimetric observations
with JCMT-POL2 at $850\:\mu$m of 13 regions of massive star formation selected
from the SOFIA Massive (SOMA) star formation survey, yielding a total of 29
massive protostars. Our investigation of the $p'-I$ relationship suggests that
grain alignment persists up to the highest intensities. We examine the relative
orientations between polarization-inferred magnetic field direction and source
column density elongation direction on small and large scales. On small scales,
we find a bimodal distribution of these relative orientations, i.e., with an
excess of near-parallel and near-perpendicular orientations. By applying a
one-sample Kuiper test and Monte Carlo simulations to compare to a relative
orientation distribution drawn from a uniform distribution, we statistically
confirm this bimodal distribution, independent of the methods to measure
structural orientation. This bimodal distribution suggests that magnetic fields
are dynamically important on the local scales ($\lesssim 0.6\:$pc) of massive
protostellar cores. We also examine how basic polarization properties of
overall degree of polarization and local dispersion in polarization vector
orientations depend on intrinsic protostellar properties inferred from spectral
energy distribution (SED) modeling. We find a statistically significant
anti-correlation between the debiased polarized fraction and the luminosity to
mass ratio, $L_{\rm bol}/M_{\rm env}$, which hints at a change in the dust
properties for protostellar objects at different evolutionary stages.

**TL;DR**: 在室女座星系团中发现NGC 4569长达230千秒差距的Hα尾迹，首次完整揭示了剥离星际介质的减速过程及其与星系团速度的同步演化。

Background: 研究星系在星系团内运动时，星际介质因与团内介质相互作用被剥离并形成长尾迹的现象及其动力学演化。

Data: 使用CFHT的VESTIGE项目深空Halpha成像数据进行了初始发现，后续光谱观测采用了APO/DIS、MMT/Binospec和CFHT/SITELLE的数据。

Method: 采用CFHT的Halpha成像数据和APO/DIS、MMT/Binospec、CFHT/SITELLE的光谱观测进行综合分析，并构建简单模型解释剥离气体团的减速过程。

Result: 首次揭示了剥离ISM的完整减速过程，并展示了宽视场Halpha巡天在发现星系团内光学发射线云方面的潜力。

Abstract: Context. Galaxies fly inside galaxy clusters and ram pressure by the ICM can
remove a large amount of the ISM from the galaxy, and deposit the gas in the
ICM. The ISM decoupled from the host galaxy leaves a long trail following the
moving galaxy. Such long trails track the galaxy motion and can be detected
with sensitive data in Halpha.
  Aims. We study the Halpha tail trailing NGC 4569 in the Virgo cluster.
  Methods. The initial discovery was made with the deep Halpha imaging data
with CFHT, from the VESTIGE project. The follow-up spectroscopic observations
were made with APO/DIS, MMT/Binospec and CFHT/SITELLE.
  Results. Besides the known 80 kpc Halpha tail downstream of NGC 4569, the
deep Halpha imaging data allow the Halpha tail detected to at least 230 kpc
from the galaxy. More importantly, the Halpha clumps implied from the imaging
data are confirmed with the spectroscopic data. The Halpha clumps show a smooth
radial velocity gradient across about 1300 km/s, eventually reaching the
velocity of the cluster. We build a simple model to explain the deceleration of
stripped clumps and constrain the age to about 0.9 Gyr.
  Conclusions. This discovery, for the first time, demonstrates the full
deceleration process of the stripped ISM. This discovery also showcases the
potential with wide-field Halpha survey on galaxy clusters to discover
intracluster optical emission-line clouds originated from cluster galaxies.
These clouds provide kinematic tracers to the infall history of cluster
galaxies and the turbulence in the ICM. They are also excellent multi-phase
objects to study the relevant important physical processes.

Abstract: Galaxies moving through the gas of the intracluster medium (ICM) experience
ram pressure stripping, which can leave behind a gas tail. When a disk galaxy
receives the wind edge-on, however, the characteristic signature is not a
typical jellyfish tail, but rather an unwinding of the spiral arms. We aim to
quantify such asymmetries both in the gas and in the stellar component of a
simulated galaxy. To this end, we simulate a gas-rich star-forming spiral
galaxy moving through a self-consistent ICM gas. The amplitude and location of
the asymmetries were measured via Fourier decomposition. We found that the
asymmetry is much more evident in the gas component, but it is also measurable
in the stars. The amplitude tends to increase with time and the asymmetry
radius migrates inwards. We found that, when considering the gas, the spiral
arms extend much further and are more unwound than the corresponding stellar
arms. Characterizing the unwinding via simulations should help inform the
observational criteria used to classify ram pressure stripped galaxies, as
opposed to asymmetries induced by other mechanisms.

Background: 研究聚焦于大质量相互作用双星对星团形成过程中反馈机制的影响及其在星际介质中的作用。

Data: 数据来源于结合了Torch星团形成代码和AMUSE中现有模块（包括碰撞恒星动力学、磁流体力学、机械和辐射反馈模块）的模拟框架，并针对孤立双星和嵌入大质量双星星团在气体介质中的情景进行了模拟。

Result: 双星相互作用反馈显著增强了电离辐射和气体动能，扩大了HII区并改变了其膨胀机制。

Abstract: We present a new framework to incorporate feedback from massive interacting
binaries in simulations of star cluster formation. Our new feedback model adds
binary stellar evolution to the cluster formation code Torch, and couples it in
AMUSE to the pre-existing modules for collisional stellar dynamics,
magnetohydrodynamics, and mechanical and radiative feedback. Our model accounts
for the effects of mass transfer on the stars' mass loss rates, their radiation
spectra, and the timing of core-collapse supernovae. It also injects mass lost
through non-conservative mass transfer and common envelope ejection into the
interstellar medium. We demonstrate the use of our feedback model through
simulations of isolated binaries in a gaseous medium, and of embedded clusters
of massive binaries. Feedback from interacting binaries efficiently couples
with the surrounding interstellar medium. It increases the size of HII regions,
increases the kinetic and thermal energy of the gas, and increases the pressure
within HII regions compared to models that use single star stellar evolution.
Those differences arise from the ionizing radiation, which increases by three
orders of magnitude, resulting in HII regions that expand due to thermal
pressure rather than radiation pressure. The effects of stellar dynamics and
the gravitational potential of the background gas cause the evolution of
individual binaries to deviate from the predictions made by secular evolution,
impacting the subsequent feedback from the binary. We conclude that massive
interacting binaries are an important source of feedback in cluster-forming
regions, and must be considered when studying the emerging timescales of young
star clusters.

### [15] [Discovery and Preliminary Characterization of a Third Interstellar Object: 3I/ATLAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02757)

**TL;DR**: 发现并初步表征了第三颗星际天体候选者3I/ATLAS，其轨道偏心率高、体积约10公里且呈现微弱活动性，估算此类天体的空间数密度约为10⁻³ au⁻³。


<details>

Background: 研究第三个星际天体候选者的特征及其对星际天体空间分布密度的意义。

Data: 数据来源于加拿大-法国-夏威夷望远镜的深度叠加图像、拉斯昆布雷斯天文台0.36米望远镜和2.0米北福克斯望远镜的观测图像。

Result: 发现第三个星际天体候选者3I/ATLAS，其轨道特征和物理性质表明星际天体空间数密度约为10^-3 au^-3。

Abstract: We report initial observations aimed at the characterization of a third
interstellar object candidate. This object, 3I/ATLAS -- also C/2025 N1 (ATLAS)
-- , was discovered on 2025 July 1 UT and has an orbital eccentricity of
$e\sim6.2$, perihelion of $q\sim 1.35$ au, inclination of $\sim175^\circ$, and
hyperbolic velocity of $V_\infty\sim 60$ km s$^{-1}$. 3I/ATLAS has an absolute
magnitude of $H_V\sim12$, which corresponds to a nuclear radius of
$\sim10\text{ km}$, assuming an asteroid-like albedo of $p\sim0.05$. The
discovery of this object implies a spatial number density of $n_0\sim10^{-3}$
au$^{-3}$ for objects with radii greater than or equal to that of 3I/ATLAS. We
report deep stacked images obtained using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope
that display faint activity. Using images obtained from the Las Cumbres
Observatory 0.36 m telescopes at Haleakala and the 2.0 m Faulkes Telescope
North, we find a small light curve variation of less than 0.2 mag for the
object over a $\sim29$ h time span. The visible/near-infrared spectral slope of
the object is red, comparable to 1I/`Oumuamua. The object will be observable
until September 2025, unobservable near perihelion due to low solar elongation,
and observable again in November. This limitation unfortunately prohibits
detailed observations at perihelion when the activity of 3I/ATLAS is likely to
peak. Based on the experience of 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, we ask the
community to maintain a constant observational presence while possible with
photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric methods. Such observational data
would constrain the (i) light curve, (ii) onset and variation of activity, and
(iii) nongravitational effects. It is essential that the community collaborate
to rapidly and comprehensively characterize these properties of 3I/ATLAS.

**TL;DR**: 通过模拟研究验证了Coma、Perseus和Virgo星系团内气体湍流速度与观测值高度一致，发现湍流压力支撑比例较低（Virgo约1%，Perseus和Coma约3-4%），揭示了选择效应对星系团内介质动力学研究的关键影响。

Method: 采用SLOW约束模拟方法生成Coma、Virgo和Perseus星系团的模拟样本进行对比分析。

Result: 模拟的湍流速度和压力支持与XRISM观测结果一致，表明选择效应的重要性。

Abstract: The XRISM Resolve X-ray spectrometer allows to gain detailed insight into gas
motions of the intra cluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters. Current
simulation studies focus mainly on statistical comparisons, making the
comparison to the currently still small number of clusters difficult due to
unknown selection effects. This study aims to bridge this gap, using simulated
counterparts of Coma, Virgo, and Perseus from the SLOW constrained simulations.
These clusters show excellent agreement in their properties and dynamical state
with observations, thus providing an ideal testbed to understand the processes
shaping the properties of the ICM. We find that the simulations match the order
of the amount of turbulence for the three considered clusters, Coma being the
most active, followed by Perseus, while Virgo is very relaxed. Typical
turbulent velocities are a few $\approx100$ km s$^{-1}$, very close to observed
values. The resulting turbulent pressure support is $\approx1\%$ for Virgo and
$\approx 3-4\%$ for Perseus and Coma within the central $1-2\%$ of $R_{200}$.
Compared to previous simulations and observations, measured velocities and
turbulent pressure support are consistently lower, in line with XRISM findings,
thus indicating the importance of selection effects.

**TL;DR**: 基于IllustrisTNG模拟研究发现宇宙细丝宽度随红移演化（0.3至1.5 Mpc），与晕质量和恒星质量密度呈线性相关，密度轮廓符合自相似等温β模型，且气体温度从中心向外缓慢降低。

Method: 采用DisPerSE算法识别宇宙丝状结构，并基于IllustrisTNG模拟数据将丝状体分段测量其宽度和密度分布。

Result: 宇宙丝状结构的典型宽度从红移z=2.0时的约0.3Mpc逐渐增加到z=0.0时的1.0-1.5Mpc。

Abstract: We investigated the widths and profiles of cosmic filaments using the
IllustrisTNG simulations. Filaments were identified with DisPerSE, using galaxy
samples in simulations as input. Since the width of an individual filament can
vary significantly along its spine, we divided each filament into segments with
lengths between $1.5\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and $2.5\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and
measure their properties. The typical width of these filament segments
increases gradually from approximately $0.3\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ at redshift $z =
2.0$ to about $1.0-1.5\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ at $z = 0.0$. We find that the segment
width correlates nearly linearly with the linear halo mass density, consistent
with previous studies. A similar linear relation is observed between the
segment width and the linear stellar mass density, providing a potential
estimator for filament width. Furthermore, the density profiles of filaments
with different widths exhibit self-similarity and can be described by a unified
formula akin to the isothermal $\beta$-model. For segments with a given width,
the rescaled density profiles show only mild evolution from $z = 2.0$ to $z =
0.0$. Within the filament width, the gas temperature decreases slowly from the
center to the boundary, with thicker filaments generally containing hotter gas
than thinner ones. These trends in filament width, density, and thermal
profiles are consistently observed across the TNG50, TNG100, and TNG300
simulations, and align well with results from earlier studies. We briefly
discuss the potential implications and applications of our findings.

Abstract: We investigate the clustering of Lyman-break galaxies at redshifts of 3
$\lesssim z \lesssim$ 5 within the COSMOS field by measuring the angular
two-point correlation function. Our robust sample of $\sim$60,000 bright
($m_{\rm UV}\lesssim 27$) Lyman-break galaxies was selected based on spectral
energy distribution fitting across 14 photometric bands spanning optical and
near-infrared wavelengths. We constrained both the 1- and 2-halo terms at
separations up to 300 arcsec, finding an excess in the correlation function at
scales corresponding to $<20$ kpc, consistent with enhancement due to clumps in
the same galaxy or interactions on this scale. We then performed Bayesian model
fits on the correlation functions to infer the Halo Occupation Distribution
parameters, star formation duty cycle, and galaxy bias in three redshift bins.
We examined several cases where different combinations of parameters were
varied, showing that our data can constrain the slope of the satellite
occupation function, which previous studies have fixed. For an
$M_{\rm{UV}}$-limited sub-sample, we found galaxy bias values of
$b_g=3.18^{+0.14}_{-0.14}$ at $z\simeq3$, $b_g=3.58^{+0.27}_{-0.29}$ at
$z\simeq4$, $b_g=4.27^{+0.25}_{-0.26}$ at $z\simeq5$. The duty cycle values are
$0.62^{+0.25}_{-0.26}$, $0.40^{+0.34}_{-0.22}$, and $0.39^{+0.31}_{-0.20}$,
respectively. These results suggest that, as the redshift increases, there is a
slight decrease in the host halo masses and a shorter timescale for star
formation in bright galaxies, at a fixed rest-frame UV luminosity threshold.

Abstract: We analyze the high-resolution XRISM/Resolve spectrum of the Fe K$\alpha$
emission line of the nearest active galactic nucleus, in Centaurus A. The line
features two narrow and resolved peaks of Fe K$\alpha_1$, and Fe K$\alpha_2$
with a FWHM of $(4.8\pm0.2)\times10^2$ km/s each. A broad line with a FWHM of
$(4.3\pm0.3)\times10^3$ km/s, and with a flux similar to the two narrow line
cores, is also required. This broad component is not observed in the optical or
IR spectra of Cen A. The line shape requires the existence of an emission
region that extends from $\sim10^{-3}$ pc to $\sim10^1$ pc. Assuming that the
emissivity follows a radial power-law profile of $r^{-q}$, we find $q\approx2$.
This may indicate an extended corona, an emitting region that bends towards the
corona, or a non-uniform density. When assuming $q=3$, the line shape can only
be reproduced by including three emitting components in the model. The measured
best-fit inclination is $24^{+13}_{-7}$ degrees, but higher inclinations are
only slightly disfavored. A single blurred MYTorusL line profile can describe
the line shape, but requires a large relative normalization. This could be due
to past variability, modified abundances, or differing geometries. The line
shape can be reproduced from the radii measured by reverberation mapping, but
only if an additional extended emitting region at small radii is included.

Abstract: The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory has detected very high-energy
(VHE) gamma rays from NGC 4278, which is known to host a low-luminosity active
galactic nucleus (AGN). Having only very weak radio jets, the origin of its VHE
gamma rays is unclear. In this paper we first show that NGC 4278 has a massive
molecular cloud surrounding the nucleus by analyzing data taken with the
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We then assume that cosmic ray
protons are accelerated in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow around the
supermassive black hole, which diffuse into the molecular cloud and produce
gamma rays and neutrinos via $pp$ interactions. We model the gamma-ray spectra
and find that the observations can be explained by such hadronic processes if
the AGN activity was higher in the past than at present, and the diffusion
coefficient in the molecular cloud is appreciably smaller than in the Milky Way
interstellar medium. However, we also show that the high-energy neutrinos
co-produced with the gamma rays are unlikely to be detectable even with
IceCube-Gen2.

Abstract: Spherically symmetric accretion incorporating self-gravity constitutes a
three-point boundary value problem (TPBVP) governed by constraints at the outer
boundary, sonic point, and accretor surface. Previous studies have two
limitations: either employing an incorrect formula for self-gravity potential
in analytical treatments, or introducing additional input parameters in
numerical implementations to circumvent solving the full TPBVP. To address
these issues, we present a self-consistent TPBVP formulation, solved using the
relaxation method. We also derive approximate analytical formulae that enable
rapid estimates of self-gravity effects. Our analysis identifies a
dimensionless parameter $\beta \equiv 2G \bar{\rho}
r_\mathrm{out}^2/a_\mathrm{out}^2$ that characterizes the strength of
self-gravity, where $\bar{\rho}$ and $r_\mathrm{out}$ are the mean density and
outer radius of the flow, respectively, and $a_\mathrm{out}$ is the adiabatic
sound speed of the external medium. For practical estimation, $\bar{\rho}$ may
be approximated by the external medium density $\rho_\mathrm{out}$. We identify
an upper limit for $\beta$, beyond which steady accretion becomes unsustainable
-- a behavior consistent with classical gravitational instability that previous
studies failed to capture. The accretion rate enhancement decreases
monotonically as the adiabatic index $\gamma$ increases. For $\gamma=5/3$,
self-gravity ceases to augment the accretion rate. These theoretical
predictions are validated by our numerical solutions. We further apply our
results to two astrophysical scenarios: hyper-Eddington accretion onto
supermassive black hole seeds in the early Universe, where self-gravity is
significant; and accretion onto stellar-mass objects embedded in active
galactic nuclei (AGN) disks, where self-gravity is non-negligible under certain
conditions and should be evaluated using $\beta$.

models, constrained by astrometric, interferometric, and spectroscopic
observations. However, they are not available for distant stars. Instead, we
focused on the nearest massive stars in the Orion Belt. We obtained VLTI
interferometric observations of Orion Belt stars and calibrated visibility data
from the GRAVITY and PIONIER instruments. Additionally, we obtained
spectroscopic data from the CFHT and CTIO observatories. For modelling, we used
a modified version of PHOEBE2, extended with new interferometric and
spectroscopic modules. To describe non-spherical, rotating, or Roche-like
stars, integrals over triangular meshes have to be computed, using extensive
grids of synthetic spectra. For fitting, we used the simplex algorithm and chi2
mapping of the parameter space. In this paper, we present single-star models of
the B0Ia supergiant eps Ori. Interferometric visibilities indicate that the
star is not spherical but rotating close to its critical velocity. The
preferred distance, d=(384+-8)pc, corresponds to the median of distances for
the Orion OB1b association. We obtained the following parameters:
m=(28.4+-2.0)Msol, R=(27.6+-1.5)Rsol, Teff=25000 K, i=45deg, longitude of the
ascending node, Omega=300deg, and Prot=4.3+1.0d. This compromise model provides
a reasonable fit to wind-free Balmer line profiles, but there is still some
tension between interferometric and spectroscopic datasets, corresponding to a
faster- vs. slower-rotating star. Our fast-rotating model implies that
circumstellar matter should be naturally present, in the form of wind or disk,
and contribute to continuum radiation. The fast rotation of eps Ori is
compatible with a merger, formed from a multiple system of comparable mass,
like del, zet or sig Ori.
