We do not find evidence for spurious disruption of galaxies due\nto insufficient resolution for the satellite masses we consider. By contrast,\nthe stripping of stellar mass is strongly resolution-dependent: each factor of\n8 improvement in particle stellar mass typically adds 2~Gyr to the stripping\ntime. Improved numerical resolution within the IllustrisTNG model generally\nresults in more compact satellites with larger stellar masses, which in turn\ngenerate more centrally concentrated stellar haloes and intra-cluster mass\nprofiles.

This makes them particularly well suited\nto studying the intragroup medium (IGrM), where traditional probes such as\nX-ray emission and the SZ effect are weak. Evidence suggests that the baryon\ncontent of group mass halos ($M_{500}\\sim10^{13}-10^{14}$ M$_{\\odot}$) is\nstrongly affected by galactic feedback, creating deviations from cluster\nscaling relations. Three FRBs from the first CHIME/FRB Outrigger sample come\nfrom host galaxies found within or behind galaxy clusters and groups. Using\nintegrated halo density models, we estimate the DM contribution of each\nICM/IGrM, accounting for uncertainties in halo mass and the distance to the\nhost galaxy relative to the cluster center. For the more massive halos,\npredicted cluster DMs agree with the extragalactic DM budget. One burst, FRB\n20230703A, intersects three groups yet has a low extragalactic DM. By comparing\nmodel predictions with the measured DM, we constrain the baryon fraction\n$f_g(R)$ in these halos. Comparing with published $M-f_g$ relations, we find\nconsistency with recent eROSITA results at $R_{500}$, mild tension at\n$R_{200}$, and strong tensions with earlier X-ray-based relations. As CHIME/FRB\nOutriggers build a large catalog of localized FRBs, many additional sightlines\nthrough groups and clusters will be obtained. These will enable systematic\ntests of intragroup and intracluster gas properties and sharpen constraints on\nthe distribution of baryons in massive halos."}

In this\nsecond paper, we introduce a multi-probe mass modelling approach that\nincorporates constraints on both the total mass and the individual baryonic\ncomponents. We obtain comprehensive mass models of Abell S1063, in which the\ndark matter distribution is disentangled from the baryonic mass at both cluster\nand galaxy scales. The best-fitting mass model achieves an RMS of $0.50\"$ on\nthe multiple image positions. The kinematic profiles of the BCG \\& ICL, as well\nas the X-ray surface brightness of the intra-cluster gas, are accurately\nreproduced within observational uncertainties. However, a $35~\\mathrm{km/s}$\nscatter is required for the cluster member line-of-sight dispersions.

Approximately 650 clouds in our\ncatalog are associated with the boundary of the Local Bubble, while around 740\nclouds (excluding those associated with the Local Bubble) are located at high\nGalactic latitudes ($|b| > 20^\\circ$). The spatial distribution of the\ncataloged clouds reveals prominent large-scale features in the Galactic disk,\nincluding coherent spur-like structures, large-scale cavities, and a more\ndetailed view of the Local Bubble shell. These findings refine our\nunderstanding of how molecular clouds trace the Galactic spiral arm network and\nprovide new insight into the spatial structure of the Local Bubble. The catalog\nserves as a valuable resource for future studies of star formation, Galactic\nstructure, and the interaction between molecular clouds and large-scale ISM\nfeatures."}

The 3x2pt analysis combines galaxy clustering from\nthe lens galaxy sample and weak gravitational lensing. The redshift\ndistributions are inferred using the SOMPZ method - a Self-Organizing Map\nframework that combines deep-field multi-band photometry, wide-field data, and\na synthetic source injection (Balrog) catalog. Key improvements over the DES\nYear 3 (Y3) calibration include a noise-weighted SOM metric, an expanded Balrog\ncatalogue, and an improved scheme for propagating systematic uncertainties,\nwhich allows us to generate O($10^8$) redshift realizations that collectively\nspan the dominant sources of uncertainty. These realizations are then combined\nwith independent clustering-redshift measurements via importance sampling. The\nresulting calibration achieves typical uncertainties on the mean redshift of\n1-2%, corresponding to a 20-30% average reduction relative to DES Y3. We\ncompress the $n(z)$ uncertainties into a small number of orthogonal modes for\nuse in cosmological inference.

This tension between numerical models and observations\ncan be either due to our underlying cosmological models or due to a gap in our\nunderstanding of early Universe astrophysics. In a prelude to this letter, we\nshowed how the Renaissance simulations, which focused on high redshift galaxy\nformation were able to reconstruct similar stellar masses to the earliest and\nhighest mass galaxies that had been discovered by JWST at the time of its\npublication (McCaffrey et al.2023). Since then many more galaxies have been\ndiscovered by JWST, in particular the \"Mirage-or-Miracle\" (MoM) survey broke\nthe record recently with the highest redshift galaxy MoM-z14, which has a\nspectroscopically confirmed redshift of $z \\sim 14.44$ followed closely by\nGS-z14 with a spectroscopically confirmed redshift of $z \\sim 14.3$. We\ninvestigate in this letter whether these newly discovered galaxies are in\nconflict with the Renaissance simulations and thus whether they are causing\ntension with our established models of cosmology and/or high-redshift\nastrophysics.

Our results\nsuggest that GJ 436 b formed at ~ 0.3 AU and, despite its current substantial\natmospheric erosion, has experienced minimal cumulative mass loss throughout\nits history, thanks to a late inward migration triggered by a distant companion\ninducing ZLK oscillations. We find that initial mutual inclinations of 80{\\deg}\n- 100{\\deg} with this companion best reproduce the observed polar orbit.

One of the most intensively examined models is that of perfect fluids,\nwhich have been used extensively to describe compact objects such as stars, as\nwell as being of cosmological interest. However, neutron stars are believed to\npossess an elastic crust, thus departing from a perfect fluid body, and\ncritical collapse with elastic materials is an entirely unexplored topic. In\nthis work, we employ a scale-invariant elastic matter model to study\nself-similar collapse with elasticity. As with perfect fluid models, we show\nthat including elasticity allows for continuous self-similar configurations,\nwhich we determine numerically by solving the associated boundary value\nproblem. The set of solutions is discrete and we focus on the fundamental mode,\nbut also present some results for overtones. Similarly to the perfect fluid\ncase, the existence of a sonic point plays a central role. We find that the\naddition of elasticity, by either increasing the shear index $\\mathrm{s}$ or\ndecreasing the Poisson ratio $\\nu$, leads to an increase in compressibility and\ncan yield negative radial pressures around the sonic point. Simultaneously, the\nelastic longitudinal wave speed ceases to be constant, while the two possible\ntransverse wave speeds grow further apart. The departure from the perfect fluid\ncase can be so dramatic as to generate a second sonic point, which does not\nseem to be regular. This, in turn, imposes bounds on the elasticity parameters\nof the material. This study represents the first step in the analysis of\ncritical collapse with elastic materials."}

Given their large amplitude (7-9 mag), {only those} brighter than\n$17.5$ mag at outburst maximum are expected to have an r-band quiescence\ncounterpart in individual scans. Thanks to the planned cadence of the LSST\ntowards the Galactic center, ~70% of the simulated outbursts will be detected\ntwice or more on the discovery night, and two-thirds will be observed in\ndifferent bands. CVs of the Polar class, which display luminosity changes up to\n4 mag, can be unbiasedly recovered to 22.5 mag with more than 100 detections\nover 10 years of the LSST operation. Finally, we attempt to characterize the\ndetection rate of micronovae bursts, and find that about 2.6%} of the simulated\nsample will be observed as a >= 0.4 mag-amplitude and <= 1-d duration spike in\nthe long-term light curve. Overall, our results consolidate LSST's capability\nto studying time-domain phenomena in CVs, and inform on how to plan and\norganize follow-up observation strategies on transients discovered by LSST."}

Since gravity provides the\nweakest interactions the result provides a plausible floor on the rate of\nprimordial decoherence. Previous calculations (arXiv:2211.11046) did so using\nonly a subset of these interactions, motivated by assuming both system and\nenvironment were super-Hubble. We extend this by including the effects on\nsuper-Hubble modes of {\\it all} gravitational interactions at leading order in\nH/Mp (and so need not restrict the decohering environment to being\nsuper-Hubble). We show how the decohering evolution becomes Markovian for\nsuper-Hubble modes, without the need to appeal to truncations (like the\n`rotating wave' approximation) that are often used in optics but can be\ninapprorpriate for cosmology. We find that the dominant contribution comes from\nthe nonlocal cubic interactions obtained by solving the constraints. We\nidentify UV divergences systematically and verify thereby that the leading part\nof the purity evolution is UV finite. In the end we find a decoherence rate\nthat grows in the super-Hubble regime significantly {\\it faster} than found\nearlier. We take the preliminary steps to resum this result to late times and\nbriefly discuss why they are more complicated than for earlier calculations."}

On time scales beyond a few\nrotation periods, these light curves are typically stochastic. The variability\narises from a combination of accretion rate changes, line-of-sight extinction\nvariations, and evolving spotted stellar surfaces. We aim to develop a\nmethodology to quantitatively compare the full variability statistics of these\ninhomogeneously sampled light curves with model calculations. To achieve this,\nwe converted the light curves into variability fingerprints. They map the\nprobability of variation by a given amount over a given timescale. Applying\nprincipal component analysis to these fingerprints produces a stable\ndistribution of the first two principal components. We show that this\ndistribution is a continuum without clusters. Adding a model-generated\nfingerprint to an observational sample does not significantly alter the\ndistribution of the sample, allowing a robust comparison between the model and\nobserved light curves to assess statistical realism. We show that photometric\nuncertainties, timing, and observing cadence have a minimal impact on model\nplacement within the observational distribution. The main source of variance\namong highly variable light curves of young stars is the timescale of the onset\nof significant variability (above 0.3mag), with 1-3month timescales being the\nmost critical.

We explain the anti-tail as an anisotropic extension of the snow\nline, or survival radius of a sublimating ice grain, in the direction of the\nSun. The anisotropy is due to the difference in the sublimation mass flux in\nthe solar and perpendicular directions caused by the change in the illumination\nangle of the cometary surface. The stronger sublimation mass flux in the solar\ndirection results in ice grains with larger sizes, longer sublimation\nlifetimes, and a snow line at a larger radial distance with respect to other\ndirections.
