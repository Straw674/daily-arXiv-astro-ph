### [1] [Gas meets Kozai: the influence of a gas-rich accretion disc on hierarchical triples undergoing von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23889)
*Yubo Su,Connar Rowan,Mor Rozner*

**TL;DR**: 研究探讨了在活动星系核（AGN）环境中，双星系统在倾斜轨道上受气体盘和von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai（ZLK）效应影响的演化过程，发现其轨道分离可能从逐渐硬化转变为快速软化，并可能促进恒星合并和引力波源的形成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 活动星系核（AGN）由中心超大质量黑洞（SMBH）和周围高密度的气体盘及核星团组成，其中的双星系统可被视为三体系统（SMBH作为第三体），其动力学行为受气体盘相互作用影响。现有研究尚未充分探讨倾斜轨道上双星系统的演化及其对恒星合并和引力波源形成的潜在影响。

Data: 研究基于理论模型，未明确提及具体观测数据。

Method: 通过理论分析，研究了双星系统在倾斜轨道上的演化，考虑了von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai（ZLK）效应和气体盘的拖曳力作用。

Result: 研究发现，随着外轨道倾角减小，双星系统的轨道分离可能从逐渐硬化转变为快速软化，且最小近心距减小；这种相互作用可能促进恒星合并和引力波源的形成，结果适用于其他富含气体的分层三体系统。

Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) consist of a central supermassive black hole
(SMBH) embedded in a region with both high gas and stellar densities: the gas
is present as a thin accretion disc that fuels the central SMBH, while the
stars form a dense, roughly isotropic nuclear star cluster. The binaries
present in such a cluster could be considered naturally as triples, with the
SMBH as a third object, and their dynamics also depend on the interaction with
the gas-rich disc. In this paper, we study the evolution of such a binary on an
inclined orbit with respect to the disc. The binary experiences both
eccentricity excitation via the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect and drag
forces from each time it penetrates the disc. We find that, as the outer
orbital inclination decreases, the evolution of inner orbital separation can
transition from a regime of gradual hardening to a regime of rapid softening.
As such binaries grow wider, their minimum pericentre distances (during ZLK
oscillations) decrease. We show that a simple geometric condition, modulated by
the complex ZLK evolution, dictates whether a binary expands or contracts due
to the interactions with the AGN disc. Our results suggest that the interaction
with gas-rich accretion disc could enhance the rate of stellar mergers and
formation of gravitational wave sources, as well as other transients. The
treatment introduced here is general and could apply, with the proper
modifications, to hierarchical triples in other gas-rich systems.

### [2] [The Density Distribution of Compressively-Forced Supersonic Turbulence Depends on the Driving Correlation Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23898)
*Philipp Grete,Evan Scannapieco,Marcus Brüggen,Liubin Pan*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过高分辨率模拟和示踪粒子分析了压缩驱动湍流中驱动加速度相关时间对密度波动演化的影响，发现相关时间与涡旋翻转时间的比例显著影响低密度空洞的形成和密度分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 超音速湍流在天体物理系统中起关键作用，但驱动加速度的相关时间对其影响的研究较少，尤其是在压缩驱动湍流中。

Data: 高分辨率模拟和示踪粒子数据。

Method: 使用高分辨率模拟和示踪粒子分析密度波动的演化，包括对数密度PDF及其变化率的条件统计。

Result: 当驱动相关时间与涡旋翻转时间相当时，压缩驱动会形成大低密度空洞，导致密度分布更宽且偏斜；而当相关时间较短时，则不形成此类空洞，密度分布更窄且偏斜较小。

Abstract: Supersonic turbulence plays a critical role in shaping astrophysical systems,
from molecular clouds to the circumgalactic medium. Key properties of this
turbulence include the Mach number, driving scale, and nature of the driving
mechanism, which can be solenoidal (divergence-free), compressive (curl-free),
or a mix of the two. A less studied property is the correlation time of the
driving accelerations, $\tau_{\rm a}.$ While this timescale has a minimal
impact on solenoidally-driven turbulence, we show that it has a strong impact
on compressively-driven turbulence. Using high-resolution simulations with
tracer particles, we analyze the evolution of density fluctuations, focusing on
the PDF of the logarithmic density, $s$, and its rate of change,
$\frac{ds}{dt},$ and the conditional statistics of $\frac{ds}{dt}$ and
$\frac{d^2s}{dt^2}$. When the driving correlation time is comparable to the
eddy turnover time, $\tau_{\rm a} \approx \tau_{\rm e},$ compressive driving
leads to the formation of large, low-density voids in which the variance of
$\frac{ds}{dt}$ is large. These are directly linked to sustained accelerated
expansions, which results in a strong correlation between density and the
divergence of the driving acceleration field. In contrast, when $\tau_{\rm a}
\approx 0.1 \, \tau_{\rm e}$, compressive driving does not produce such voids,
resulting in a narrower, less skewed distribution. We show using analytical
estimates that $\tau_{\rm a}$ is may be significantly less than $\tau_{\rm e}$
in supernova-driven turbulence, highlighting the need to better understand the
role of the driving correlation time in shaping the density structure of
turbulent astrophysical systems.

### [3] [The Dipole Instability in Gravitational $N$-body Systems: A Natural Explanation for Lopsidedness and Off-Centered Nuclei in Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23905)
*Shashank Dattathri,Frank C. van den Bosch,Martin D. Weinberg,Uddipan Banik*

**TL;DR**: 研究了具有双幂律密度分布的球对称自引力系统的稳定性，发现快速过渡的密度分布会导致分布函数出现拐点，引发旋转偶极模的不稳定性，最终形成长期存在的孤子结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域关注球对称自引力系统的稳定性，尤其是密度分布函数的特性及其对系统动力学的影响。现有研究指出，分布函数的拐点可能违反稳定性判据，但具体机制和后果尚不明确。

Data: 使用了高分辨率的N体模拟数据。

Method: 通过高分辨率N体模拟分析了密度分布函数的拐点对系统稳定性的影响，并研究了旋转偶极模的演化过程。

Result: 研究发现密度分布函数的拐点会驱动旋转偶极模的不稳定性，导致中心密度尖峰移动并形成长期存在的孤子结构，同时探讨了其与星系偏心核的潜在联系。

Abstract: We explore the stability of isotropic, spherical, self-gravitating systems
with a double-power law density profile. Systems with rapid transitions between
the inner and outer slopes are shown to have an inflection in their isotropic
distribution function (DF), where ${\rm d} f/{\rm d} E > 0$, thereby violating
Antonov's stability criterion. Using high-resolution $N$-body simulations, we
show that the resulting instability causes the growth of a rotating dipole (or
$l=1$) mode. The inflection feature in the DF responds to the mode by promoting
its growth, driving the instability. The growth of the dipole results in a
torque that dislodges the original cusp from its central location, and sets it
in motion throughout the central region. Once the mode goes non-linear, it
saturates, together with the cusp, into a long-lived soliton (the $l=1$
equivalent of a bar in a disk galaxy), which maintains its sloshing motion
through the center of the halo along a slowly precessing, elliptical orbit.
Concurrently, the soliton traps increasingly more particles into libration, and
the exchange of energy and angular momentum with these trapped particles works
towards eroding the bump in the distribution function. We point out
similarities between the dipole mode and the bump-on-tail instability in
electrostatic plasmas, and highlight a potential connection with core stalling
and dynamical buoyancy in systems with a cored density profile. Finally, we
discuss the astrophysical implications in terms of lopsidedness and off-center
nuclei in galaxies.

### [4] [The role of bars in triggering active galactic nuclei galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23958)
*V. Marels,V. Mesa,M. Jaque Arancibia,S. Alonso,G. Coldwell,G. Damke,V. Contreras Rojas*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过比较不同环境中棒状和非棒状星系的活动星系核（AGN）比例，发现棒状星系倾向于拥有更高比例的强AGN，且棒状结构的显著性与核活动增强相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 棒状结构被认为是将气体输送到星系中心区域的有效机制，可能增强核活动，但棒状结构对活动星系核（AGN）的影响程度及其效率是否随环境变化尚不明确。

Data: 研究使用了Galaxy Zoo DECaLS目录中的样本，并利用斯隆数字巡天（SDSS）的光谱数据识别了1330个棒状AGN和1651个非棒状AGN。

Method: 通过比较棒状和非棒状星系中AGN的比例，并使用[OIII]5007光度（Lum[OIII]）和吸积率参数R作为核活动的指标，区分强和弱AGN。

Result: 分析表明，棒状星系倾向于拥有更高比例的强AGN，且棒状结构的显著性与核活动增强相关，特别是在低密度和高密度环境中。

Abstract: Bars are considered an efficient mechanism for transporting gas toward the
central regions of galaxies, potentially enhancing nuclear activity. However,
the extent to which bars influence active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and whether
their efficiency varies with environment, remain open questions. In this study,
we aim to quantify the role of bars in triggering AGNs by comparing the AGN
fraction in barred and non-barred galaxies across different environments. We
constructed a sample from the Galaxy Zoo DECaLS catalog, ensuring a control
selection where both samples share similar distributions in stellar mass,
redshift, magnitude, concentration index, and local density parameter. AGNs
were identified using spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,
yielding 1330 barred AGNs and 1651 unbarred AGNs. We use the [OIII]5007
luminosity (Lum[OIII]) and the accretion rate parameter R as indicators of
nuclear activity. Based on these, we applied criteria to distinguish powerful
from weak AGNs, allowing a more precise assessment of the bar's impact on the
supermassive black hole. Our analysis reveals that barred galaxies tend to host
a higher fraction of powerful AGNs. From Lum[OIII], we find that more active
nuclei reside in massive, blue galaxies with young stellar populations. We also
observe a slight tendency for barred galaxies to host less massive black holes
accreting more efficiently. The classification of strong and weak bars shows
that more prominent bars correlate with higher nuclear activity. While this
trend shows no significant differences in intermediate-density environments, it
becomes evident in both low- and high-density regions, where galaxies with
strong bars show enhanced AGN activity.

### [5] [Towards an observationally motivated AGN dusty torus model -- II. The roles of density distribution and chemical composition of the dust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23981)
*Omar Ulises Reyes-Amador,Omaira González-Martín,Jacopo Fritz,Maarten Baes,Sundar Srinivasan,Ismael García-Bernete,Donaji Esparza-Arredondo,Marko Stalevski*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过辐射传输模拟探讨了尘埃分布和化学组成对活动星系核（AGN）中红外（MIR）光谱能量分布（SEDs）的影响，发现不同尘埃分布和组成显著影响光谱形状和硅酸盐特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 现有文献中提出了多种活动星系核（AGN）中核尘埃的模型，通常假设尘埃密度分布是导致AGN中红外（MIR）发射差异的主要因素。

Data: 使用了68个AGN的观测MIR光谱数据。

Method: 通过辐射传输模拟生成并分析了合成SED库，比较了平滑、团块和两相尘埃分布，以及两种尘埃化学组成（ISM尘埃和Reyes-Amador等人（2024）的氧化物/硅酸盐组成）。

Result: 研究发现尘埃密度分布和化学组成显著影响光谱形状和硅酸盐特征，平滑分布产生更强的硅酸盐吸收特征，团块分布产生更强的发射特征，而两相分布则表现出中间特性。ISM尘埃组成更适合再现观测特征，而Reyes-Amador等人（2024）的组成在某些条件下对Type-1和Type-2 SEDs有更好的拟合效果。

Abstract: Several models of nuclear dust in active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been
presented in the literature to determine its physical and geometrical
properties, usually assuming the dust density distribution as the main aspect
producing differences in the mid-infrared (MIR) emission of AGNs. We present a
study of the MIR emission of nearby AGNs by exploring the effects of dust
distribution and chemical composition on the spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) using radiative transfer simulations. Our model grid includes smooth,
clumpy, and two-phase dust distributions, combined with two dust compositions:
the interstellar medium (ISM) dust composition including large grains (up to
$\rm{10 \ \mu m}$), and the oxide/silicate-based composition from Reyes-Amador
et al. (2024). A synthetic SED library was generated and analysed both on a
model-to-model basis and with observed MIR spectra from 68 AGNs. We found that
dust density distribution and dust composition significantly influence the
spectral shapes and silicate features at $10$ and $\rm{18 \ \mu m}$, especially
at edge-on orientations. The smooth distribution produces stronger and broader
silicate absorption features, while the clumpy distribution generates stronger
features in emission. The two-phase distributions exhibit intermediate
characteristics depending on the clumpiness fraction ($f_{\text{cl}}$) and
filling factor ($f_{\text{fill}}$). The ISM dust composition with large grains
is more suited to reproduce the observed features and a higher fraction of good
fits, particularly with Type-2 SEDs, independently of dust density
distributions. The Reyes-Amador et al. (2024) composition provides a larger
number of good fits with Type-1 SEDs for $f_{\text{cl}} \leq 0.5$, and with
Type-2 SEDs for $f_{\text{cl}} \geq 0.9$. This work shows that no single dust
distribution or composition reproduces all observations.

### [6] [The Impact of Galaxy Overdensities and Ionized Bubbles on Ly$α$ Emission $z\sim7.0\mbox{--}8.5$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24080)
*Zuyi Chen,Daniel P. Stark,Charlotte A. Mason,Mengtao Tang,Lily Whitler,Michael W. Topping*

**TL;DR**: 利用JWST对292个红移7.0-8.5的星系进行Lyα光谱分析，发现强Lyα发射星系集中在密度过高的区域，支持了再电离时期离子化气泡大小的理论预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 再电离时期的离子化气泡大小理论预测为0.6-1.5 pMpc（红移7附近，中性氢分数为0.5-0.7），本研究通过JWST观测验证这一预测。

Data: 使用JWST观测了5个天区的292个红移7.0-8.5的星系，覆盖了1.3×10^6 Mpc^3的共动体积。

Method: 通过NIRCam光栅和NIRSpec获取红移数据，分析Lyα发射和星系密度分布。

Result: 在292个星系中检测到36个Lyα发射星系，其中9个是新发现的；13个显著的星系密度过高区域被发现，强Lyα发射星系几乎全部位于这些区域，支持了离子化气泡大小的理论预测。EGS天区的一个24 pMpc视线可能已完全电离，这与标准再电离模型存在矛盾。

Abstract: Ly$\alpha$ spectroscopy with {\it JWST} is opening a new window on the sizes
of ionized bubbles through the reionization epoch. Theoretical expectations
suggest typical bubble radii should be 0.6--1.5 pMpc at $z\simeq 7$, assuming
neutral hydrogen fractions of the intergalactic medium in the range
$\overline{x}_{\rm HI}$=0.5--0.7. Here we investigate this picture using {\it
JWST} to characterize the environment and Ly$\alpha$ emission of 292 galaxies
at $7.0<z<8.5$ across 5 fields spanning a comoving volume of $1.3\times10^6$
Mpc$^3$. If the reionization predictions are correct, we should see
overdensities and strong Ly$\alpha$ emission clustered in redshift windows of
d$z=0.04-0.08$ and angular scales of 5--11 arcmin. We detect Ly$\alpha$
emission in 36 out of 292 galaxies, including nine new Ly$\alpha$ detections,
two of which (in the UDS field) show extremely large equivalent widths (EW =
$200_{-78}^{+50}$ A and $284_{-75}^{+56}$ A). We identify 13 significant
(4--11$\times$) galaxy overdensities using redshifts from NIRCam grism and
NIRSpec. Strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters are almost uniformly found in the
overdensities, with nearly all located between the center and back of the
structures. The overdensities that host the strong Ly$\alpha$ emitters span
typical line-of-sight distances (d$z\sim 0.14$) and angular scales ($\sim 8$
arcmin) that are comparable to the predicted bubble sizes at $z\simeq 7$. We
discuss evidence that the EGS is mostly ionized along a 24 pMpc sightline at
$z\simeq 7.0-7.6$, based on the presence of 3 overdense structures and 10
Ly$\alpha$ emitters in this volume, and find such a large ionized region would
pose tension with standard reionization models.

*E. Wisnioski,J. T. Mendel,R. Leaman,T. Tsukui,H. Übler,N. M. Förster Schreiber*

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过整合光学/近红外积分场光谱和亚毫米干涉测量数据，分析了近千个红移大于0.5的星系中电离和分子气体的运动，发现电离气体速度弥散度比分子气体高约2倍，且结果对分子气体示踪剂敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 目前对星系盘结构和运动学演化的研究存在技术和方法上的异质性，导致不同动力学示踪剂（如Hα、[CII]、CO）的结果不一致。

Data: 研究使用了237个红移在0.5到8之间的星系盘的速度弥散度和旋转速度测量数据，其中63个星系有分子气体分数的测量数据。

Method: 研究整合了光学/近红外积分场光谱和亚毫米干涉测量数据，并基于Toomre稳定性模型分析了不同相态的速度弥散度。

Result: 研究发现电离气体速度弥散度比分子气体高约2倍，且[CII]示踪剂的结果显示出混合行为，表明其多相起源。当考虑恒星形成率时，[CII]的运动学可以与分子和电离气体示踪剂的结果一致。

Abstract: Together optical/near infrared integral field spectroscopy and resolved
sub-millimetre interferometry data have mapped the ionised and molecular gas
motions in nearly one thousand galaxies at redshifts $z>0.5$. While these
measurements have revealed a number of key properties about the evolution of
disc structure and kinematics, heterogenous techniques and samples have led to
disparate findings - especially when comparing different dynamical tracers
(e.g., H$\alpha$, [C$\scriptstyle\rm~II$], CO). In this paper we present a
literature compilation of 237 disc galaxies with measurements of velocity
dispersion and rotational velocity between $z=0.5-8$, a subset of 63 galaxies
have measurements of molecular gas fractions. We explore the connection between
disc velocity dispersion measurements over 8 Gyrs as traced by multiple phases
with the expectations from Toomre stability models. When sample properties are
taken into account (e.g., stellar mass, tracer) there is little evolution in
disc dispersions between $z\sim1.5-8$, consistent with expectations from model
assumptions. We find ionised gas dispersions are higher by $\sim2\times$ from
molecular gas dispersions at a fixed gas mass. These results are sensitive to
the molecular gas tracer with results from [C$\scriptstyle\rm~II$] showing
mixed behaviour indicative of its multi-phase origin. The
[C$\scriptstyle\rm~II$] kinematics can be reconciled with molecular and ionised
gas tracers when star-formation rates are taken into account.

### [8] [Major Mergers Mean Major Offset: Drivers of Intrinsic Scatter in The $M_{GCS}-M_h$ Scaling Relation for Massive Elliptical Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24154)
*Veronika Dornan,William E. Harris*

**TL;DR**: 本研究确定了27个极高质量椭圆星系的总球状星团（GC）计数和球状星团系统（GCS）总质量估计，并验证了GCS-晕质量关系的1:1斜率在最高质量星系中仍然成立。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域关注球状星团系统（GCS）与星系晕质量之间的关系，尤其是极高质量椭圆星系中这一关系的表现。现有研究已覆盖较广的晕质量范围，但对最高质量星系的研究仍存在不足。

Data: 研究使用了哈勃太空望远镜（HST）在近红外波段拍摄的图像，通过DOLPHOT进行测光分析，获取了27个极高质量椭圆星系的球状星团二维空间分布数据。

Method: 采用了一种基于Voronoi镶嵌的技术，从二维空间分布数据中确定了球状星团系统的径向密度分布，并将这些星系与文献中已研究的星系一起绘制在GCS-晕质量关系图中。

Result: 研究发现GCS-晕质量关系的1:1斜率在最高质量星系中仍然成立，但极高质量BCG星系的GCS质量高于其低质量星系对应物。此外，发现高偏移值与GCS密度分布陡峭度之间存在负相关，且主要由红色球状星团驱动。

Abstract: In this work we determine the total globular cluster (GC) counts and globular
cluster system (GCS) total mass estimates for 27 extremely massive elliptical
galaxies. The GC 2D spatial distributions of these galaxies were created from
photometry of HST images using DOLPHOT in the near-IR wavelength range. The
projected radial density profiles of these GCSs were determined using a Voronoi
tessellation-based technique introduced in our previous paper. We then plot
these galaxies on the GCS - halo mass relation alongside previously studied
galaxies in the literature. The relation now extends across seven decades of
halo mass. We find that the 1:1 slope of this relation holds out to the highest
mass galaxies, although extremely massive BCG galaxies are shifted to higher
GCS masses than their lower-mass galaxy counterparts. We find a negative
correlation with massive galaxies' offset from the GCS - halo mass relation and
the steepness of their GCS density profiles, and that this is being driven by
the red GC populations. We suggest that the biggest influence in intrinsic
scatter in the GCS - halo mass relation for massive galaxies is through a few
major mergers resulting in accretion of massive satellites with old, red GC
populations, rather than many accretions of small satellites with younger, blue
GC populations.

### [9] [Discovery of the Hybrid Response of Photoionized Gases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24242)
*Zhicheng He,Tinggui Wang,Gary J. Ferland*

**TL;DR**: 研究发现光致电离气体中存在第三种响应模式——混合响应，揭示了电离率、复合率和离子柱密度之间的异步性导致的边界错位现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 光致电离气体在宇宙中普遍存在，其离子浓度通常表现出两种响应模式：低电离态的正响应和高电离态的负响应。

Data: 未明确提及具体数据来源，但通过时间依赖的光致电离模拟进行了研究。

Method: 采用了时间依赖的光致电离模拟方法。

Result: 发现了第三种响应模式——混合响应，揭示了电离率、复合率和离子柱密度之间的异步性导致的边界错位现象，增加了气体性质解释的复杂性。

Abstract: Photoionized gases are prevalent throughout the universe. In such gases, the
ion concentration typically exhibits two response modes to radiation: a
positive response in the low-ionization state and a negative response in the
high-ionization state. Here, we report the discovery of a widespread
misalignment at the boundary between the above two response modes, and identify
a third mode-the hybrid response-through time-dependent photoionization
simulations. This phenomenon arises from the asynchrony among the ionization
rate, recombination rate, and ion column density. Among these, only the
ionization rate can respond instantaneously to changes in radiation.
Consequently, the initial rate of change in the column density of \( N_i \) ion
is given by \( -N_i I_i + N_{i-1} I_{i-1} \). However, this quantity is
typically nonzero at the peak of \( N_i \), leading to a misalignment between
the boundaries of positive and negative responses. Such hybrid effects
introduce additional complexity in the interpretation of gas properties,
highlighting the need for further investigation.

*C. -A. Hsieh,T. Goto,C. -T. Ling,S. J. Kim,T. Hashimoto,T. C. -C. Chien,A. Y. -A. Chen*

**TL;DR**: 本研究利用JWST CEERS巡天的中红外SED拟合方法，研究了遮蔽活动星系核的黑洞吸积历史，发现黑洞吸积密度在红移1到3之间达到峰值，并探讨了中红外观测在探测遮蔽AGN方面的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域关注黑洞吸积历史及其与星系共同演化的关系，但现有研究在探测低光度遮蔽AGN方面存在局限性，JWST的早期观测为填补这一空白提供了机会。

Data: 使用了JWST CEERS巡天的中红外SED拟合数据。

Method: 采用中红外SED拟合方法计算黑洞吸积率，并构建中红外光度函数以估计黑洞吸积密度。

Result: 研究发现黑洞吸积密度在红移1到3之间达到峰值，中红外观测比X射线观测更有效地探测遮蔽AGN，但结果仍需更大样本验证。

Abstract: This study presents the black hole accretion history (BHAH) of obscured
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) identified from the JWST CEERS survey by Chien et
al. (2024) using mid-infrared (MIR) SED fitting. We compute black hole
accretion rates (BHARs) to estimate the black hole accretion density (BHAD),
$\rho_{L_{\mathrm{disk}}}$, across $0 < z < 4.25$. MIR luminosity functions
(LFs) are also constructed for these sources, modeled with modified Schechter
and double power law forms, and corresponding BHAD, $\rho_{\mathrm{LF}}$, is
derived by integrating the LFs and multiplying by the luminosity. Both
$\rho_{\mathrm{LF}}$ extend to luminosities as low as $10^7 \, L_{\odot}$, two
orders of magnitude fainter than pre-JWST studies. Our results show that BHAD
peaks between redshifts 1 and 3, with the peak varying by method and model, $z
\approx 1$--2 for $\rho_{L_{\mathrm{disk}}}$ and the double power law, and $z
\approx 2$--3 for the modified Schechter function. A scenario where AGN
activity peaks before cosmic star formation would challenge existing black hole
formation theories, but our present study, based on early JWST observations,
provides an initial exploration of this possibility. At $z \sim 3$,
$\rho_{\mathrm{LF}}$ appears higher than X-ray estimates, suggesting that MIR
observations are more effective in detecting obscured AGNs missed by X-ray
observations. However, given the overlapping error bars, this difference
remains within the uncertainties and requires confirmation with larger samples.
These findings highlight the potential of JWST surveys to enhance the
understanding of co-evolution between galaxies and AGNs.

### [11] [Correcting for the effects of the point spread function in intra-halo light measurements and application to deep Hyper Suprime-Cam data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24395)
*L. P. Garate-Nuñez,A. S. G. Robotham,S. Bellstedt,L. J. M. Davies*

**TL;DR**: 本文提出了两种独立技术结合的方法，用于在星系群和星系团中统计稳健地估计内晕光（IHL）成分，并通过模拟和实际观测验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 内晕光（IHL）是围绕星系、星系群和星系团的弥散恒星成分，其形成与系统的层次结构组装密切相关，是星系演化的关键示踪物。然而，IHL的低表面亮度（LSB）使其难以检测，也难以与望远镜的点扩散函数（PSF）效应区分。

Data: 使用了5440个Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Public Data Release 3（HSC-SSP PDR3）模拟观测数据，以及GAMA星系群G400138的HSC-PDR3 UD数据（g、r和i波段）。

Method: 提出了两种技术：第一种校正PSF散射效应以获得无偏的LSB测量；第二种使用马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）优化算法对IHL成分拟合指数模型。

Result: 结果表明，PSF校正对准确估计IHL至关重要，未校正时IHL模型会高估真实通量达100倍，有效半径达10倍。实际观测中，GAMA群G400138的IHL分数在g、r和i波段分别为0.19、0.08和0.06。

Abstract: The intra-halo light (IHL) is the diffuse stellar component that surrounds
galaxies, groups, and clusters. Its formation is intimately linked to the
hierarchical assembly of the system, making it a key tracer of galaxy
evolution. However, the low surface brightness (LSB) of the IHL makes it
challenging to detect and also to distinguish from the point spread function
(PSF) effect of the telescope. In this paper, we present two independent
techniques that, when combined, provide a statistically robust estimation of
the IHL component in galaxy groups and clusters. The first technique corrects
for the PSF-scattering effect to obtain unbiased LSB measurements, while the
second fits an exponential model to the IHL component using a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) optimiser algorithm. To test our methodology, we build a set
of 5440 Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Public Data Release 3
(HSC-SSP PDR3) mock observations of Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) groups,
each containing an IHL component with a flux fraction ($\mathrm{f_{IHL}}$)
ranging from 0.01 to 0.5. Our results demonstrate the importance of properly
removing the PSF-scattered flux, especially at lower $\mathrm{f_{IHL}}$.
Without the PSF correction, our IHL model overestimates the true flux by up to
a factor of 100, and the effective radius by up to a factor of 10. Finally, we
apply our methodology to real observations and estimate the $\mathrm{f_{IHL}}$
of the GAMA group G400138 using HSC-PDR3 UD data in the $\textit{g,r}$ and
$\textit{i}$-bands, finding median IHL fractions of: $\mathrm{f_{g,IHL}}$
$\sim$ 0.19$^{+0.09}_{-0.01}$, $\mathrm{f_{r,IHL}}$ $\sim$
0.08$^{+0.06}_{-0.02}$ and $\mathrm{f_{i,IHL}}$ $\sim$ 0.06$^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$.

### [12] [Chemical tagging of tidal tail star candidates of NGC 6362](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24522)
*Andrés E. Piatti*

**TL;DR**: 本文通过光谱分析发现，NGC~6362球状星团的潮汐尾候选恒星在金属丰度和元素组成上与星团本身不符，主要属于银河系厚盘或薄盘，而非星团潮汐尾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: NGC~6362球状星团被认为存在由恒星组成的潮汐尾，这些恒星在自行运动和颜色-星等图上与星团恒星相似，且分布在受星际吸收影响较小的区域。

Data: 使用了欧洲南方天文台VLT@FLAMES的光谱数据。

Method: 对潮汐尾候选恒星进行了详细的化学元素丰度光谱分析，包括Mg、Ca、Sc、Ti、Cr、Ni和Ba等元素。

Result: 研究发现，这些候选恒星的金属丰度和元素组成与NGC~6362星团不符，主要属于银河系厚盘或薄盘，且径向速度分布与星团恒星不同，表明基于运动学特性选择潮汐尾恒星的方法可能不如之前认为的可靠。

Abstract: The inner Milky Way disk globular cluster NGC~6362 appears to exhibit tidal
tails composed of stars that have proper motions and positions in the
color-magnitude diagram similar to those of cluster stars. Because recent
results seem also to show that these stars are distributed across the regions
least affected by interstellar absorption and reproduce the observed composite
star field density map, we carried out a detailed spectroscopic analysis of a
number of chemical element abundances of tidal tail star candidates in order to
investigate the relationship of them with NGC~6362. From European Southern
Observatory's VLT@FLAMES spectra we found that the red giant branch stars
selected as cluster's tidal tail stars do not have overall metallicities nor
abundances of Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Ni and Ba similar to the cluster's ones.
Moreover, they are mainly alike to stars that belong to the Milky Way thick
disk, some of them could be part of the thin disk and a minor percentage could
belong to the Milky Way halo star population. On the other hand, since the
resulting radial velocities do not exhibit a distribution function similar to
that of cluster's stars, we concluded that looking for kinematic properties
similar to those of the cluster would not seem to be an approach for selecting
cluster's tidal tail stars as suitable as previously thought.

*O. Feher,S. E. Ragan,F. D. Priestley,P. C. Clark*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过观测巨分子丝中的HCN、HCO+和N2H+发射，发现N2H+最能追踪高密度气体，且其发射在不同环境中较为均匀，而其他分子发射和比例的变化主要由中等密度气体驱动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 巨分子丝是研究银河系中恒星形成物质及其在空间尺度上积累的理想场所，这些尺度与外部星系的研究尺度相当。目前对高密度气体追踪的研究存在不足，尤其是在不同环境（如臂间和臂内）中的比较。

Data: 使用了HCN(1-0)、HCO+(1-0)、N2H+(1-0)的发射数据，以及COHRS 12CO(3-2)、CHIMPS 13CO(3-2)和Herschel的柱密度图。

Method: 通过比较不同分子发射的特性，评估高密度气体追踪的效果，并分析其在臂间和臂内环境中的差异。

Result: 研究发现N2H+最能追踪高密度气体，且其发射在不同环境中较为均匀；其他分子发射和比例的变化主要由中等密度气体驱动，而非恒星形成气体。此外，同一丝状结构内不同区域的分子发射和比例差异可能大于臂间和臂内的差异。

Abstract: Giant Molecular Filaments are opportune locations in our Galaxy to study the
star-forming interstellar matter and its accumulation on spatial scales
comparable to those now becoming available for external galaxies. We mapped the
emission of HCN(1$-$0), HCO$^+$(1$-$0), and N$_2$H$^+$(1$-$0) towards two of
these filaments, one associated with the Sagittarius arm and one with an
interarm area. Using the data alongside the COHRS $^{12}$CO(3$-$2), the CHIMPS
$^{13}$CO(3$-$2), and $\textit{Herschel}$-based column density maps, we
evaluate the dense gas tracer emission characteristics and find that although
its filling factor is the smallest among the studied species, N$_2$H$^+$ is the
best at tracing the truly dense gas. Significant differences can be seen
between the $^{13}$CO, HCN, and $N$(H$_2$)$_{\mathrm{dust}}$ levels of the arm
and interarm, while the N$_2$H$^+$ emission is more uniform regardless of
location, meaning that the observed variations in line ratios like
N$_2$H$^+$/HCN or N$_2$H$^+$/$^{13}$CO are driven by species tracing
moderate-density gas and not the star-forming gas. In many cases, greater
variation in molecular emission and ratios exist between regions inside a
filament than between the arm and interarm environments. The choice of measure
of the dense gas and the available spatial resolution have deep impact on the
multi-scale view of different environments inside a galaxy regarding molecular
emissions, ratios, and thus the estimated star formation activity.

Data: 研究使用了SMUDGes调查中的7,070个候选超弥散星系（UDGs）的数据。

Method: 通过视觉形态学方法对候选星系进行分类，并分析了其形态特征。

Result: 研究发现了一系列有趣的星系类型，包括8个正在合并的星系、7个合并后的星系、29个矮环星系以及68个受潮汐影响的星系，最终确认了6,553个未受干扰的UDG候选者。

Abstract: We re-examine the 7,070 candidate ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in the
SMUDGes survey and provide classifications based on their visual morphology.
Among the more interesting cases, we identify objects along a low surface
brightness galaxy merger sequence (ongoing mergers (8) and post-mergers (7))
and a distinct set of dwarf ring galaxies (29). The ring galaxies are
hypothesized to be the result of nearly polar-axis collisions, but the
responsible companions are undetected. We also highlight objects in the catalog
that appear to be tidally affected (68), thereby cautioning that their
cataloged parameters may be unreliable. Finally, we identify contaminants of
various types in the catalog, leaving 6,553 as viable undisturbed UDG
candidates. We discuss all categories and provide example images of the more
interesting ones.

Background: 银河系中心的黑洞Sgr A*周围恒星的轨道进动效应可以用来测试“无毛定理”，但目前需要更靠近黑洞的恒星以增强自旋效应的影响。

Data: 本文使用了Sgr A*周围恒星轨道的天体测量和光谱数据。

Result: 研究展示了三种轨道时间尺度的进动率，并提供了2PN阶的进动率表达式，这些结果有助于通过GRAVITY+观测约束Sgr A*的自旋效应。

Abstract: Measuring the astrometric and spectroscopic data of stars orbiting the
central black hole in our galaxy (Sgr A*) offers a promising way to measure
relativistic effects. In principle, the "no-hair" theorem can be tested at the
Galactic Center by monitoring the orbital precession of S-stars due to the
angular momentum (spin) and quadrupole moment of Sgr A*. Closer-in stars, more
strongly affected by the black hole's rotation, may be required. GRAVITY+ could
detect such stars that are currently too faint for GRAVITY. We aim to
analytically and numerically characterize orbital reorientations induced by
spin-related effects of Sgr A* up to the second post-Newtonian (2PN) order. We
use the two-timescale method to derive the 2PN analytical expressions of the
secular evolution of the orbital parameters that are related to the observer.
To study the interaction between the orbital and spin orientations, we
introduce observer-independent quantities that offer insight into the Kerr
geometry. We also use the post-Newtonian code OOGRE to simulate hypothetical
stars orbiting closer to Sgr A*, where spin and quadrupole effects are
stronger. This enables comparison with our analytical predictions. We exhibit
three orbital-timescale precession rates that encode the in-plane pericenter
shift and the out-of-plane redirection of the osculating ellipse. We provide
the 2PN expressions of these precession rates and express the orbit-integrated
associated angular shifts of the pericenter and of the ellipse axes. We relate
these orbital-timescale precession rates to the secular-timescale precession of
the orbital angular momentum around the black hole spin axis. We consider that
the theoretical insight we provide in this article will be useful in
constraining the spin effect of Sgr A* with GRAVITY+ observations.

*Calum Hawcroft,Claus Leitherer,Oskar Arangure,John Chisholm,Sylvia Ekstrom,Sebastien Martinet,Lucimara Martins,Georges Meynet,Christophe Morisset,Andreas Sander,Aida Wofford*

**TL;DR**: The paper presents an update to the STARBURST99 population synthesis code, now ported to Python (pySTARBURST99), incorporating new evolutionary tracks and synthetic SEDs for stars up to 300-500Msol, and predicting enhanced ionising flux and other properties across a wider range of metallicity and mass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: STARBURST99 is a widely used population synthesis code for predicting the integrated properties of star-forming galaxies. The current study updates the code to include new evolutionary tracks and synthetic SEDs, addressing gaps in low metallicity environments and high-mass star models.

Data: The study uses evolutionary tracks and synthetic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for stars up to 300-500Msol, covering a range of metallicities and including both rotating and non-rotating models.

Method: The authors ported the STARBURST99 code to Python (pySTARBURST99) and incorporated new evolutionary tracks and synthetic SEDs. They analyzed the impact of these updates on properties like ionising flux, bolometric luminosity, and wind power.

Result: The updates led to a 0.3 dex increase in H I ionising flux in the first 2Myr when extending the upper mass limit to 300Msol. Lower metallicities showed higher H I fluxes at later times, and rotating models consistently outperformed non-rotating ones in H I production. Similar trends were observed for He I, He II, and other properties.

Abstract: STARBURST99 is a population synthesis code tailored to predict the integrated
properties or observational characteristics of star-forming galaxies. Here we
present an update to STARBURST99 where we port the code to python, include new
evolutionary tracks both rotating and non-rotating at a range of low
metallicity environments. We complement these tracks with a corresponding grid
of new synthetic SEDs. Additionally we include both evolutionary and spectral
models of stars up to 300-500Msol. Synthesis models made with the python
version of the code and new input stellar models are labelled pySTARBURST99. We
make new predictions for many properties, such as ionising flux, SED,
bolometric luminosity, wind power, hydrogen line equivalent widths and the UV
beta-slope. These properties are all assessed over wider coverage in
metallicity, mass and resolution than in previous versions of STARBURST99. A
notable finding from these updates is an increase in H I ionising flux of 0.3
dex in the first 2Myr when increasing the upper mass limit from 120 to 300Msol.
Changing metallicity has little impact on H I in the first 2Myr (range of 0.015
dex from Z = 0.02 to 0.0) but lower metallicities have higher H I by 1 dex
(comparing Z = 0.02 to 0.0004) at later times, with Z = 0.0 having even higher
H I at later times. Rotating models have significantly higher H I than their
equivalent non-rotating models at any time after 2Myr. Similar trends are found
for He I and He II, bolometric luminosity and wind momentum, with more complex
relations found for hydrogen line equivalent widths and UV beta-slopes.

**TL;DR**: The paper proposes a CNN-MLP model combining Convolutional Neural Networks and Multilayer Perceptrons to improve photometric redshift estimation for Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs), achieving high accuracy and benefiting cosmological surveys like DESI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) are vital for cosmological studies, especially in understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe and dark energy. However, accurately selecting ELGs for surveys like DESI is challenging due to uncertainties in photometric redshift determination.

Data: The study uses images and photometric data from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10.

Method: The proposed method is a novel CNN-MLP approach that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image data processing and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) for photometric feature integration.

Result: The CNN-MLP model achieves a σ_NMAD of 0.0140 and an outlier fraction of 2.57%, significantly improving ELG photometric redshift estimation accuracy. The approach also explores redshifts for different galaxy types and is expected to benefit future surveys like LSST, CSST, and Euclid.

Abstract: Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) are crucial for cosmological studies,
particularly in understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe and the
role of dark energy. ELGs form an essential component of the target catalogue
for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), a major astronomical
survey. However, the accurate selection of ELGs for such surveys is challenging
due to the inherent uncertainties in determining their redshifts with
photometric data. In order to improve the accuracy of photometric redshift
estimation for ELGs, we propose a novel approach CNN-MLP that combines
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). This
approach integrates both images and photometric data derived from the DESI
Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10. By leveraging the complementary
strengths of CNNs (for image data processing) and MLPs (for photometric feature
integration), the CNN-MLP model achieves a $\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}}$ (normalised
median absolute deviation) of 0.0140 and an outlier fraction of 2.57%. Compared
to other models, CNN-MLP demonstrates a significant improvement in the accuracy
of ELG photometric redshift estimation, which directly benefits the target
selection process for DESI. In addition, we explore the photometric redshifts
of different galaxy types (Starforming, Starburst, AGN, Broadline).
Furthermore, this approach will contribute to more reliable photometric
redshift estimation in ongoing and future large-scale sky surveys (e.g. LSST,
CSST, Euclid), enhancing the overall efficiency of cosmological research and
galaxy surveys.

Background: Berkeley 65（Be 65）是一个研究较少的星团，目前对其动力学特征和变星性质了解有限。

Method: 通过长期光学测光数据分析星团的半径、距离、年龄，并识别和分类变星。

Result: 确定了星团的半径（1.6角分）、距离（2.0±0.1 kpc）和年龄（约160 Myr），发现了64颗周期性变星和16颗非周期性变星，并对其进行了分类和光变曲线分析。

Abstract: We present a decade-long investigation of a poorly studied cluster, Berkeley
65 (Be 65), using deep optical data from the telescopes of ARIES, Nainital
Observatory. We estimate its radius ($R_{cluster}$ = 1.6$^{'}$, aspect ratio of
$\sim$1.1), distance (2.0 $\pm$ 0.1 kpc) and age ($\sim$160 Myrs). A clear
turn-off point at $\sim$1.7 M$_\odot$ in the mass function suggests the escape
of low-mass stars, and the lower photometric mass compared to the dynamical
mass indicates ongoing disruption due to external forces. Our long-baseline
optical photometric data also identifies 64 periodic and 16 non-periodic stars
in this region. We have presented the light curves and the classification of
those variables. The periodic stars have periods ranging from $\sim$0.05 days
to $\sim$3.00 days and amplitude ranges from $\sim$8 mmag to $\sim$700 mmag.
The nonperiodic stars show variation from $\sim$30 mmag to $\sim$500 mmag. The
periodic stars include main-sequence pulsating variables such as Slow Pulsating
B-type, $\delta$ Scuti, RR Lyrae, and $\gamma$ Doradus. We report a detached
binary system and rotating variables similar to BY Draconis-type stars
exhibiting variable brightness caused by starspots, chromospheric activity, and
magnetic field-related phenomena.

**TL;DR**: 研究利用哈勃太空望远镜的数据分析了仙女座星系（M31）和三角座星系（M33）中红超巨星（RSGs）的双星比例，发现其分别为33.4%和30.9%，并与BPASS双星演化模型的预测一致。


<details>

Background: 红超巨星（RSGs）的双星性质影响其演化和超新星的命运，但此前地面观测的样本数量和分辨率有限。

Data: 使用哈勃太空望远镜（HST）的测光数据，包括仙女座星系（M31）的PHAT巡天和三角座星系（M33）的PHATTER巡天数据，分别识别出2,612和3,294颗红超巨星。

Method: 通过F110W-F160W与F160W的色指数图筛选红超巨星样本，并拟合其光学和近红外波段的光谱能量分布（SED）以获取恒星参数；通过紫外（UV）超量检测双星候选体。

Result: M31和M33中红超巨星的双星比例分别为33.4%±0.9%和30.9%±0.8%，且高光度红超巨星的双星比例在M31中下降至31.6%±1.9%，在M33中上升至34.7%±1.8%，与BPASS模型预测一致。

Abstract: The binarity of red supergiants (RSGs) influences their evolution and the
fate of supernovae. We investigate the binary fraction of RSGs in the Andromeda
Galaxy (M31) and Triangulum Galaxy (M33) using photometry from the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST), which offers high spatial resolution to resolve more RSGs. A
preliminary step involves identifying a reliable and complete RSG sample using
the F110W $-$ F160W versus F160W diagram, yielding 2,612 RSGs from the
Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey of M31 3,294 RSGs from the
Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury: Triangulum Extended Region (PHATTER)
survey of M33. These samples suggest total RSG populations in M31 and M33 of
6,563 and 7,572, respectively. These estimates significantly exceed previous
ones from the ground-based observations, an increase attributed to the superior
spatial resolution of the HST. The stellar parameters of these RSGs, including
effective temperature ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}$), radius ($R$), and luminosity ($L$),
are derived by fitting their spectral energy distribution (SED) across optical
and near-infrared bands. Binary candidates are identified by detecting
ultraviolet (UV) excesses in their SEDs compared to the single-star RSG model
prediction. The binary fraction is determined to be 33.4% $\pm$ 0.9% for M31
and 30.9% $\pm$ 0.8% for M33. For more luminous RSGs with log $L/L_{\odot} >
4.0$, the binary fraction decreases to 31.6% $\pm$ 1.9% in M31 and increases to
34.7% $\pm$ 1.8% in M33, respectively. These results are in good agreement with
predictions from the BPASS binary evolution model.

Background: 褐矮星是介于恒星和行星之间的天体，研究其光谱能量分布有助于理解其大气成分和物理性质。目前对褐矮星的多波段观测数据仍不完整，尤其是中红外波段的特征研究较少。

Data: 使用了JWST NIRSpec G395H、Magellan FIRE echelle、MIRI中红外测光数据，以及Keck I、IRTF、Magellan、AKARI、Spitzer的光谱数据和多个巡天任务的测光数据。

Abstract: We present the a near complete spectral energy distribution (SED) for an
extrasolar world: the T8 brown dwarf 2MASS~J04151954$-$0935066. Spanning from
optical to mid-infrared (0.7--20.4 micron) wavelengths, the SED for this
substellar atmosphere is constructed from new JWST NIRSpec G395H ($R\sim$2700)
and Magellan FIRE echelle ($R\sim$8000) near-infrared spectra, along with MIRI
mid-infrared photometry complemented by spectra from Keck I, IRTF, Magellan,
AKARI, Spitzer and photometry from various surveys and missions. The NIRSpec
G395H spectrum reveals strong molecular absorptions from NH$_{3}$, CH$_{4}$,
H$_{2}$S, CO$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$O at approximately 3.00, 3.35, 3.95, 4.25, and
5.00 micron respectively, along with the presence of a CO absorption feature
detected mainly at $\sim$ 4.6 micron. We detect no absorption of near-infrared
K I doublets in the $R\sim8000$ FIRE spectra. In the mid-infrared IRS spectrum,
we tentatively identify a new CO$_{2}$ feature at 14--16 micron. The
comprehensive SED allows us to empirically constrain bolometric luminosity,
effective temperature, mass and radius. Additionally, we demonstrate that the
NIRSpec G395H resolution, the highest allowable by JWST, enables a precise
radial velocity measurement of $47.1\pm1.8$ km s$^{-1}$ for the object, in
agreement with previous measurements.

Abstract: We investigate the strong gravitational lensing properties of fuzzy dark
matter (FDM) halos, focusing on the magnification properties near radial
critical curves (CCs). Using simulated lenses we compute magnification maps for
a range of axion masses and halo configurations. We show that FDM produces
enhanced central magnification and secondary CCs that are not easily reproduced
by standard cold dark matter (CDM), even when including subhalos. The strength
and scale of these effects depend primarily on the de~Broglie wavelength,
governed by the axion and halo masses. We find that axion masses in the range
$m_\psi \sim 10^{-22}$--$10^{-21}\,\mathrm{eV}$ in galaxy-mass halos lead to
distinctive magnification distributions. Our results suggest that observations
of highly magnified, compact sources near radial arcs, such as quasars or
supernovae, could serve as a powerful test for the presence of FDM.

Result: 研究发现，所有模拟均达到磁滞盘（MAD）状态，其中黑洞达到磁饱和状态，质量流入率遵循统一的径向标度关系。此外，还发现了摇摆吸积盘（RAD）状态，其特征为混沌取向的流入和间歇性喷流。MAD和RAD状态在典型尺度分离下达到可比较的吸积率，并可能形成周期性循环，影响喷流活动周期。

Abstract: Accretion onto supermassive black holes (BHs) can launch relativistic jets
that inject energy and momentum into their surroundings. Understanding how such
feedback shapes large-scale accretion is key to bridging observations from
galactic scales (e.g., the Bondi radius, $r_{\rm B}$) down to event horizon
scales ($r_{\rm g}$), spanning 5-6 orders of magnitude. We tackle this
challenge by varying the spatial scale separation across 2-4 orders of
magnitude and performing some of the longest contiguous 3D general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations to date ($t \lesssim 4\times10^6 r_{\rm
g}/c$), of Bondi-like accretion of rotating, non-relativistic gas with weak
vertical magnetic fields onto a rapidly spinning BH, achieving inflow
equilibrium out to $r \gtrsim 10^3 r_{\rm g}$. We find that, regardless of
scale separation or ambient gas rotation, all simulations reach a magnetically
arrested disk (MAD) state where the BH becomes magnetically saturated. In this
state, the mass inflow rate follows a universal radial scaling: $\dot{M}_{\rm
in}(r) \sim r^s$ with $s = 0.66 \pm 0.03$. The MAD state self-regulates through
jets, outflows, and magnetic flux eruptions that can disrupt coherent angular
momentum inflow, giving rise to a rocking accretion disk (RAD) state. This RAD
state features chaotically oriented inflows, weak intermittent jets, and a
steeper inflow slope of $s = 0.87 \pm 0.05$. The MAD and RAD BH accretion rates
become comparable at typical scale separations, $r_{\rm B}/ r_{\rm g} \gtrsim
10^5$. Weaker RAD outflows allow large-scale inflows to resume, restoring the
MAD state and enabling a recurring MAD-RAD cycle. These cycles can last tens of
Bondi timescales, $t_{\rm B} \sim 0.2\,\text{Myr} \times (r_{\rm B}/10^{5}
r_{\rm g})^{3/2} \times (M_{\rm BH}/10^9M_\odot)$, potentially setting the duty
cycle of jetted AGN outbursts, such as in M87*.

Background: 当前研究领域关注黑洞在活动星系核气体盘中的轨道演化，尤其是低倾角轨道上黑洞与气体引力相互作用的倾角阻尼效应。现有研究对倾角阻尼的具体机制和效率尚不明确，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Data: 研究使用了三维绝热流体动力学模拟数据，分析了不同倾角黑洞在气体盘中的演化行为。

Method: 采用三维绝热流体动力学模拟方法，在剪切框架下研究了黑洞与气体引力相互作用导致的倾角阻尼效应。

Result: 研究发现，对于初始倾角小于3H0R0-1的黑洞，倾角阻尼呈指数衰减；而对于更高倾角的黑洞，阻尼效率随倾角增加而降低。研究还发现气体动力学摩擦高估了阻尼强度，尤其是在低倾角系统中。模拟结果显示，在气体耗散效率高的区域，倾角阻尼时间尺度极短（τd < 10PSMBH），表明大多数通过气体捕获形成的黑洞双星应具有与气体盘几乎无倾角的轨道。

Abstract: We investigate the evolution of black holes on orbits with small inclinations
($i < 2^\circ$) to the gaseous discs of active galactic nuclei. We perform 3D
adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations within a shearing frame, studying the
damping of inclination by black hole-gas gravitation. We find that for objects
with $i<3H_0R_0^{-1}$, where $H_0R_0^{-1}$ is the disc aspect ratio, the
inclination lost per midplane crossing is proportional to the inclination
preceding the crossing, resulting in a net exponential decay in inclination.
For objects with $i>3H_0R_0^{-1}$, damping efficiency decreases for higher
inclinations. We consider a variety of different AGN environments, finding that
damping is stronger for systems with a higher ambient Hill mass: the initial
gas mass within the BH sphere-of-influence. We provide a fitting formula for
the inclination changes as a function of Hill mass. We find reasonable
agreement between the damping driven by gas gravity in the simulations and the
damping driven by accretion under a Hill-limited Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton
prescription. We find that gas dynamical friction consistently overestimates
the strength of damping, especially for lower inclination systems, by at least
an order of magnitude. For regions in the AGN disc where coplanar binary black
hole formation by gas dissipation is efficient, we find that the simulated
damping timescales are especially short with $\tau_d < 10P_\mathrm{SMBH}$. We
conclude that as the timescales for inclination damping are shorter than the
expected interaction time between isolated black holes, the vast majority of
binaries formed from gas capture should form from components with negligible
inclination to the AGN disc.

Abstract: The multi-messenger science using different observational windows to the
Universe such as Gravitational Waves (GWs), Electromagnetic Waves (EMs), Cosmic
Rays (CRs), and Neutrinos offer an opportunity to study from the scale of a
neutron star to cosmological scales over a large cosmic time. At the smallest
scales, we can explore the structure of the neutron star and the different
energetics involved in the transition of a pre-merger neutron star to a
post-merger neutron star. This will open up a window to study the properties of
matter in extreme conditions and a guaranteed discovery space. On the other
hand, at the largest cosmological scales, multi-messenger observations allow us
to study the long-standing problems in physical cosmology related to the Hubble
constant, dark matter, and dark energy by mapping the expansion history of the
Universe using GW sources. Moreover, the multi-messenger studies of
astrophysical systems such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes of
different masses, all the way up to a high redshift Universe, will bring
insightful understanding into the physical processes associated with them that
are inaccessible otherwise. This white paper discusses the key cases in the
domain of multi-messenger astronomy and the role of observatories in India
which can explore uncharted territories and open discovery spaces in different
branches of physics ranging from nuclear physics to astrophysics.

Background: 已知小麦哲伦云（SMC）中存在大量Be/X射线双星（BeXRBs），但由于其高能波段的瞬态特性，许多系统未被探测到。

Result: 识别出六个新的候选BeXRB系统，这些系统在自动化分析流程中可能被遗漏。

Abstract: It has long been known that a large population of Be/X-ray Binaries (BeXRBs)
exists in the Milky Way's neighboring dwarf galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud
(SMC), due to a recent period of intense star formation. Since 2016, efforts
have been made to monitor this population and identify new BeXRBs through the
Swift SMC Survey (S-CUBED). S-CUBED's weekly observation cadence has identified
many new BeXRBs that exist within the SMC, but evidence suggests that more
systems exist that have thusfar escaped detection. A major challenge in
identifying new BeXRBs is their transient nature at high-energy wavelengths,
which prevents them from being detected via their X-ray emission
characteristics when not in outburst. In order to identify sources that may
have been missed due to a long period of quiescence, it becomes necessary to
devise methods of detection that rely on wavelengths at which BeXRBs are more
persistent emitters. In this work, we attempt to use archival analysis of
infrared, optical, and ultraviolet observations to identify new candidate
BeXRBs that have been overlooked within the S-CUBED source catalog. Using
X-ray/optical selection of source properties, unsupervised clustering,
SED-fitting to VizieR archival measurements, and ultraviolet light curve
analysis, we are able to identify six new candidate BeXRB systems that
otherwise would have been missed by automated analysis pipelines. Using these
results, we demonstrate the use of ultraviolet through near-infrared
observational data in identifying candidate BeXRBs when they cannot be
identified using their X-ray emission.

**TL;DR**: 通过数值模拟研究发现，宽轨道行星可能是行星系统在恒星仍处于诞生星团时发生动力学不稳定的自然产物。

Background: 目前观测到的气态巨行星在数百天文单位的偏心轨道上运行，但其形成机制尚不明确，尤其是太阳系中可能存在的第九行星（Planet Nine）的形成机制。

Data: 研究使用了数值模拟数据。

Method: 通过数值模拟研究了行星系统在恒星仍处于诞生星团时的动力学不稳定性，分析了行星散射和附近恒星飞掠对宽轨道行星形成的影响。

Result: 研究发现，宽轨道行星的形成概率在5-10%（仅发生行星散射或巨行星不稳定性时）到40%（两者同时发生时）之间，而在模拟的系外行星系统中捕获效率为1-5%，表明每颗恒星至少存在10的负3次方个宽轨道行星。

Abstract: Gas giant planets have been detected on eccentric orbits several hundreds of
astronomical units in size around other stars. It has been proposed that even
the Sun hosts a wide-orbit planet of 5-10 Earth masses, often called Planet
Nine, which influences the dynamics of distant Trans-Neptunian objects.
However, the formation mechanism of such planets remains uncertain. Here we use
numerical simulations to show that very wide-orbit planets are a natural
byproduct of dynamical instabilities that occur in planetary systems while
their host stars are still embedded in natal stellar clusters. A planet is
first brought to an eccentric orbit with an apoastron of several hundred au by
repeated gravitational scattering by other planets, then perturbations from
nearby stellar flybys stabilise the orbit by decoupling the planet from the
interaction with the inner system. In our Solar System, the two main events
likely conducive to planetary scattering were the growth of Uranus and Neptune,
and the giant planets instability. We estimate a 5-10% likelihood of creating a
very wide-orbit planet if either happened while the Sun was still in its birth
cluster, rising to 40% if both were. In our simulated exoplanetary systems, the
trapping efficiency is 1-5\%. Our results imply that planets on wide, eccentric
orbits occur at least $10^{-3}$ per star.

Result: 研究发现，STAK模型预测的非对称谱线发射特征与L1527的观测数据相符，表明激波在原恒星盘与包层连接中起重要作用。

Abstract: High-spatial-resolution observations of disks around young stars suggest
planetary systems begin forming early, during the protostellar phase (< 1 Myr)
when stars accrete most of their mass via infall from the surrounding cloud.
During this era shocks are expected to be ubiquitous around the gaseous
accretion disk due to supersonic infall that strikes the disk. We investigate
the role of shocks using a theoretical and modeling framework we call the shock
twist-angle Keplerian (STAK) disk, connecting the disk and infalling envelope
gas via a shock using general physical principles. Briefly, at the shock,
energy is dissipated while angular momentum is conserved, so that the infalling
gas must change direction sharply, yielding a bend or twist in the streamlines.
The model's pre-shock gas follows free-fall parabolic trajectories, while the
post-shock gas is on lower-energy, elliptical orbits.
  We construct synthetic observations and find that the deviations from
circular Keplerian orbits are detectable in Doppler-shifted molecular spectral
lines using radio interferometers such as ALMA. Specifically, the STAK model
leads to line emission intensity and velocity-moment maps that are asymmetric
and offset with respect to the disk structure traced by the dust continuum. We
examine archival ALMA data for the class 0/I protostar L1527 and find the
C$^{18}$O velocity moment map has features resembling the disk plus envelope
emission that naturally arise when the two are connected by a shock. Thus,
spectral line observations having sub-km/s spectral resolution and angular
resolution sufficient to fully resolve the disk can reveal protostars'
envelope-disk shocks.
