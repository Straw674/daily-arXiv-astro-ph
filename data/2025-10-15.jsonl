The Multi-Order Coverage map (MOC) is a widely adopted standard\npromoted by the International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) to support\ndata sharing and interoperability within the Virtual Observatory (VO)\necosystem.

This study aims to explore\npotential enhancements to the MOC data structure by encapsulating textual\ndescriptions and semantic embeddings into sky regions. Specifically, we\nintroduce \"Textual MOCs\", in which textual content is encapsulated, and\n\"Semantic MOCs\" that transform textual content into semantic embeddings. These\nenhancements are designed to enable advanced operations such as similarity\nsearches and complex queries and to integrate with generative artificial\nintelligence (GenAI) tools. Method. We experimented with Textual MOCs by\nannotating detailed descriptions directly into the MOC sky regions, enriching\nthe maps with contextual information suitable for interactive learning tools.\nFor Semantic MOCs, we converted the textual content into semantic embeddings,\nnumerical representations capturing textual meanings in multidimensional\nspaces, and stored them in high-dimensional vector databases optimized for\nefficient retrieval.

We aim to evaluate the impact of self-gravitating effects on the\nevolution of vertical phase spirals and to quantify the bias introduced in\nestimating their excitation time when such effects are ignored. We analysed a\nhigh-resolution, self-consistent $N$-body simulation of the MW-Sagittarius\ndwarf galaxy (Sgr) system, alongside four test particle simulations in\npotentials contracted from the $N$-body snapshots. In each case, we estimated\nthe winding time of phase spirals by measuring the slope of the density\ncontrast in the vertical angle-frequency space. In test particle models, the\nphase spiral begins winding immediately after Sgr's pericentre passage, and the\nwinding time closely tracks the true elapsed time since the Sgr's pericentre\npassage. Adding the DM wake yields only a modest (< 100 Myr) reduction of the\nwinding time relative to Sgr alone. By contrast, the self-consistent $N$-body\nsimulation exhibits an initial, coherent vertical oscillation lasting $\\gtrsim$\n300 Myr before a clear spiral forms, leading to systematic underestimation of\nexcitation times. An analytical shearing-box model with self-gravity, developed\nby Widrow (2023), qualitatively reproduces this delay, supporting its origin in\nthe disc's self-gravitating response. Assuming that self-gravity affects phase\nmixing in the MW to the same degree as the $N$-body model, the lag induced by\nself-gravity is estimated to be $\\sim$ 0.3 Gyr in the solar neighbourhood.\nAccounting for this delay revises the inferred age of the MW's observed phase\nspiral to $\\sim$0.6-1.2 Gyr, in better agreement with the Sgr's pericentre\npassage.

While\nthese fluctuations could lead to interesting observable signatures at small\nscales, they are strongly constrained on large scales by cosmic microwave\nbackground observations. When the mass of the scalar is much lighter than the\ninflationary Hubble scale, $m\\ll H_I$, the spectrum of these fluctuations is\nflat. Meanwhile, if $m\\gg H_I$, the fluctuations are suppressed. A blue-tilted\nisocurvature spectrum which exhibits enhanced structure on small scales but\navoids observational constraints on large scales therefore requires a\ncoincidence of scales $m\\sim H_I$ for a free massive scalar. In this Letter, we\nshow that if a scalar field possesses a nontrivial potential, its inflationary\ndynamics naturally cause this condition to be satisfied, and so a blue-tilted\nspectrum is generically expected for a large class of potentials. Specifically,\nif its potential $V$ exhibits a region which satisfies the slow-roll condition\n$V''<3H_I^2$, the scalar condensate will spend most of inflation close to the\nboundary of this region, so that its effective mass is typically close to\n$H_I$. The resulting blue tilt is inversely proportional to the number of\n$e$-folds of inflation prior to horizon crossing. If the scalar is long-lived,\nthis mechanism leads to an attractor prediction for its relic abundance, which\nis insensitive to initial conditions of the scalar. In particular, a scalar\nfield with quartic self-interactions can achieve the correct abundance to\nconstitute all of the dark matter for a wide range of masses.

Stacking their rest-frame UV spectra reveals a\nprominent NV1240A P-Cygni, consistent with very young (~6Myr) stellar\npopulations dominated by massive stars. They are thus powerful and efficient\nionizing starbursts with an average ionizing photon production efficiency of\nlog(Xi_ion/Hz erg-1)=25.54. For one of these, J0217-0208 at z=6.2 (MUV=-23.4),\nwe analyzed NIRCam and NIRSpec data. Its SED indicates a young (~5Myr), compact\n(reff~260pc) starburst with a stellar mass of 10^9Msun and high sSFR\n(~100Gyr^-1). This translates to high stellar mass and SFR surface densities,\nabout 100x higher than typical galaxies at similar redshifts. NIRSpec further\nreveals strong nebular emission, for which we derive a high electron density\n(~10^3 cm^-3), a metallicity 12+log(O/H)=8.20 (from the direct method), and a\nsuper-solar N/O ratio (log(N/O)=-0.30). Furthermore, J0217-0208 shows broad\ncomponents in several rest-optical lines, indicating powerful ionized outflows,\nwhich appear heavily obscured (E(B-V)~0.6), in contrast to the nearly dust-free\nstellar continuum (E(B-V)~0.01). Combined with ALMA detections of a massive,\nextended, and cold dust reservoir, these findings point to dusty,\nfeedback-driven outflows carrying and pushing dust well beyond the stellar\ncore, boosting the observed UV luminosity. Our results suggest that UV-bright\ngalaxies at high redshift represent short-lived but extreme phases of rapid\nstellar mass growth, efficient ionizing photon production, and strong feedback.\nThe extreme properties of J0217-0208, such as supersolar N/O, steep UV slope,\ncompact size, and very high surface densities, closely mirror those of the\nbrightest galaxies at z>10, suggesting a shared evolutionary pathway.[Abridged]"}

In this study, we explore the\nastrophysical uncertainty associated with incorrectly classifying a pair of\nunlensed GW events as a lensed event, and the associated False Alarm Rate (FAR)\ndepending on the GW source properties. To understand the effect of unlensed\nastrophysical GW sources in producing false lensing detections, we have\nperformed a model-independent test using the pipeline GLANCE on a simulated\npopulation of merging binary-black holes (BBHs). We find that $\\sim$ 0.01\\% of\nthe event pairs can be falsely classified as lensed with a lensing threshold\nsignal-to-noise ratio of 1.5, appearing at a time delay between the event pairs\nof $\\sim$ 1000 days or more. We show the FAR distribution for the parameter\nspace of GW source masses, delay time, and lensing magnification parameter over\nwhich the model-independent technique GLANCE can confidently detect lensed GW\npair with the current LIGO detector sensitivity. In the future, this technique\nwill be useful for understanding the FAR of the upcoming next-generation GW\ndetectors, which can observe many more GW sources."}

Observational evidence suggests that this enrichment\noccurs during the period from when the disk forms to when it progresses into a\nprotoplanetary system, and is homogenous throughout the resultant planetary\nsystem. Whilst SLRs such as 26Al and 60Fe can be injected into disks through\ninteraction with Wolf-Rayet winds and supernovae, these outflows can disrupt\ndisks, and in the case of low-mass star-forming regions high-mass stars may not\nform at all. Recent research has determined the existence of AGB\n``interlopers'', Asymptotic Giant Branch stars that pass close to or through\nstar-forming regions that could be an alternative source of SLR enrichment to\nWR winds and supernovae. In this paper we study the effect of AGB interlopers\non star-forming regions from a dynamical perspective, determining the\nenrichment amount of 26Al and 60Fe in disks within small clusters via numerous\nN-body simulations via a parameter space exploration. We find that enrichment\nis widespread from AGB stars, with efficient enrichment dependent on the time\nat which the interloper intersects the star-forming region. Velocity is a\nfactor, though interlopers travelling at 30 km/s are capable of enriching many\ndisks in a star-forming region assuming they encounter a disk when the\ninterloper is more evolved."}

From a catalog of\n81 protostars, 527 disk objects, and 37,687 other sources including diskless\npre-main sequence and evolved contaminants, we identified significant\nvariability in the 3.4 um (W1) and 4.6 um (W2) bands. Because of W51's distance\n(~5.4 kpc) and extinction, the sample mainly includes intermediate- to\nhigh-mass YSOs (>2 Msun), unlike nearby regions dominated by low-mass stars.\nThis mass bias may affect the observed variability. In W2, 11.1% of protostars,\n7.6% of disk objects, and 0.6% of PMS+E sources showed secular variability,\nwhile 8.6%, 2.3%, and 0.5% showed stochastic variability; similar fractions\nwere found in W1. The variability fraction and amplitude increase toward\nearlier stages. Protostars exhibit high-amplitude stochastic changes likely\ndriven by dynamic accretion and extinction, whereas disk objects show more\nsecular patterns-linear, curved, or periodic-possibly due to moderate accretion\nvariations or disk geometry. Color-magnitude analysis shows that protostars\ngenerally redden as they brighten, consistent with enhanced dust emission or\nvariable extinction, while disk objects show mixed trends: roughly balanced in\nW1 but more often bluer in W2, suggesting reduced extinction or hotspot\nmodulation. These results highlight distinct mechanisms of variability across\nevolutionary stages and demonstrate that mid-infrared monitoring offers key\ninsight into accretion and disk evolution in young stars."}
