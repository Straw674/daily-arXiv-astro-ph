We investigate the binding energies of atoms to interstellar dust\nparticles, which play a key role in their growth and evolution, as well as for\nthe chemical reactions on their surfaces. Aims. We aim to compute the binding\nenergies of abundant atoms in the interstellar medium (C, N, O, Mg, Al, Si, S,\nCa, Fe, and Ni) to silicate dust. Methods. We used the Geometries, Frequencies,\nand Non-covalent Interactions Tight Binding (GFN1-xTB) method to compute the\nbinding energies. An FeMgSiO$_4$ periodic surface model, containing 81 local\nminima on the surface, was used. Results. A range of binding energies was found\nfor each element. The median of the binding energies follows the order Si (14.8\neV) > Al (12.8 eV) > Ca (12.7 eV) > C (9.5 eV) > O (8.1 eV) > N (6.2 eV) > Fe\n(6.0 eV) > S (5.2 eV) > Mg (2.4 eV). The probability distribution of binding\nenergies for each element except Ca is statistically consistent with a\nlog-normal distribution. Conclusions. In general, Si, Ca, and Al atoms have\nlarge binding energies. Thus, these atoms can stay on the silicate dust\nparticles at high temperatures. The binding energies of the other atoms, C, N,\nO, Mg, S, Fe and Ni, are relatively weak. However, the computed binding\nenergies for these elements are still far stronger than the energies associated\nwith dust temperatures typical of the ambient interstellar medium (ISM),\nsuggesting that silicate grains are generally stable against sublimation. We\nestimate sublimation temperatures for silicate grains to range from 1600 K to\n3000K depending on assumed grain size and lifetime. These binding energies on\nsilicate dust grains, estimated from first principles for the first time,\nprovide invaluable input to models of dust evolution and dust-catalyzed\nchemical reactions in the interstellar medium."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Reconstructing the star formation history (SFH) of disk galaxies is central\nto understanding their growth and evolution, yet such estimates can be strongly\nbiased by stellar radial migration - the redistribution of angular momenta over\ncosmic time. Using 186 Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) analogues from the\nTNG50 cosmological simulation, we compare star formation rates (SFRs) inferred\nfrom present-day stellar positions with those based on stellar birth radii to\nquantify the magnitude, spatial structure, and temporal evolution of\nmigration-induced biases. We find that radial migration systematically produces\nartificial star formation in regions that had not yet formed stars. Notably,\nabout 80% of galaxies exhibit outer-disk stars older than 10 Gyr, implying that\nthese populations must have migrated from the inner disk. Similar effects\nappear in about 45% of galaxies at intermediate radii during early epochs, and\nin 30% of quenched inner disks within the past 4 Gyr. Migration also smooths\nSFHs, washing out localized bursts and periods of suppressed star formation by\ndispersing stars across neighboring radii. The strength and imprint of these\ndistortions depend sensitively on galactic structure and evolutionary history:\nstrong bars drive mean SFR overestimates of up to 75% in the inner disk and\n150% in the outskirts; thinner, dynamically cold disks suffer average\nouter-disk biases up to 160%; while thick disks exhibit typical inner-disk\nbiases up to 125%. Merger timing further modulates these patterns. Our results\ndemonstrate that failing to account for stellar migration can lead to severe\nmisinterpretations of when and where stars formed, with direct implications for\nthe chemical and evolutionary histories of the MW and external galaxies."}

Emission from stars is included according to age-dependent\nspectra, and a redshift-dependent UV background. The inclusion of RT results in\nthe formation of eight additional faint dwarf galaxies with stellar masses of\n$10^{4}$ M$_{\\odot}$ to several $10^{5}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and only old stellar\npopulations, similar to the observed Ultra-Faint Dwarf galaxies.

For the more massive dwarf galaxies,\nradiative feedback suppresses star formation, making it less bursty and\nreducing explosive outflows. This consequently reduces the dark matter core\nsizes by a factor of 2-3, rendering the core sizes ($\\sim$ 1 kpc) more\nconsistent with observations. The distribution of HI in the circumgalactic\nmedium (CGM) is ubiquitous with a covering fraction of unity within $R_{vir}$,\nin good agreement with observations. It is rather insensitive to radiative or\nSN feedback at $z=0$, but at $z>5$ it is much higher in the RT simulation. In\ncontrast, the distribution of low ions like SiII is very compact and declines\nsharply beyond the ISM scale. CIV and OVI have a more extended distribution,\nbut their column densities are generally below the detection limit. Radiative\nfeedback leads to smaller column densities of the metal ions, partly due to the\nreduction of total metal production, and partly because hard photons from the\nstellar radiation escape the ISM and further ionise the CGM. The abundance of\nCIV is particularly sensitive to the latter effect."}

Under the assumption that dark\nmatter particles are neutralino-like particles annihilating at a rate close to\nthe maximum allowed by Fermi-LAT upper limits in dwarf galaxies, we obtain some\nconstraints on the intensity of the reacceleration and on the value of the\nneutralino mass. In particular, models with mass of the order of 10 GeV are\ngenerally disfavored, because they produce a high-frequency radio spectrum that\ncan not reproduce the possible flattening observed between 5 and 6.6 GHz; on\nthe other hand, models with mass of the order of 500 GeV, in order to reproduce\nthe observed spectrum at frequencies below 100 MHz, require a reacceleration\nphase longer than $10^9$ yr, which would require more than one event\nresponsible of the generation of turbulence in the cluster.

In this work, we present a novel observational test that,\nfor the first time, places constraints on the influence of DM inside NSs using\nreal GW data. By reanalyzing signals from events such as GW230529, GW200115,\nand GW200105, we derive new upper bounds on the DM fraction, $F_{\\chi}$, and\nparticle mass, $m_{\\chi}$, under the assumption that DM is described by a\nscalar field with a self-interaction potential.

Such an\nastrophysical origin would result in emission from a population of small,\ncurrently unresolved point-like sources - in contrast to the expected smoother\nemission resulting from dark matter annihilation. Given that the scale of\ngravitational microlensing, that is, the Einstein radius for stellar mass\nlenses, and hence, the degree of induced magnification, is sensitive to the\nsize of the emitting region, such microlensing will induce time variability in\nthe emission of astrophysical sources, whereas $\\gamma$-ray emission from dark\nmatter annihilation will effectively be immune to such influences.

The luminosity distribution is\nbimodal, and the CDGs separate into three chemically and evolutionarily\ndistinct groups, characterized by clear trends in sodium and CNO abundances,\n$\\alpha$-element enhancement, and kinematics. We find that two of these groups\nare only distinguished by their initial $\\alpha$-element abundances, thus\neffectively reducing the number of groups to two. Lithium enrichment is common\nacross all groups, linking CDGs to lithium-rich giants and suggesting a shared\nevolutionary origin.

We demonstrate how gravitational microlensing by stellar mass\nobjects along the line of sight to the Galactic Bulge can distinguish between\nthe possibility of extensive emission due to dark matter self-annihilation from\nmore prosaic astrophysical sources, namely millisecond pulsars. Such an\nastrophysical origin would result in emission from a population of small,\ncurrently unresolved point-like sources - in contrast to the expected smoother\nemission resulting from dark matter annihilation. Given that the scale of\ngravitational microlensing, that is, the Einstein radius for stellar mass\nlenses, and hence, the degree of induced magnification, is sensitive to the\nsize of the emitting region, such microlensing will induce time variability in\nthe emission of astrophysical sources, whereas $\\gamma$-ray emission from dark\nmatter annihilation will effectively be immune to such influences. However, we\nfind that detecting microlensing-induced variability requires significantly\ngreater sensitivity than that of current or planned $\\gamma$-ray detectors. For\na small population of bright GCE sources, more than an order-of-magnitude\nincrease in effective area over Fermi-LAT would be required, with events\nremaining extremely rare. For a large population of faint sources, events would\noccur multiple times a year, but would only be detectable with a\nfour-order-of-magnitude improvement.

We made a census of stars\nand disks using Gaia DR3 and infrared data. Interstellar absorption in the\ndirection of each star was derived by comparing SpTy from the literature and\nGaia colors. Stellar multiplicity analysis accounts for both direct observation\nof visual companions (Gaia data and high-contrast imaging) and indirect\ndetection of the presence of companions (eclipsing and spectroscopic binaries,\nand astrometry). The properties of the disks were obtained from the slopes of\nthe spectral energy distributions. As found in previous studies, the CrA\ncomplex can be divided into two regions: a younger region (CrA-Main: 3+/-1Myr)\nand an older one (CrA-North: 6.7+/-0.3Myr), slightly younger than previously\nthought. While CrA-Main still appears bound to the gas, CrA-North is unbound\nand expanding. The stars that belong to CrA-North were in the most compact\nconfiguration 3.72Myr ago. At that time, CrA-Main and CrA-North were much\ncloser to each other than they appear now. The fraction of disk-bearing stars\nis higher in Main than in North, as also expected due to the younger age of\nCrA-Main. We propose a formation history scenario for the CrA-complex. It\nstarted between 15 and 18 Myr ago with SNe explosions in the Upper\nCentaurus-Lupus complex, followed by a quiescent phase with little star\nformation. A star formation episode about 7Myr ago formed CrA-North stars.\nAbout 3.7Myr ago, a second SN explosion south of CrA-North triggered star\nformation in CrA-Main.
