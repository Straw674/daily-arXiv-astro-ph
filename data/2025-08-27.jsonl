To investigate its nature, we probabilistically classified\n4,471 radio sources at z < 0.947 using low-frequency radio data from the LoTSS\nDeep Fields alongside a multi-component model for nebular emission, sampled by\nspectra obtained with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). This was\ndone by combining three tools: (i) the identification of a radio excess, (ii)\nthe BPT diagram, and (iii) a modified Mass Excitation diagram, alongside Monte\nCarlo methods to estimate the probability that each source is either a\nstar-forming galaxy (SFG), a radio-quiet AGN (RQ AGN), or a\nhigh-\\low-excitation radio galaxy (HERG or LERG). This approach extends the\nprobabilistic classification framework of previous works by nearly doubling the\nredshift range, such that we can now probabilistically classify sources over\nthe latter half of cosmic history. Often regarded as the 'gold standard'\nmethod, spectroscopic classifications allow us to evaluate the performance of\nother methods. Using a 90 per cent reliability threshold, we find reasonable\noverall agreement (~77 per cent) with state-of-the-art photometric\nclassifications, but significant differences remain, including that we identify\n2-5 times more RQ AGN. Furthermore, our high-confidence spectroscopic\nclassifications show that radiatively-efficient and inefficient AGN exhibit\nclearly distinct Eddington-scaled accretion rate distributions, contrary to\nrecent findings in the literature. Overall, our results highlight the need for\nnew and forthcoming spectroscopic campaigns targeting radio sources, on the\npathway to the SKA."}

However, most reconstructions, both for the Milky Way and for\nexternal galaxies, implicitly assume that stars formed at their present-day\nradii. Using a range of zoom-in cosmological simulations, we show that stellar\nradial migration introduces strong and systematic biases in such SFH estimates.\nIn the inner disk (R < h_d), early star formation is typically underestimated\nby 25-50% and late star formation overestimated, giving the misleading\nimpression of prolonged, moderate activity. An exception occurs in the very\ncentral bin considered (~ 0.4h_d), which is consistently overestimated due to a\nnet inflow of inward migrators. At intermediate radii and in the outer disk,\nmigration drives the opposite trend: intermediate-age populations are\noverestimated by 100-200% as stars born in the inner disk migrate outward,\nwhereas genuinely in-situ populations are underestimated by ~ 50% as they\nthemselves continue to migrate. The net effect is that SFH peaks are suppressed\nand broadened, and the true rate of inside-out disk growth is systematically\nunderestimated. These distortions affect all galaxies in our sample and have\ndirect implications for interpreting spatially resolved SFHs from IFU surveys\nsuch as CALIFA and MaNGA, where present-day radii are often used as proxies for\nstellar birth sites. Correcting these biases will require accounting for disk\nmass, bar presence, disk kinematics and morphology, while recent birth-radius\nestimation techniques for Milky Way stars offer a promising path forward."}

IGM attenuation interferes\nwith high-redshift LyC observations, but growing samples of LyC observations at\nz<0.1 are revealing the properties of LyC-emitting galaxies. Along with\nmulti-wavelength observations of nearby LyC-emitting candidates, cosmological\nsimulations, and simulations of LyC escape from star-forming clouds, recent\nstudies are providing insights into the physics of LyC escape and the possible\ncharacteristics of the galaxies that reionized the universe. Here, I review\nprogress in LyC detections, the inferred indirect signatures of LyC escape and\ntheir application to high redshift, and our current understanding of the\nphysical conditions that lead to high LyC escape. These findings include:\nLyC-emitting populations are diverse, and multiple factors correlate with LyC\nescape, particularly neutral gas absorption, dust attenuation, nebular\nionization, and concentrated star formation. Radiative feedback plays a\ncritical role in the youngest starbursts with the highest LyC escape fractions,\nbut mechanical feedback may also contribute. Further research is needed to\nclarify the timing and role of different feedback mechanisms and to connect\nlocal LyC-production sites with the broader interstellar medium.

In the Standard Model of particle\nphysics, neutrino decay is highly suppressed, with a predicted lifetime on the\norder of $10^{43}$ years. However, non-standard models suggest the possibility\nof significantly shorter lifetimes, ranging from $10^{12}$ to $10^{17}$ years.\nObservations to date, however, only provide a lower limit of approximately\n$10^{12}$ years for the neutrino lifetime. In PRIMA's low-resolution mode ($R\n\\sim 100$), a diffuse background analysis, combined with the removal of point\nsources associated with known galaxies in a wide-field ($\\sim 1$ square degree)\nspectroscopic survey covering in the 24-240 $\\mu$m range could facilitate a\nsearch for neutrino decay lifetimes up to $O(10^{15})$ years.

By following the 100 most massive halos at $z = 0$ across cosmic\ntime, we find that only 40\\% of them were among the largest 100 halos at $z =\n1$. This suggests that many of today's most massive clusters were not the most\ndominant structures at earlier times, while some of the most massive objects at\nhigh redshift do not remain in the top mass ranks at later epochs. The\nhierarchical nature of structure formation predicts that, on average, massive\nhaloes grow over time, with their abundance in comoving space decreasing\nrapidly at higher redshifts. However, individual clusters exhibit diverse\nevolutionary paths: some undergo early rapid growth, while others experience\nsteady accretion or significant merger-driven mass changes. A key assumption in\nself-similar models of cluster evolution is that the most massive objects\nmaintain their rank in the mass hierarchy across cosmic time. In this work, we\ntest this assumption by constructing a mass-complete sample of haloes within\nthe $(1 h^{-1}{\\rm Gpc})^3$ volume of MultiDark and analysing when clusters\nenter and exit a high-mass-selected sample. Our results demonstrate that\ncluster selections must be carefully constructed, as significant numbers of\nobjects can enter and leave the sample over time.

We implemented\na neutral pressureless multifluid that samples the dust size distribution in\nthe RAMSES code. This multifluid is dynamically coupled to the gas via a drag\nsource term and self-gravity, relying on the Eulerian approach.

Grains over 100 microns significantly decouple from the gas. The\nspatial maps and the probability density functions indicate that dust\nenrichment within the first hydrostatic core and in some locations of the\nenvelope increases as a function of the grain size and the level of initial\nturbulence.

This region is particularly rich in molecular\nspectral signatures, whose measurements can help recover atmospheric parameters\nand provide a better understanding of giant planet formation and atmospheric\ndynamics. In the past years, exoplanet interferometry with the VLTI/GRAVITY\ninstrument has provided medium-resolution spectra of a dozen substellar\ncompanions in the near infrared. The 100-meter interferometric baselines allow\nfor the stellar and planetary signals to be efficiently disentangled at close\nangular separations (< 0.3''). We aim to extend this technique to the\nmid-infrared using MATISSE, the VLTI's mid-infrared spectro-interferometer. We\ntake advantage of the fringe tracking and off-axis pointing capabilities\nrecently brought by the GRA4MAT upgrade. Using this new mode, we observed the\ngiant planet $\\beta$ Pictoris b in L and M bands (2.75-5 $\\mu$m) at a spectral\nresolution of 500. We developed a method to correct chromatic dispersion and\nnon-common paths effects in the fringe phase and modelled the planet astrometry\nand stellar contamination. We obtained a high-signal-to-noise spectrum of\n$\\beta$ Pictoris b, showing the planet continuum in L (for the first time) and\nM bands, which contains broad absorption features of H$_2$O and CO. In\nconjunction with a new GRAVITY spectrum, we modelled it with the ForMoSA nested\nsampling tool and the Exo-REM grid of atmospheric models, and found a solar\ncarbon-to-oxygen ratio in the planet atmosphere. This study opens the way to\nthe characterization of fainter and closer-in planets with MATISSE, which could\ncomplement the JWST at angular separations too close for it to obtain exoplanet\nspectra. Starting in 2025, the new adaptive optics system brought by the\nGRAVITY+ upgrade will further extend the detection limits of MATISSE."}

To be submitted to ApJ. Comments welcome!", "summary": "Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a distinct class of stellar explosions,\nexhibiting peak luminosities 10-100 times brighter than those of normal SNe.\nTheir extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of\n$^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$ and its daughter $^{56}\\mathrm{Co}$ alone. Consequently,\nmodels invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed,\ncapable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For\nthese rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may\nalso contribute significantly to the spin-down, particularly during their early\nevolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within\nthe optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes\ntransparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve.\nIn this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the\ncombined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of\nSLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for\nmagnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence\nsuppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further\ninvestigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the\nlightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities.\nOur results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and\nradiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new\ninsights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines."}

In this work, we\ninvestigate whether measurements of the 21-cm power spectrum (PS) and\nbispectrum (BS) at large scales can be used to estimate the HIHM relation,\nwhich quantifies the HI distribution at small scales. As a proof of concept, we\nconsider the simulated 21-cm IM signal at $z=1$. We find that the measured\n21-cm PS and BS at large scales $(k \\le k_{ul} = 0.32 \\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-1})$ are\nwell modeled using perturbation theory, with only two free parameters namely\n$[\\Omega_{\\rm HI} b_1]$ and $\\gamma = b_2/b_1$. Combining the measured 21-cm PS\nand BS with an independent measurement of $\\Omega_{\\rm HI} $, we show that it\nis possible to estimate the three parameters that quantify the HIHM relation.\nWe expect observational estimates of the HIHM relation to shed light on galaxy\nformation and the evolution of the ISM. Our preliminary analysis ignores\nredshift space distortion and the system noise in IM observations, which we\nplan to address in future work."}

Specifically we consider\nseparately the string corrections $\\sim \\alpha'\\xi(\\phi)c_2\\,\\left(\n\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi \\partial^{\\mu}\\phi\\right)^2$ and $\\sim \\alpha'c \\square \\phi\n\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi \\partial^{\\mu}\\phi$, where $\\alpha'$ is the square of the\nstring scale. Our aim is to develop a theory which is self consistent in the\nsense that the field equations reproduce themselves in the slow-roll\napproximation. Such a requirement for the theory with $\\sim \\alpha'\\xi(\\phi)\nc_2\\left( \\partial_{\\mu}\\phi \\partial^{\\mu}\\phi\\right)^2$ resulted to a trivial\nnon-minimal coupling function $\\xi(\\phi)$, however a self-consistent framework\nemerged from the theory with correction term $\\sim \\alpha' c \\square \\phi\n\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi \\partial^{\\mu}\\phi$. The resulting theory can easily be\nworked out analytically and we obtained an inflationary theory that can easily\nbe fitted with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope constraints on the scalar\nspectral index and the updated Planck constraints on the tensor-to-scalar\nratio."}

Application to turbulent protostellar collapses", "categories": ["astro-ph.IM", "astro-ph.EP", "astro-ph.GA", "astro-ph.SR"], "comment": "Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "Stars and planets form in collapsing clouds of gas and dust. The presence of\ndust grains and their local distribution play a significant role throughout the\nprotostellar sequence, from the thermodynamics and the chemistry of molecular\nclouds to the opacity of collapsing protostellar cores and the coupling between\nthe gas and the magnetic field and down to planet formation in young and\nevolved disks. We aim to simulate the dynamics of the dust, considering the\nwhole range of grain sizes, from few nanometers to millimeters. We implemented\na neutral pressureless multifluid that samples the dust size distribution in\nthe RAMSES code. This multifluid is dynamically coupled to the gas via a drag\nsource term and self-gravity, relying on the Eulerian approach. We designed a\nRiemann solver for the gas and dust mixture that prevents unphysical\ndust-to-gas ratio variations for well-coupled grains. We illustrated the\ncapacities of the code by performing simulations of a protostellar collapse\ndown to the formation of a first hydrostatic core, both for small and large\ndust grains. Grains over 100 microns significantly decouple from the gas. The\nspatial maps and the probability density functions indicate that dust\nenrichment within the first hydrostatic core and in some locations of the\nenvelope increases as a function of the grain size and the level of initial\nturbulence. Thanks to the novel Riemann solver, we recovered the terminal\nvelocity regime, even at low resolution. Moreover, we successfully extended it\nto regimes where the grain inertia matters. The multifluid module performs the\ncoupling between the dust and the gas self-consistently all through the\ndynamical scales. The dust enrichment in the first hydrostatic core and the\nenvelope have been revised here, assuming the initial turbulence and grain\nsizes. This enables us to probe new potential conditions for planet formation."}
