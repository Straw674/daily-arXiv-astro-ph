Using red\ngiant stars from APOGEE DR17 and Gaia DR3, we model the age-dependent stellar\nkinematics with a quasi-isothermal distribution function and fit disc\nparameters as a function of age using non-parametric splines. We identify a\ntransition from thick to thin disc populations around 10 Gyr ago. Stars older\nthan this have short scale lengths ($\\sim$1.7 kpc), typical of the thick disc,\nwhile younger stars exhibit increasing scale length with decreasing age,\nconsistent with inside-out formation of the thin disc. This transition\ncoincides with the end of the starburst triggered by the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus\n(GSE) merger. Stars formed around 10 Gyr ago exhibit a dip in scale length,\neven shorter than that of the thick disc. Comparison with an Auriga simulation\nsuggests that this scale-length dip reflects gas disc shrinking caused by the\ntransition from a cold to hot gas accretion mode. We propose the following disc\nformation scenario: (1) the thick disc formed under cold-mode accretion; (2)\nthe GSE merger triggered a starburst and increased the total mass of the\nGalaxy, causing the transition to hot-mode accretion; (3) rapid gas consumption\nled to temporary shrinking of the star-forming gas disc; and then (4) thin disc\ngrows in an inside-out fashion, as the size of the star-forming gas disc grows\nvia hot-mode smooth gas accretion."}

Unlike traditional neural networks, which approximate\nindividual functions, NOs learn the mappings between function spaces. While NOs\nhave been predominantly tested on simplified 1D and 2D problems, such as those\nexplored in prior works, these studies fail to address the complexities of more\nrealistic, high-dimensional, and high-dynamic range systems. Moreover, many\nreal-world applications involve incomplete or noisy data, which has not been\nadequately explored in current NO literature. In this work, we present a novel\napplication of NOs to astrophysical data, which involves high-dynamic range\nprojections into an observational space. We train Fourier NO (FNO) models to\npredict the evolution of incomplete observational proxies with density\nvariations spanning four orders of magnitude. We demonstrate that FNOs can\npredict the effects of unobserved dynamical variables. Our work lays the\ngroundwork for future studies that forecast direct astronomical observables."}

Until now, most spectroscopically confirmed LRDs\nare found at z > 4 and it has been speculated that LRDs are tracing the early\nstages of black hole evolution. We report an independent rediscovery of a\nbroad-line active galactic nucleus (AGN), SDSS J102530.29+140207.3, at z = 0.1,\nwhich shows spectral features matching those of LRDs seen in the early\nUniverse, including the V-shaped spectrum, broad Balmer lines (with widths of\n1000-2000 km/s), and deep Balmer absorption. We present a new GTC observation\nof this LRD, which reveals an optical continuum similar to those of G-to-K\ngiant stars including an unambiguous G-band absorption originating from the CH\nmolecule. In addition, this local LRD shows a series of absorption lines\npotentially related to low-ionization ions or atoms but are deeper than what is\nobserved in empirical stellar templates. We further identify a series of [FeII]\nemission lines indicative of low-ionization gas, which we find also present in\nan JWST-selected LRD at z = 2.26. We find small but statistically significant\nvariability in H$\\alpha$ consistent with previous findings. Finally, with the\nnew X-ray observation from NuSTAR, we confirm the extreme X-ray weakness of\nthis LRD, which might imply Compton-thick gas obscuration with $N_{\\rm\nH}>10^{24}~{\\rm cm^{-2}}$.

We derive and classify power-law-in-time solutions to the governing\nequations in the adiabatic regime. In particular, a universal $t^{2/3}$ scaling\nemerges naturally when gravitational energy dominates or is comparable to\nthermal energy, irrespective of the ambient density profile, whereas the\nclassical Sedov-Taylor solution is recovered when gravity is negligible. Our\nanalysis reveals that, in regimes where SMBH gravity governs the shell\nexpansion, the SMBH mass can be inferred from radio observations of the shell.\nThis approach is independent of and complementary to conventional mass\nestimators, with direct implications for interpreting radio-emitting TDEs and\nprobing SMBH demographics. Our formalism further predicts that 10-100 GHz\nmonitoring with existing and planned facilities can yield SMBH masses within\nmonths of disruption, providing a time-domain analogue to reverberation\nmapping."}

The scenario we simulate\nassumes that a strong binary interaction enhanced the mass loss rate from the\nasymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar progenitor of NGC 1514, and shortly\nthereafter, the main-sequence companion accreted mass from the AGB star,\nlaunching a pair of jets. We find that adiabatic flows, where radiative losses\nare negligible, produce prominent rings, as observed in the infrared in NGC\n1514. In contrast, when radiative cooling is significant, the rings are thin\nand faint. Our results reinforce the prevailing notion that jets play a\nsubstantial role in shaping planetary nebulae (PNe). More generally, as the\nbinary companion to the central star of NGC 1514 avoided common envelope\nevolution, our results suggest that jets play a major role in many binary\nsystems experiencing stable mass transfer at high rates. This conclusion\ncomplements the view that jets play a significant role in unstable mass\ntransfer, specifically in common envelope evolution. Studies of strongly\ninteracting binary systems, whether stable or not, should include jets.
