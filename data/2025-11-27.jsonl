Specifically, we train a neural network to translate Nuker profile parameters into analytically deprojectable Multi Gaussian Expansion components, enabling physically realistic stellar mass models without requiring optical observations. We integrate this model into SuperMAGE, a differentiable dynamical modelling pipeline for Bayesian inference of supermassive black hole masses. Applied to ALMA data, our approach finds results consistent with state-of-the-art models while extending applicability to dust-obscured and active galaxies where optical data analysis is challenging."}

Three of the four CO emitters are multiple images of the same galaxy. Compared to previous line-emitter searches in ALMA deep fields, our sample probes molecular gas masses $\\sim$1 dex below the lower bound, thanks to gravitational lensing (typically $μ\\sim 4$, up to $\\sim$30 in extreme cases). Most emitters are located in a region similar to normal star-forming galaxies in the star formation rate (SFR) versus molecular gas mass plane. To reduce dependence on SFR and stellar mass, we analyzed the molecular gas fraction and depletion timescale as a function of distance from the star-formation main sequence. We found that most emitters broadly follow the scaling relations from previous studies, consistent within the intrinsic scatter. In addition, we serendipitously detected the CH $N = 1$, $J = 3/2 \\rightarrow 1/2$ $Λ$-doublet transition from one CO emitter at $z = 1.142$, representing the first detection of CH from an individual galaxy at cosmological distances through a blind survey. The CH/CO column density ratio of $\\sim$$10^{-4}$ is comparable to that of local AGN-host galaxies, suggesting that CH traces molecular gas associated with AGN activity, possibly irradiated by X-rays."}

Detection thresholds are established through peak SNR statistics and analysis of inverted maps. In this paper, we focus on the ALMA-accessible CANDELS fields (COSMOS, GOODS-S, and UDS), covering ~130,000 optical/NIR-selected galaxies spanning $0.0 < z < 15.0$. We identify 1288 detections (622 unique) with optical/NIR counterparts across the two methods, of which 832 detections (395 unique) appear in both. Among the 622 unique sources, 307 have spectroscopic redshifts from $0.12 < z < 6.85$. ECOGAL expands the parameter space previously explored by $A^3COSMOS$ and $A^3GOODS-S$ by incorporating the UDS field and integrating publicly available JWST datasets from the DAWN JWST Archive (DJA). We also highlight several science cases enabled by ECOGAL, including the evolution of cosmic gas and dust masses, obscured star formation and optically dark systems. ECOGAL provides science-ready data sets for the community and showcases the power of combining over a decade of accumulated public data with other legacy datasets. The data product is made publicly available and accompanies a post demonstrating the usage of the catalogue on the DJA webpage."}

We investigate the astrophysical origin of C using models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) appropriate for the Milky Way disk. We benchmark our results against APOGEE subgiant abundances. The trend between [C/Mg] and [Mg/H] is set by the total C yield as a function of metallicity. Observations indicate a gently rising [C/Mg] with [Mg/H], but AGB C production is predicted to decline with metallicity. Our sample therefore favours a scenario in which CCSN yields rise with metallicity to offset declining AGB C yields and drive a subtle increase in [C/Mg] with [Mg/H]. This result is consistent with massive star nucleosynthesis models incorporating rotation. The [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend is sensitive to delayed enrichment and therefore constrains the amount of AGB C production. Given the slope of this relation, we find that AGB stars likely account for 10-40 per cent of C at solar metallicity. Artificially shifting the AGB C yields towards lower mass stars with longer lifetimes also improves agreement with the observed [C/Mg]-[Mg/Fe] trend, possibly indicating a discrepancy with stellar evolution predictions or our assumed Fe production rate."}

We recast the dark sector, cosmic acceleration, large-scale structure, and cosmic tensions as emergent consequences of nonlocal memory and intrinsically persistent organization in a self-gravitating Universe. By introducing a maximum-caliber weight on cosmic histories and a bias functional encoding structural memory, we derive modified Friedmann, Boltzmann, and Poisson equations that naturally generate dark energy-like acceleration, dark matter-like clustering, and scale-dependent growth suppression. We also show how this approach can naturally help alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, can produce anisotropic velocity fields, and predict environment-dependent halo signatures that cannot arise from particle dark matter or scalar-field dark energy. We also derive a generalized horizon entropy and temperature, revealing a nonequilibrium statistical origin for cosmic acceleration and formulating a Law of Universal Arbitrage Equilibrium that governs the evolution of the Universe, showing that it is expanding towards a continuous form of Nash equilibrium. Cosmological Teleodynamics therefore offers a unified, emergent, and testable alternative to the conventional dark sector, rooted not in new particles but in the intrinsic statistical and systemic structure of cosmic memory, and shows that the universe itself operates like a giant potential game."}

A key morphological feature is the probabilistic assignment of stars to spiral arms based on age-dependent dynamical temperature, reproducing the observation that young tracers tightly confine to arms while older populations disperse. The software combines statistical generation with stellar physics by mapping synthetic populations to MESA or rapid SSE/BSE evolutionary tracks. Users can inspect specific evolutionary stages through automatic hierarchical classification, distinguishing evolutionary phases and spectral classes like Wolf-Rayet, O-type, or red supergiant stars across different metallicity environments.

It is known that dust is injected into the interstellar medium during early star formation by supernovae and later on by evolved stars. From individual objects, these mechanisms are well understood, but the overall dust production in star clusters at different evolutionary stages is still challenging to quantify. We present 22 massive (> 105M$_{\\odot}$) extra galactic star clusters with ages between 3 and 100 Myr exhibiting a compact dust morphology seen with JWST-MIRI. We only find PAH features associated with one star cluster and nineteen have already cleared themselves from their natal dust. Their main characteristic is a significant enhancement at 10$μ$m, which is likely due to silicate emission and cannot be explained by ionized gas. We discuss several possible explanations including dust production from evolved stars such as red super giants, more exotic star types like yellow hypergiants and luminous blue variable stars. Stochastic dust injection from supernovae or a single supernova in dense gas can also create significant silicate emission. However, for this scenario secondary tracers such as a X-ray signal are expected which we only observe in three star clusters. We find the most luminous 10$μ$m emitter to be the three most massive star clusters (> 106M$_{\\odot}$) which is at least a magnitude stronger than any known stellar sources indicating a rare mechanism that only appears at extreme masses and a short lifetime."}

Utilizing the dataset and Effective Field Theory (EFT)-based pipeline described in Paper 1, we constrain cosmological models with massive neutrinos ($Λ$CDM+$M_ν$), spatial curvature ($oΛ$CDM), dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a$CDM), and their combinations using the power spectrum and bispectrum of DESI galaxies and quasars. Our work also presents the first measurements of relevant non-minimal cosmological parameters from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and DESI full-shape (FS) data, which are made possible thanks to carefully chosen priors on EFT parameters. We find that the addition the FS likelihood to DESI's baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data improves the limits on the spatial curvature by a factor of two over the BAO only results, though the improvements are less significant with the CMB data. The dark energy equation of state figure-of-merit increases both with and without the supernovae data (SNe), by $\\approx30\\%$ and $\\approx20\\%$ relative to the CMB+BAO and CMB+BAO+SNe results, respectively. Our FS likelihood also yields the strongest CMB-independent constraint on the total neutrino mass $M_ν<0.32\\,{\\rm eV}$, with the $30\\%$ improvement due to the bispectrum. In combination with the CMB, we find a $14\\%$ improvement assuming the $Λ$CDM+$M_ν$ model (yielding $M_ν<0.059\\,{\\rm eV}$), but this increases to $22\\%$ when using non-minimal backgrounds: $M_ν<0.097\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $oΛ$CDM+$M_ν$ and $M_ν<0.13\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $w_0w_a$CDM+$M_ν$.

We use 17 simulated low-mass galaxies from the Auriga Project ($\\sim 3 \\times 10^8 \\, M_\\odot \\leq M_* \\lesssim 2 \\times 10^{10} \\, M_\\odot$). We study the metallicity and the ages of these galaxies and their stellar halos, as well as the relation between these two properties. We find that all galaxies have negative radial [Fe/H] gradients, and that the centres of less massive dwarfs are generally more metal poor than those of more massive dwarfs. We find no correlation between the metallicity gradients and intrinsic galaxy properties, such as stellar mass or accreted stellar mass, suggesting that these gradients are not a simple byproduct of galaxy evolution in the low-mass regime. We also find that the dispersion in the mass-metallicity relation found in the stellar halos of low-mass galaxies can be explained with the infall time of their most dominant satellite: at a fixed accreted stellar halo mass, dwarf galaxies that accreted this satellite at later times have more metal-rich accreted stellar halos. Regarding the ages of the analysed galaxies, we find a prominent U-shape in the radial mean age profiles of $\\sim 65\\%$ of them, which is mainly driven by the in situ stellar material. This presence of a U-shape in the age profiles is due to the combination of the cessation of recent star formation at large radial distances and the merger events these galaxies undergo, which redistribute the stellar material to their outer regions. When focusing on the ages of the stellar halos, we find that more massive ones are older than less massive ones. Our results show a wide variety in ages and metallicities of low-mass galaxies and their stellar halos, reflecting the complex and non-uniform evolutionary pathways these systems can follow."}

While previous work has focused on point-like lenses such as primordial black holes, we extend this framework to extended dark objects (EDOs), including ultracompact minihalos formed from the collapse of primordial overdensities. We develop an analytic model of microlensing by EDOs embedded in a macrolensing cluster potential and derive the resulting caustics and light curves. Depending on the EDO size relative to the effective Einstein radius, we show that they may generate additional narrow caustics, leading to novel features in the light curve. Applying our framework to the MACS J1149 LS1 ``Icarus'' event, we constrain EDOs with radii up to $10^7 R_\\odot$. Our results demonstrate that caustic-crossing events complement galactic microlensing searches, as they can probe EDOs with larger physical size.

Here we present the empirical relation between SFR and broadband optical-to-NIR colors learned from Spitzer MIPS and Herschel PACS/SPIRE imaging using an innovative stacking analysis that bins galaxies with similar optical-to-NIR spectral energy distributions using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). Stacking based on optical-to-NIR colors ensures that our FIR stacks are built from galaxies with similar intrinsic physical properties as opposed to stacking simply by stellar mass. We train a 40$\\times$40 SOM using 230,638 galaxies selected from the COSMOS field, and stack the mid-to-far infrared images from 24 micron to 500 micron. We are able to measure the median FIR luminosities from half of the SOM cells to calibrate the star formation rate. In addition to investigating the common structures of optical-to-NIR properties and FIR detections labeled on the SOM, we provide calibrated star formation rates for nearly half of the galaxies in the COSMOS fields down to $i-$band magnitude $\\leq 25.5$, and present the evolution of the galaxy main sequence for low-mass galaxies to redshift $z\\sim2.5$."}

We first survey the Euclid processing pipeline to identify all evident, potential sources of systematics, and classify them into two broad classes: angular systematics, which modulate the galaxy number density across the sky, and catastrophic redshift errors, which lead to interlopers in the galaxy sample. We then use simulated spectroscopic surveys to test our ability to mitigate angular systematics by constructing a random catalogue that represents the visibility mask of the survey; this is a dense set of intrinsically unclustered objects, subject to the same selection effects as the data catalogue. The construction of this random catalogue relies on a detection model, which gives the probability of reliably measuring the galaxy redshift as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of its emission lines. We demonstrate that, in the ideal case of a perfect knowledge of the visibility mask, the galaxy power spectrum in the presence of systematics is recovered, to within sub-percent accuracy, by convolving a theory power spectrum with a window function obtained from the random catalogue itself. In the case of only approximate knowledge of the visibility mask, we test the stability of power spectrum measurements and cosmological parameter posteriors by using perturbed versions of the random catalogue. We find that significant effects are limited to very large scales, and parameter estimation remains robust, with the most impacting effects being connected to the calibration of the detection model."}

Addressing this, we have developed a novel observing mode for WEAVE (William Herschel Telescope Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer) that enables efficient observations of low-surface-density target fields without incurring additional overheads from calibration exposures. As a pilot for the new mode, we introduce the WEAVE-TwiLight-Survey (WTLS), focusing on bright exoplanet-host stars and their immediate surroundings on the sky. High observational efficiency is achieved by superimposing multiple low-target-density fields and allocating the optical fibres in this configuration. We use a heuristic method to define fields relative to a central guide star, which serves as a reference for their superposition. Suitable guide fibres for each merged configuration are selected using a custom algorithm. Test observations have been carried out, demonstrating the feasibility of the new observing mode. We show that merged field configurations can be observed with WEAVE using the proposed method. The approach minimizes calibration times and opens twilight hours to WEAVE's operational schedule. WTLS is built upon the new observing mode and sourced from the ESA PLATO long-duration-phase fields. This survey will result in a homogeneous catalogue of approximately 6300 bright stars, including 62 known planet hosts, laying the groundwork for future elemental abundance studies tracing chemical patterns of planetary formation. This new observing mode (WEAVE-Tumble-Less) expands WEAVE's capabilities to rarely used on-sky time and low-density field configurations without sacrificing efficiency."}

Ignoring internal dynamics of particles in the dark matter halo and Keplerian rotations of stars in the galaxy, we focus on possible relative oscillations of the visible matter in the dark matter halo. This two-fluid model is somewhat similar to the ``giant dipole resonances'' in nuclei. We estimate possible amplitude and frequency of such oscillations assuming that the offset of the centers of mass is small as compared with the size of the galaxy. Such oscillations, if exist, should manifest themselves in anomalies of velocities of stars in the galaxy, such as the density waves and runaway stars which have orbit periods in resonance with oscillations.

This study focuses on galaxies observed up to redshift approximately at 8, capturing them at early evolutionary stages where their faintness and structural complexity pose challenges for the traditional classification methods. By mitigating observational noise, our approach enables the identification of morphological features, particularly in distinguishing between disk and non-disk galaxy types. We evaluate the denoising performance using standard image quality metrics and demonstrate that the enhanced images lead to improved classification accuracy across multiple deep learning models. Our analysis of a sample of 292 galaxies up to z=7.69 shows 83 galaxies classified as disk-like by the GCNN model with high confidence, of those approximately 70-80 % are of redshifts greater than 3. These findings suggest that disk-like structures can be prevalent in the early universe. The results highlight the potential of VAE-based denoising as a robust pre-processing step for analyzing high-redshift galaxy populations in ongoing astronomical surveys."}

Recently, with the aid of deep learning, gravitational waves have been efficiently and delicately extracted from the noisy data compared with the traditional match-filtering. While most of the relevant studies adopt the data in the time series only, the time-frequency data processing is also in progress due to its several advantages for the waveform denoising. Here, we target the gravitational waves events emitted by binary black hole (BBH) mergers, with their total mass larger than 30 solar masses. For denoising, we propose a deep learning model utilizing the Griffin-Lim algorithm, an existing numerical approach to restore the phase information from the related amplitude spectrogram. This design allows extra attention on the phase recovery by using a priorly denoised amplitude spectrogram. The denoising results fit well in both the amplitude and the phase alignments of the mock injected waveforms. We also apply our model to the real detected events and discover a nice consistency with the simulated template waveforms, especially the high accuracy around the merger stage.

A substantial fraction of dEs are known to harbor central nuclei, which are among the densest stellar systems in the Universe. The large-scale distribution and the underlying origin of nucleated and non-nucleated dEs remain unresolved. Using a state-of-the-art machine learning framework, we systematically scan the Virgo cluster region ($15\\arcdeg \\times 20\\arcdeg$ centered at $R.A. = 187.2\\arcdeg$ and $Dec. = 9.6\\arcdeg$) and construct the largest homogeneous sample of dEs (of total 2,123) with robust nucleus classifications. We find that nucleated dEs are more spatially clustered and exhibit a stronger association with massive galaxies than their non-nucleated counterparts. This suggests that most nucleated dEs likely formed alongside massive galaxies within the cluster (i.e, the in-situ formation). In contrast, non-nucleated dEs are more widely distributed across the cluster and align more closely with Virgo's global potential well, as traced by the cluster's hot gas. This indicates that most non-nucleated dEs originated outside the cluster (i.e, the ex-situ formation) and were later accreted and redistributed within it. Our findings shed new light on how dEs and their central nuclei form and evolve."}

It exhibits exponential decaying tails which contrast to the Levy-like power law behaviour encountered without friction. Such a non-vanishing drift acts as a regulator for the conventional ``forward'' stochastic $δN$-formalism, which is otherwise ill-defined in the unbounded and flat potentials typical of plateau models of inflation. This setup therefore allows us to compare the curvature distribution derived from both approaches, reverse and forward in time. Up to similar exponential tails, we find quantitative differences. In particular, in the classical-like limit of very large drift, the tails become Gaussian but only in the time-reversed picture. As a toy model of eternal inflation, we finally discuss the case of negative drift in which inflation never ends for many field trajectories. The forward approach becomes pathological whereas the reverse formalism gives back a finite curvature distribution with always exponential tails. All these differences end up being related to the very definition of the background which is ambiguous when a classical trajectory does not exist."}

In this work, we quantify the cosmological parameter biases that arise when using a combination of galaxy clustering and weak-lensing data-vectors, the so-called 3x2pt analysis, from an $f(R)$ galaxy mock under the incorrect assumption of GR, using for the first time high-fidelity full-sky galaxy mock catalogues. We employ a pair of twin simulations: one with GR and one with Hu--Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity with $|f_{R0}| = 10^{-5}$. The mocks are built using an HOD method to populate the dark matter haloes with galaxies, calibrated against SDSS observations at low redshift. Using conservative scale cuts to minimise modelling uncertainties, we perform 3x2pt analyses and infer cosmological parameters through nested sampling, validating our pipeline with the GR mock. Our results show that when analysing the $f(R)$ galaxy mock assuming GR, the recovered cosmological parameters are very significantly biased, even when considering conservative scale cuts: the Figure of Bias reaches $\\sim12σ$ for both $\\{Ω_{\\rm m}, σ_8\\}$ and $S_8$. These biases persist even when marginalising over the galaxy bias and baryonic feedback, demonstrating that nuisance parameters cannot absorb the effects of modified gravity. We conclude that incorrectly assuming GR in a universe governed by $f(R)$ gravity leads to severe and detectable biases in cosmological inference for Stage-IV surveys."}

Traditional spectral line analysis relies heavily on manual intervention, which becomes impractical when handling the massive datasets produced by modern facilities like ALMA. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel deep reinforcement learning framework to automate spectral line fitting. Using observational data from ALMA, we train a neural network that maps both molecular spectroscopic data and observed spectra to physical parameters such as excitation temperature and column density. The neural network predictions can serve as initial estimates and be further refined using a local optimizer. Our method achieves consistent fitting results compared to global optimization with multiple runs, while reducing the number of forward modeling runs by an order of magnitude. We apply our method to pixel-level fitting for an observation of the G327.3-0.6 hot core and validate our results using XCLASS.

We estimate the star formation rate (SFR) by combining the Galaxy Evolution Explorer near-ultraviolet and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer 12 $μ$m imaging data to examine the relationship between molecular gas and SFR densities on scales of several hundred parsecs. We find that the power-law slope of the molecular SFL ranges from 0.62 to 1.08, with an average value of N$=0.81\\pm0.18$, increasing to N$=0.87\\pm0.05$ when excluding galaxies with poorly constrained CO data. These results are roughly consistent with values observed in massive spiral galaxies, suggesting a universal molecular SFL when analyzed with sufficient resolution and sensitivity. Radial profiles of the Toomre $Q$ parameter remain close to unity across the disks, with minimal radial variation, consistent with a self-regulated star formation model. Our results suggest that, despite their lower mass and metallicity, star formation in dwarf galaxies is governed by the same fundamental physical processes as in larger systems.

Specifically, we measure the conditional average density, defined as the average density of galaxies observed around a typical galaxy in the sample. To minimize boundary effects, we adopt a conservative criterion: only galaxies for which a spherical volume of radius $r$, centered on them, is fully contained within the survey footprint are included in the computation. For the BGS, we construct four volume-limited subsamples in order to eliminate biases arising from luminosity-dependent selection effects. By contrast, the LRGS is approximately volume-limited by design. The resulting samples span different depths, providing an opportunity to test the stability of statistical measurements across survey volumes of increasing size. Our results show that the conditional average density follows a power-law decay, $\\langle n(r) \\rangle \\propto r^{-0.8}$, without exhibiting any transition to homogeneity within the survey volume. The large statistics of the DESI samples also allow us to demonstrate that finite-size effects become significant as $r$ approaches the boundaries of the sample volumes. Consistently, we find that the distribution of density fluctuations follows a Gumbel distribution - characteristic of extreme-value statistics - rather than a Gaussian distribution, which would be expected for a spatially homogeneous field. These findings confirm and extend the trends previously observed in smaller redshift surveys, supporting the conclusion that the galaxy distribution does not undergo a transition to spatial homogeneity within the probed scales, up to $r \\sim 400$~\\text{Mpc}/$h$."}

The abundances were determined under the assumption of the local thermodynamic equilibrium by fitting synthetic spectra. The abundances of Mo were derived from the Mo I lines at 5506 and 5533 A, the abundances of Ru were determined from Ru I lines at 4584, and 4757 A. For most of the giant stars observed in this work, Mo and Ru abundances were determined for the first time. We compare our observations with the signatures from different nucleosynthesis processes. Both the [Mo/Fe] and [Ru/Fe] in our stars show a decreasing trend with respect to increasing [Fe/H]. This pattern is similar to that of [Zr/Fe], whereas [Sr/Fe] exhibits a relatively flat trend with metallicity. Compared to the s-process ratios, all stars show a lower [Zr/Mo] and a higher [Ru/Mo], as expected from classical nucleosynthesis. Still, it is unclear if additional contributions from neutrino-wind components or the i-process is needed to explain the observed scatter of [Zr/Mo] and [Ru/Mo] in the Milky Way disk. Indeed, such a dispersion is consistent with the variations also seen in r-II stars at low metallicity and could therefore result from the combined contributions of r-process and s-process to galactic chemical evolution. The observed [Zr/Mo] and [Ru/Mo] scatter in r-II stars should be constrained by future investigations to define if any contributions of additional nucleosynthesis components are needed."}

Here, we assemble a large (~14,000) sample of post-coalescence galaxies that have recently completed their merger-induced star formation, and compare various measurements of central stellar mass with a matched control sample. Specifically, we quantify (at fixed redshift, star formation rate and total stellar mass) the stellar mass enhancement within a fixed angular aperture (Delta M_{star,fibre}) and in the galactic bulge (Delta M_{star,bulge}), finding burst mass fractions of 10 -- 20 %. 61 galaxies in our sample are at z<0.05 and have integral field unit data from the Mapping Galaxies at Apache Point (MaNGA) survey, allowing further kpc-scale assessment of excess stellar mass and radial gradients. Again, we find a ~15 -- 20 % excess of stellar mass in the central regions of the post-mergers compared with matched controls. However, contrary to previous works, which have inferred very compact, centralized merger-induced mass growth, we find a 15 % stellar mass excess out to ~7 kpc (1.4 R_e for the stellar masses in our sample). Our work represents the first direct measurement of merger-induced stellar mass that is independent of stellar population modelling, or fitting light profiles, demonstrating significant and extended mass build-up in late stage post-mergers."}

We estimate possible amplitude and frequency of such oscillations assuming that the offset of the centers of mass is small as compared with the size of the galaxy. Such oscillations, if exist, should manifest themselves in anomalies of velocities of stars in the galaxy, such as the density waves and runaway stars which have orbit periods in resonance with oscillations.

This vector-tensor theory enjoys stable homogeneous and isotropic solutions characterized by an effective dark energy fluid, with behavior that ranges from freezing quintessential to thawing phantom-like, serving as a motivated framework to scrutinize the cosmological tensions that affect the standard $Λ$CDM model. While the model we consider is sufficiently generic to encompass a large class of field theories, it distinguishes itself from scalar dark energy models (quintessential ones, kinetic ones and non-minimally coupled ones) by the presence of what would be classed as a vector degree of freedom which can be for instance inherited from more generic theories of gravity. We improve on previous work in several directions: we consider a general one-parameter class of background models; identify a so-called 'special' model and analyze observational constraints taking also into account perturbations and making use of wide up-to-date catalogs of datasets including recently released ones. We find that the one-parameter Proca-Nuevo model is preferred over $Λ$CDM at $1.5σ$ when fitting CMB and BAO data, and at $2.4σ$ when further adding low-redshift data. The Hubble tension is alleviated, dropping from $5.8σ$ to $2.3σ$ (resp. $1.5σ$) between CMB with (and resp. without) BAO data and local measurements. On the other hand, we find that the vector field generically introduces a significant enhancement of the effective Newton constant, so that matching the observed matter power spectrum requires a mild amount of tuning to suppress the impact of perturbations. Since, at the background level, Proca-Nuevo is degenerate with other classes of theories, our results are also relevant to a wider range of set-ups including and beyond vector-tensor models."}

Our work also presents the first measurements of relevant non-minimal cosmological parameters from the combination of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and DESI full-shape (FS) data, which are made possible thanks to carefully chosen priors on EFT parameters. We find that the addition the FS likelihood to DESI's baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data improves the limits on the spatial curvature by a factor of two over the BAO only results, though the improvements are less significant with the CMB data. The dark energy equation of state figure-of-merit increases both with and without the supernovae data (SNe), by $\\approx30\\%$ and $\\approx20\\%$ relative to the CMB+BAO and CMB+BAO+SNe results, respectively. Our FS likelihood also yields the strongest CMB-independent constraint on the total neutrino mass $M_ν<0.32\\,{\\rm eV}$, with the $30\\%$ improvement due to the bispectrum. In combination with the CMB, we find a $14\\%$ improvement assuming the $Λ$CDM+$M_ν$ model (yielding $M_ν<0.059\\,{\\rm eV}$), but this increases to $22\\%$ when using non-minimal backgrounds: $M_ν<0.097\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $oΛ$CDM+$M_ν$ and $M_ν<0.13\\,{\\rm eV}$ in $w_0w_a$CDM+$M_ν$. Overall, our work illustrates that robust and substantial gains in constraining power can be obtained by incorporating the FS power spectrum and bispectrum measurements in analyses of non-minimal cosmological models."}

The evolution of the effective equation of state induced by EUP corrections is analyzed and characterized using the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization. We then examine the fulfillment of classical energy conditions, including the null, weak, strong, and dominant conditions. The dynamical and thermodynamic stability of the model is investigated, showing that the EUP cosmology admits a late-time de Sitter attractor. Finally, we evaluate the effective speed of sound associated with the model and discuss implications for perturbative stability. Our findings indicate that EUP-induced corrections can produce a consistent late-time acceleration without requiring a cosmological constant."}

While previous work has focused on point-like lenses such as primordial black holes, we extend this framework to extended dark objects (EDOs), including ultracompact minihalos formed from the collapse of primordial overdensities. We develop an analytic model of microlensing by EDOs embedded in a macrolensing cluster potential and derive the resulting caustics and light curves. Depending on the EDO size relative to the effective Einstein radius, we show that they may generate additional narrow caustics, leading to novel features in the light curve. Applying our framework to the MACS J1149 LS1 ``Icarus'' event, we constrain EDOs with radii up to $10^7 R_\\odot$. Our results demonstrate that caustic-crossing events complement galactic microlensing searches, as they can probe EDOs with larger physical size. We discuss the implications for current and future observations, which promise to deliver a statistical sample of caustic transients and correspondingly sharper constraints on dark objects."}

These observations spanned pre-perihelion heliocentric distances ($r_H$) of 2.6 -- 1.7 au. The molecules showed outgassing patterns distinct from one another, with HCN production being depleted in the sunward hemisphere of the coma, whereas CH$_3$OH was enhanced in that direction. Statistical analysis of molecular scale lengths in 3I/ATLAS indicated that CH$_3$OH included production from coma sources at $L_p>258$ km at 99% confidence, although low signal-to-noise on long baselines prevented definitively ruling out CH$_3$OH as purely a parent species. In contrast, HCN production was indistinguishable from direct nucleus sublimation. The CH$_3$OH production rate increased sharply from August through October, including an uptick near the inner edge of the H$_2$O sublimation zone at $r_H$ = 2 au. Compared to comets measured to date at radio wavelengths, the derived CH$_3$OH/HCN ratios in 3I/ATLAS of $124^{+30}_{-34}$ and $79^{+11}_{-14}$ on September 12 and 15, respectively, are among the most enriched values measured in any comet, surpassed only by anomalous solar system comet C/2016 R2 (PanSTARRS)."}

(2024a) from the motion of fast-moving stars in multi-epoch HST observations. We performed PSF-fitting photometry for sources in NIRCam (F200W and F444W) and MIRI (F770W and F1500W) and constructed UV to IR SEDs for sources within the central region of the cluster by using HST photometry from oMEGACat (Haberle et al. 2024b). None of the SEDs of reliably measured sources within this region resembles the SEDs computed from models of Pesce et al. 2021 for IMBHs accreting from intracluster medium at low rates. Our JWST limits place constraints on combinations of IMBH mass and accretion efficiency, either due to the amount of material available to be accreted, or due to the fraction of accreting matter that actually falls into the IMBH. Our non-detection then does not contradict the mass range of the IMBH inferred from the fast moving stars. We discuss these constraints in the context of the model of Pesce et al. 2021. We find that JWST limits are more restrictive than the existing radio limits for IMBH masses $\\lesssim 20,000 M_{\\odot}$. It is also possible that the faint IMBH emission is dominated by the light of a nearby star. Tighter limits on accretion onto the candidate IMBH can be placed with deeper observations, a more precise localization of the IMBH, and better measurements of the local intracluster medium density and temperature at the center of the cluster."}

Since YSOs and AGB stars share similar infrared (IR) photometric characteristics due to comparable temperatures and the presence of circumstellar dust, distinguishing them is challenging and often leads to misclassification. While machine learning and deep learning techniques have helped reduce YSO-AGB misclassifications, achieving a reliable separation remains challenging. Given that YSOs and AGB stars exhibit distinct light curves resulting from different variability mechanisms, our Double Filter Model leverages light curve data to enhance classification accuracy. This approach uncovered YSOs and AGB stars that were misclassified in IR photometry and was validated against Taurus YSOs and spectroscopically confirmed AGB stars. We applied the model to the {\\it Spitzer/IRAC Candidate YSO Catalog for the Inner Galactic Midplane} (SPICY) catalog for catalog refinement and identified potential AGB star contaminants."}

Interstellar and circumstellar matter, 15 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables, in press", "summary": "Shock types of low-velocity molecular outflows are not always well constrained. Astrochemical comparisons are often made between low-velocity and high-velocity outflows, but without considering the question of the shock type. We investigated molecular abundances of post-shock regions to determine whether strong differences between non-irradiated C-type and J-type shocks can be highlighted. One of the main application goals is to diagnose the shock type of the protostellar object L1157 B2 through the use of molecular tracers. We simulated grid sets of shock models with the Paris-Durham Shock code with velocities ranging from 5 to 19 km/s and low densities from $10^2$ to $10^5$ cm$^{-3}$. We computed the desorption percentage of methanol in these simulations and estimated it at higher velocities. We compared our results to observational measurements of L1157 B2 and with a benchmark of four already identified shocks. L1157 B2 has been diagnosed as a non-irradiated C-type shock, and the method showed a good applicability through the benchmark. Methanol formed in the icy mantle of grains can serve to trace the differences between shock types, at least in non-irradiated conditions. A requirement for the applicability of a species as a shock-type tracer is that it does not undergo significant enhancement or destruction, but is mainly impacted by desorption processes under shocked conditions. The desorption percentage of methanol is a good criterion in characterizing the shock type of L1157 B2 and should be investigated as a general method to diagnose the shock type in non-irradiated regions. We identify L1157 B2 as a non-irradiated C-type shock with velocities and densities fitting with previous studies."}

Here we report an unusual X-ray transient, XID 935, discovered in the 7 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South, the deepest X-ray survey ever. XID 935 experienced an overall X-ray dimming by a factor of more than 40 between 1999 and 2016. Not monotonically decreasing during this period, its X-ray luminosity increased by a factor $> 27$ within 2 months, from $L_{\\rm 0.5-7\\ keV}<10^{40.87}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (10 October 2014 -- 4 January 2015) to $L_{\\rm 0.5-7\\ keV}=10^{42.31\\pm 0.20}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (16 March 2015). The X-ray position of XID 935 is located at the center of its host galaxy with a spectroscopic redshift of 0.251, whose optical spectra do not display emission characteristics associated with an active galactic nucleus. The peak 0.5--2.0 keV flux is the faintest among all the X-ray-selected TDE candidates to date. Thanks to a total exposure of $\\sim 9.5$ Ms in the X-ray bands, we manage to secure relatively well-sampled, 20-year-long X-ray light curves of this deepest X-ray-selected TDE candidate. We find that a partial TDE model could not explain the main declining trend. An SMBH binary TDE model is in acceptable accordance with the light curves of XID 935; however, it fails to match short-timescale fluctuations exactly. Therefore, the exceptional observational features of XID 935 provide a key benchmark for refining quantitative TDE models and simulations."}

HERA Phase II constitutes several significant improvements in the signal chain compared to Phase I, most notably resulting in expanded frequency bandwidth, from 50-250 MHz. In these first upper limits, we investigate a small two-week subset of the available Phase II observations, with a focus on identifying new systematic characteristics of the instrument, and establishing an analysis pipeline to account for them. We report 2$σ$ upper limits in eight spectral bands, spanning $5.6 \\leq z \\leq 24.4$ that are consistent with thermal noise at the $2σ$ level for $k \\gtrsim 0.6-0.9 h{\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ (band dependent).
