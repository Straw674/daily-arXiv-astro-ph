Taking full advantage of\nthis computing power requires the development of new algorithms and numerical\nmethods that are GPU friendly and scalable. In the context of multi-fluid\ndust-gas dynamics, we propose a highly accurate algorithm that is specifically\ndesigned for GPUs. We developed a multi-fluid gas-dust algorithm capable of\ncomputing friction terms on GPU architectures to machine precision, with the\nconstraint for the drag-time step to remain a fraction of the global\nhydrodynamic time step for computational efficiency in practice. We present a\nscaling-and-squaring algorithm tailored to modern architectures for computing\nthe exponential of the drag matrix, enabling high accuracy in friction\ncalculations across relevant astrophysical regimes. The algorithm was validated\nthrough the Dustybox Dustywave and Dustyshock tests. The algorithm was\nimplemented and tested in two multi-GPU codes with different architectures and\nGPU programming models: Dyablo, an adaptive mesh refinement code based on the\nKokkos library, and Shamrock, a multi-method code based on Sycl. On current\narchitectures, the friction computation remains acceptable for both codes\n(below the typical hydro time step) up to 16 species, enabling a further\nimplementation of growth and fragmentation.

The interpretation of large-scale weak lensing maps,\nas well as the estimation of galaxy clustering, requires reliable redshifts\nwith high precision for multi-band photometry. However, obtaining spectroscopy\nfor billions of galaxies is impractical and complex; therefore, having a\nsufficiently large number of galaxies with spectroscopic observations to train\nsupervised algorithms for accurate redshift estimation is a significant\nchallenge and an open research area.

At this radius, the best-fit gas density is 2.5e-5 cm^-3, corresponding\nto a baryon overdensity of 30. By integrating the gas density profile out to\nr200m, we infer a gas fraction of 90% of the universal baryon fraction with the\nassumption of a typical halo concentration, indicating the completeness of the\nbaryon budget within large radii. Additionally, we examine the hot gas\ndistribution in massive clusters in the IllustrisTNG simulations from the halo\ncenter to the accretion region. This analysis reveals differences in radial gas\nprofiles depending on whether the direction probes voids or nearby cosmic\nfilaments. Beyond r200m, the density profile along the filament direction\nexceeds that along the void direction. This pattern aligns with the observed\ntransition radius between the one-halo and two-halo terms, suggesting that\nr200m is the approximate radius marking the location at which cosmic filaments\nconnect to galaxy clusters.

Yet, similar techniques may be implemented\nin the terahertz (THz) and mid-infrared (MIR) regions, such as optical\nrectification for comb generation and electro-optic sampling for detection,\nboth using crystals with quadratic nonlinearity. However, in the Reststrahlen\nband near phonon resonances in these crystals, typically between 5 and 10 THz,\nboth linear and nonlinear susceptibilities experience abnormally high\ndispersion, and light propagation is strongly suppressed.

Due to resolution limitations, accurately measuring WL on\narcsecond scales is highly challenging. In this work, we evaluate the LoS\neffects on both lensing images and time-delay measurements using a more\nstraightforward, high-resolution N-body simulation that provides a more\nrealistic matter distribution compared to the traditional, computationally\ncheaper halo rendering method. We employ the multi-plane ray tracing technique,\nwhich is traditionally utilized to compute WL effects at the arcminute scale,\nextending its application to the strong lensing regime at the arcsecond scale.\nWe focus on the quadruple-image system and present the following findings: 1.\nIn addition to a constant external convergence, large-scale structures within a\nregion approximately 2 arcminutes in angular size act as external perturbers,\ninducing inhomogeneous fluctuations on the arcsecond scale; 2.

The\npreference for evolving dark energy is consistent with the DESI-DR2 findings:\nwhen combining BAO, primary CMB, and weak lensing data, the $w_0w_a$CDM is\npreferred at about the $3\\sigma$ significance. However, when we add SN, the\nresult is sensitive to the choice of data: if we leave out $z<0.1$ SN data in\nthe analysis, as a test of the effect of inhomogeneous calibration, we obtain a\nstatistical significance below $2\\sigma$ for time evolving dark energy. Indeed,\nthe high-z only SN data \\textbf{lowers} the evidence for evolving dark energy\nin all the data combinations we have examined. This underscores the importance\nof improved SN samples at low redshift and of alternative data combinations. We\nshow that cosmic shear measurements with LSST Year 1 data will provide\ncomparable power to current SN data. We discuss other low-redshift probes\nprovided by lensing and galaxy clustering to test for evolving dark energy."}

Observational evidence suggests a possible\nevolutionary link between MQs and dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs; or\nsubmillimetre galaxies), another extreme high-redshift population. However,\ngalaxy formation models have historically struggled to reproduce these\npopulations - especially simultaneously - limiting our understanding of their\nformation and connection, particularly in light of recent JWST findings.

In this work, we use this new\nmodel to investigate the progenitors of MQs at z > 2 and the physical\nmechanisms that lead to their quenching. We find that most MQs at z > 2 were\nsub-millimetre-bright ($S_{870}$ > 1 mJy) at some point in their cosmic past.\nThe stellar mass of MQs is strongly correlated with the maximum submillimetre\nflux density attained over their history, and this relation appears to be\nindependent of redshift. However, only a minority of high-redshift DSFGs evolve\ninto MQs by z = 2. The key distinction between typical DSFGs and MQ progenitors\nlies in their merger histories: MQ progenitors experience an early major merger\nthat triggers a brief, intense starburst and rapid black hole growth, depleting\ntheir cold gas reservoirs. In our model, AGN feedback subsequently prevents\nfurther gas cooling, resulting in quenching. In contrast, the broader DSFG\npopulation remains sub-millimetre-bright, with star formation proceeding\nprimarily via secular processes, becoming quenched later."}

We investigate whether their presence leaves measurable imprints on\nthe projected stellar density fields of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs).\nBuilding on literature $N$-body experiments, we show that subhalo interactions\ninduce subtle out-of-equilibrium fluctuations appearing as density\ncorrugations. In a CDM framework, these fluctuations are dominated by the most\nmassive subhalos in the host halo. We develop a Fourier-based framework to\nquantify these features, identifying characteristic peaks in the spatial\nfrequency spectrum that are well described by Voigt profiles. The peak\nparameters are sensitive to both the subhalo mass function and the number of\nstellar tracers. For the configurations tested, $N_{\\star} \\sim 10^5$ stars\nsuffice to detect subhalo populations with $M_{\\rm subhalo} \\lesssim\n10^6~\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, while larger masses produce stronger and more complex\nsignatures. We assess the feasibility of this technique by analyzing Gaia and\nHST data: in this context, the Fornax dwarf shows residual low-frequency\nstructures resembling those in our controlled subhalo experiments, making it an\ninteresting case for follow-up. Prospectively, wide-field surveys such as\nEuclid, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, and the Vera C. Rubin\nObservatory are expected to deliver stellar samples of $N_{\\star} \\sim 10^5$\nper dwarf, offering compelling prospects for probing subhalo imprints. Our\nresults introduce a novel pathway to constrain the subhalo mass function in\ndSphs, and motivate follow-up work that incorporates alternative DM models and\nadditional dynamical perturbations."}

Submitted to PASP", "summary": "Calcium-rich gap transients are a faint, fast-evolving class of supernovae\nthat show strong nebular Ca emission lines. Their progenitor systems are\nuncertain, but they are often associated with old and quiescent host galaxies.\nIn this work, we compare the properties of the hosts of hydrogen-poor Ca-rich\ngap transients to the hosts of 3 other classes of supernova (SNe): normal Type\nIa, 91bg-like, and Type II. We use data from the Zwicky Transient Facility\n(ZTF) Census of the Local Universe (CLU) experiment to build up our 4 SNe\nsamples and identify the host galaxies. A combination of precomputed host\nproperties from the CLU catalog and those derived from SED fitting are used to\ncharacterize each host's stellar mass, star formation rate, and specific star\nformation rate (sSFR). We find that the hosts of Ca-rich gap transients and\n91bg-like SNe occupy a similar parameter space of mass and sSFR, and are more\nmassive and quiescent compared to the hosts of Type Ia and Type II SNe.\nAdditionally, we construct delay time distributions (DTDs) for our 4 samples,\nfinding that Ca-rich gap transients and 91bg-like SNe have the longest peak\ndelay times $\\sim 10^4$ Myr, compared to the peak delay times of Type Ia SNe\n($\\sim 10^3$ Myr) and Type II SNe ($\\sim 10$ Myr). The similarity of host\nenvironment and DTDs for Ca-rich gap transients and 91bg-like SNe motivates\nfurther analysis of the relationship of these two transient classes."}

Here we adopt a toy model previously used in\nasymptotically flat spacetimes to show that, for given values of the\nover-density and the mean curvature, solutions to the Hamiltonian constraint\nneed not exist, and if they do exist they are not unique. Specifically, pairs\nof solutions exist on two branches, corresponding to strong-field and\nweak-field solutions, that join at a maximum beyond which solutions cease to\nexist. As a result, there is a limit to the extent to which an over-density can\nbe balanced by intrinsic rather than extrinsic curvature on the initial slice.\nEven below this limit, iterative methods to construct initial data may converge\nto solutions on either one of the two branches, depending on the starting\nguess, leading to potentially inconsistent physical results in the evolution."}

Three dust filaments ($\\sim$4000 au in length) are\nfound in the HH 211 protostellar envelope, two of which are aligned with\ncore-scale ($\\sim$10,000 au) magnetic fields detected by previous JCMT\nobservations.

In the inner envelope ($\\sim$1000 au), we\ndetect a clear hourglass-shaped magnetic field morphology near the protostar\nand toroidal fields along the outflow directions. We also estimate the\nline-of-sight-averaged temperature and column density distributions in the\ninner envelope and find that the temperature is higher in the east, while the\ncolumn density is enhanced in the southern and western regions. The southern\ndense regions of the inner envelope may trace either outflow cavity walls, due\nto their alignment with the outflow, or possible infalling channels in the\nmidplane, given the close correspondence between the observed magnetic fields\nand the predicted infall trajectories."}

Accepted by A&A Letter", "summary": "CSS100217 is considered a peculiar tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate\noccurring in an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Unlike typical TDEs, where the\npost-flare luminosity is equal to that pre-flare, CSS100217 decayed to $\\sim$\n0.4 magnitudes fainter than its pre-flare V band level. In this manuscript, we\npropose an obscured TDE model to explain the light curve of CSS100217. Assuming\nthat the time-dependent obscuration, caused by the TDE unbound stellar debris,\nor by nuclear clouds moving around the supermassive black hole (SMBH), follows\na Weibull distribution, we find that the light curve of CSS100217 can be\ndescribed by the tidal disruption of a $4.6_{-0.9}^{+0.9}{\\rm M_\\odot}$\nmain-sequence star by a $3.3_{-0.3}^{+0.3}\\times10^7{\\rm M_\\odot}$ black hole.\nThe total energy of the event derived from our fit is $7.23\\times10^{53}$ ergs\nand about 1.38 ${\\rm M_\\odot}$ of debris mass is accreted by the central SMBH.\nThe model indicates that the contribution of the host galaxy to the observed\npre-flare optical luminosity is not-significant compared to that of the AGN,\nwhich is consistent with the results of the spectral analysis. These results\nsuggest that obscuration may play an important role in explaining the unusual\nTDE-like variability observed in CSS100217."}

These sources are considered to be redback candidates based\non their eclipsing variability, steep negative spectral indices, and potential\nFermi $\\gamma$-ray associations, with GPM J1723-33 and GPM J1815-14 lying\nwithin a Fermi 95% error ellipse. Follow-up pulsation searches with MeerKAT\nconfirmed pulsations from GPM J1723-33, while the non-detections of the other\nthree are likely due to scattering by material ablated from their companion\nstars. We identify possible orbital periods by applying folding algorithms to\nthe light curves and determine that all sources have short orbital periods (<24\nhours), consistent with redback spider systems. Following up on the sources at\nmultiple radio frequencies revealed that the sources exhibit\nfrequency-dependent eclipses, with longer eclipses observed at lower\nfrequencies. We place broad constraints on the eclipse medium, ruling out\ninduced Compton scattering and cyclotron absorption. Three sources are\nspatially consistent with optical sources in the Dark Energy Camera Plane\nSurvey imaging, which may contain the optical counterparts. Each field is\naffected by strong dust extinction, and follow-up with large telescopes is\nneeded to identify the true counterparts. Identifying potential radio\ncounterparts to four previously unassociated Fermi sources brings us closer to\nunderstanding the origin of the unexplained $\\gamma$-ray excess in the Galactic\nCentre."}

These atoms are most likely\nreleased from the surface of the comet's nucleus or from a short-lived parent.\nThe presence of these lines in cometary spectra is unexpected because the\nsurface blackbody equilibrium temperature is too low to allow the sublimation\nof refractory minerals containing these metals. These lines were also found in\nthe interstellar comet 2I/Borisov which has a NiI/FeI abundance ratio similar\nto that observed in solar system comets. On average, this ratio is one order of\nmagnitude higher than the solar Ni/Fe abundance ratio. Here, we report\nobservations of the new interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which were carried out\nwith the ESO Very Large Telescope equipped with the UVES spectrograph. Spectra\nwere obtained at six epochs, at heliocentric distances ranging from 3.14 to\n2.14 au. NiI was detected at all epochs. FeI was only detected at heliocentric\ndistances smaller than 2.64 au. We estimated the NiI and FeI production rates\nby comparing the observed line intensities with those produced by a\nfluorescence model. Comet 3I exhibits a high production rate of NiI atoms as\nwell as a high NiI/FeI ratio, making it exceptional when compared to solar\nsystem comets and 2I/Borisov. Additionally, we found that the NiI/FeI ratio\ndecreases rapidly with decreasing heliocentric distance, suggesting that comet\n3I could soon become indistinguishable from solar system comets in this\nrespect. We interpreted these observations assuming that the NiI and FeI atoms\nwere released through the sublimation of Ni(CO)$_4$ and Fe(CO)$_5$ carbonyls,\nwhich supports the presence of these species in the cometary material."}
