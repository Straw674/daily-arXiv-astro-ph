### [1] [Cosmological Simulations of Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08925)
*Robert Feldmann,Rebekka Bieri*

**TL;DR**: 综述了宇宙学星系模拟的发展历程、关键物理过程建模方法及未来趋势，揭示了计算机模拟在理解星系形成演化中的重要作用。

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系形成与演化的多物理过程数值模拟研究。

Data: 数据来源于宇宙大爆炸后的初始条件，通过整合引力、气体动力学、冷却、恒星形成和反馈等物理过程进行模拟。

Method: 采用多物理耦合数值模拟方法整合引力、气体动力学、冷却、恒星形成及反馈等关键过程。

Result: 现代宇宙学星系模拟整合了引力、气体动力学、冷却、恒星形成和反馈等多物理过程，结合宇宙膨胀和结构形成，实现了从大爆炸后初始条件到星系形成与演化的高精度数值建模。

Abstract: Galaxy simulations have come a long way from the early days of simple N-body
calculations, which considered only gravitational interactions, to the complex,
multi-physics models used today. Beginning with initial conditions
representative of the Universe shortly after the Big Bang, these modern
simulations integrate the relevant physical processes involved in galaxy
formation, such as gravity, gas dynamics, cooling, star formation, and
feedback, while accounting for cosmic expansion and structure formation. This
review provides an introductory overview of cosmological galaxy simulations,
outlining the essential components and methods used to model the formation and
evolution of galaxies on the computer. It also discusses common steps in the
post-processing analysis, essential for extracting physical insights from these
numerical experiments, along with basic tests to assess simulation validity and
accuracy. Looking forward, next-generation simulations aim to push resolution
boundaries, incorporate additional physical processes, and improve the
robustness of the numerical models, promising to lead to a deeper understanding
of how galaxies emerged and evolved over cosmic time.

### [2] [Ruling out dominant electron scattering in Little Red Dots' Rosetta Stone using multiple hydrogen lines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08929)
*Matilde Brazzini,Francesco D'Eugenio,Roberto Maiolino,Ignas Juodžbalis,Xihan Ji,Jan Scholtz*

**TL;DR**: 发现"Rosetta Stone"活动星系核中Hα、Hβ和Paβ谱线轮廓差异，反驳了电子散射模型普遍适用性及黑洞质量系统性高估观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 探讨活动星系核中小红点天体宽发射线起源及其对黑洞质量估算的影响。

Data: 数据来源于对红移z=2.26的最亮已知LRD天体"Rosetta Stone"AGN中氢复合线Hα、Hβ和Paβ的观测分析。

Method: 采用氢复合谱线联合分析及多种指数模型测试方法。

Result: 观测到的Hα、Hβ和Paβ谱线轮廓差异表明，BLR周围电离介质电子散射模型无法普遍适用于LRDs和AGN。

Abstract: The majority of Little Red Dots (LRDs) hosting Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)
exhibits broad H$\alpha$ emission, which recent studies propose originates from
scattering off free electrons within an ionized and dense medium embedding the
Broad Line Region (BLR), rather than directly from the BLR itself. This model
suggests that the observed broad lines may be intrinsically narrower than
observed, which would lead to black hole masses that are up to two orders of
magnitude smaller than what inferred when assuming that the whole broad line
comes from the BLR. To test this model, we present a joint analysis of multiple
hydrogen recombination lines in the ''Rosetta Stone''AGN, the brightest known
LRD at $z$=2.26. We show that H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Pa$\beta$ have different
spectral profiles, which is inconsistent with the predictions of the simple
electron scattering scenario. Additionally, we test a variety of exponential
models and show that none of them can simultaneously reproduce all three line
profiles with physically plausible parameters. The inadequacy of these models
for the Rosetta Stone implies that the scenario of electron scattering by an
ionized medium surrounding the BLR is not universally applicable to LRDs and
AGN, and therefore provides a counterexample to the claim of a universal and
systematic overestimation of black hole masses.

### [3] [The incidence of X-ray AGN and non-AGN galaxies in the far-infrared: insights into host galaxy properties and AGN obscuration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08935)
*G. Mountrichas,F. J. Carrera,I. Georgantopoulos,S. Mateos,A. Ruiz,A. Corral*

**TL;DR**: 研究发现X射线活动星系核（AGN）的远红外探测率与恒星质量和特定恒星形成率无关，而随特定黑洞吸积率下降，表明AGN倾向于存在于气体丰富环境中，其反馈机制长期调控而非突然抑制恒星形成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究活动星系核（AGN）与寄主星系恒星形成活动在富气体环境中的共存关系及其反馈机制。

Data: 数据来源于五个外场（COSMOS、XMM-LSS、Stripe82、ELAIS-S1和CDFS-SWIRE）的光学至远红外测光数据，并利用4XMM-DR11s目录量化X射线吸收。

Method: 采用光学至远红外测光构建光谱能量分布（SED）来推导宿主星系性质并评估AGN遮蔽程度。

Result: X射线活动星系核在恒星形成率和特定黑洞吸积率下表现出平坦的远红外探测率，表明其存在于气体丰富环境中，支持反馈机制长期调节而非突然抑制恒星形成的观点。

Abstract: We investigate the far-infrared (far-IR) incidence of X-ray-selected active
galactic nuclei (AGN) and non-AGN galaxies as a function of stellar mass
(M$_*$), star formation rate (SFR), and specific black hole accretion rate
($\lambda_{\text{sBHAR}}$), using data from five extragalactic fields (COSMOS,
XMM-LSS, Stripe82, ELAIS-S1, and CDFS-SWIRE). We construct spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) from optical-to-far-IR photometry to derive host galaxy
properties and assess AGN obscuration. X-ray absorption is quantified using the
4XMM-DR11s catalog. Our final sample includes 172,697 non-AGN galaxies (53%
Herschel-detected) and 2,417 X-ray AGN (73% Herschel-detected), with $10 <
log\,[M_*/M_\sun] < 12$ and $0 < z < 2$. X-ray AGN exhibit a relatively flat
far-IR detection rate across stellar mass and specific SFR ($sSFR = SFR /
M_*$), unlike non-AGN galaxies, where detection correlates strongly with SFR.
Among AGN, far-IR detection declines with increasing $\lambda_{\text{sBHAR}}$,
despite rising SFR. Our results suggest X-ray AGN are preferentially found in
gas-rich environments, where star formation and black hole accretion coexist.
Far-IR incidence remains high across all sSFR bins, supporting a scenario in
which AGN feedback regulates, rather than abruptly quenches, star formation.
Comparing AGN and non-AGN SFRs without separating Herschel-detected from
non-detected sources introduces biases. Obscured AGN show ~10% higher far-IR
detection rates than unobscured ones, yet at similar $\lambda_{\text{sBHAR}}$,
unobscured AGN tend to have higher SFR. This may suggest obscured AGN inhabit
dustier systems with moderate star formation contributing to the far-IR. Our
findings support a regulatory AGN feedback mode operating over extended
timescales in gas-rich galaxies.

### [4] [Finding Halos in the Lyman-$α$ forest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08940)
*Duarte Muñoz Santos,Matthew M. Pieri,Dylan Nelson,Simon Weng,Teng Hu,Manuel F. Ruiz-Herrera Bernal*

**TL;DR**: 利用莱曼α森林中的强混合吸收特征追踪星系晕，发现吸收强度与红移越低、晕质量越高相关，最高达78%概率对应10^12.25太阳质量晕，并通过分级框架将吸收体尺寸拓展至54-483 km/s，实现从10^9.5到10^11.5太阳质量晕的高效探测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 探索莱曼α森林中吸收系统与暗物质晕的关联及其作为晕探测工具的潜力。

Data: 使用了来自TNG50宇宙学模拟的数百万条合成吸收光谱数据，包括z=2和z=3时的SDSS类似分辨率光谱和高分辨率光谱。

Method: 利用TNG50宇宙学模拟生成数百万条合成吸收光谱，结合SDSS类似分辨率和高分辨率光谱分析，探索并优化强混合莱曼α吸收系统作为晕族探测器的定义与性能。

Result: 通过SBLA吸收系统可追踪隐藏在莱曼α森林中的星系，其中78%位于晕中，吸收越强、红移越低则概率越高，且晕质量均值达10^12.25太阳质量。

Abstract: It has been demonstrated that one can track down galaxies in absorption
'hidden' in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest through the use of 'strong, blended
Lyman-$\alpha$' (or SBLA) absorption. Specifically a series of publications
studied SBLA absorption systems with Lyman-$\alpha$ flux transmission, $F_{Ly
\alpha} < 0.25$ on scales of 138 km s$^{-1}$ in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS). In order to better understand the connection between halos and these
SBLAs, we make use of several million synthetic absorption spectra from the
TNG50 cosmological simulation, at z=2 and z=3. We explore spectra with
SDSS-like resolution in order to understand the nature of SBLAs as defined thus
far, as well as with high resolution (or 'resolved') spectra to generalise and
optimise SBLAs as halo finders. For the SDSS SBLAs, we find that up to 78% of
these absorption systems reside in hlaos, where the stronger the absorption and
the lower the redshift, the higher the probability. We also manage to recover a
mean halo mass of $10^{12.25} M_{\odot}$, in line with what is measured in
observations. For the resolved SBLAs, we expand on the previous definition and
allow the SBLA spectra size to vary between 54 km s$^{-1}$ and 483 km s$^{-1}$.
We find that the largest absorbers have the highest probability of finding
halos. When applying a hierarchical framework, where we allow the largest SBLAs
to consume the smaller ones, we find that the halo mass distributions for each
SBLA spectral size becomes narrower with respect to the non-hierarchical case.
We are also able to probe halo masses from $M_h \approx 10^{9.5} M_{\odot}$
(for 100 km s$^{-1}$ SBLAs) to $M_h \approx 10^{11.5} M_{\odot}$ (for 450 km
s$^{-1}$ SBLAs). With these results, we show that we are able to transform the
Lyman-$\alpha$ forest into a powerful halo finding machine for not only
identifying CGM regions, but also estimating their host halo masses.

### [5] [Star Formation Histories of Early-type Dwarfs in Group Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08975)
*Hong Bae Ann,Mira Seo,Myoungwon Jeon*

**TL;DR**: 研究发现早期型矮星系的恒星形成历史主要由形态决定，环境起次要作用，其中红色矮星系（dS0、dE、dSph）早期快速形成恒星并迅速停止，蓝色矮星系（dEbc、dEbl）则呈现持续恒星形成和极低金属丰度特征，且低质量星系的环境依赖性更显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 探讨早期型矮星系形态与环境对其恒星形成历史和化学富集过程的共同影响。

Data: 使用SDSS光谱数据通过starlight代码进行全光谱拟合。

Method: 采用SDSS光谱的全光谱拟合技术结合starlight代码分析恒星形成历史和化学富集模式。

Result: 星族形成历史主要由形态决定，环境因素起次要但不可忽视的作用。

Abstract: We investigate the star formation histories (SFHs) of 983 early-type dwarf
galaxies classified into five morphological subtypes, dS0, dE, dEbc, dSph, and
dEbl,across six environments ranging from the field to rich clusters such as
Ursa Major and Virgo. Using full spectral fitting of SDSS spectra with the
starlight code, we derive detailed SFHs and chemical enrichment patterns. We
find that SFHs are primarily shaped by morphology, with environment playing a
secondary but non-negligible role. Red early-type dwarfs (dS0, dE, dSph)
typically formed most of their stars early and quenched rapidly, whereas blue
early-type dwarfs (dEbc, dEbl) exhibit extended or ongoing star formation and
host extremely metal-poor stars, suggesting continued pristine gas accretion.
Environmental dependence is clearest in low-mass systems: field galaxies often
show prolonged SFHs and delayed enrichment, while Virgo Cluster galaxies tend
to quench earlier and enrich more rapidly. Cumulative SFHs reinforce these
trends, with dSph galaxies showing the earliest quenching and least
environmental dependence, indicating a likely primordial origin. Metallicity
evolution also varies with mass and environment, progressing most slowly in
low-mass field galaxies and most rapidly in high-mass cluster galaxies. Our
results highlight the combined influence of morphology, stellar mass, and
environment on the evolutionary diversity of early-type dwarfs, and suggest
that both internal processes (nature) and external conditions (nurture) are
intricately linked in shaping their star formation and chemical enrichment
histories.

### [6] [Little Red Dots As Late-stage Quasi-stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09085)
*Mitchell C. Begelman,Jason Dexter*

**TL;DR**: 研究发现詹姆斯韦伯太空望远镜观测到的"小红点"是演化后期的准恒星，由超大质量恒星核心坍缩形成，中心黑洞质量超过总质量的10%，具有红色光谱、强巴尔默跳变和电子散射展宽的巴尔默线，且X射线被抑制，表明大多数或所有超大质量黑洞在形成和生长过程中经历了准恒星/小红点阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 探讨詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜发现的"小红点"可能是超大质量恒星核心坍缩后形成的准恒星演化末期的产物。

Data: 数据来源于詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜观测到的"小红点"（LRDs）以及模拟的准恒星晚期演化模型。

Method: 采用晚期准恒星模型分析热力学和辐射特性，预测光谱特征与小红点相似。

Result: "小红色斑点"是晚期准恒星，由超大质量恒星核心坍缩形成，包含以超爱丁顿速率吸积物质的黑洞，具有红色、强巴尔默跳变和电子散射加宽的巴尔默线特征。

Abstract: We argue that the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered with the James Webb
Space Telescope are quasi-stars in their late stages of evolution. Quasi-stars
are hypothetical objects predicted to form following the core collapse of
supermassive stars, and consist of black holes accreting from massive envelopes
at a super-Eddington rate. We show that models of late-stage quasi-stars, with
black hole masses exceeding $\sim 10\%$ of the total, predict thermal and
radiative properties that are insensitive to both black hole and envelope mass,
and spectrally resemble LRDs. Specifically, we show that they are likely to
exhibit reddish colors, a strong Balmer break, and possess conditions favorable
to the production of Balmer lines that are broadened by electron scattering.
Their huge electron column densities suppress any X-rays. Late-stage
quasi-stars, with black hole masses $\gtrsim 10^6 M_\odot$, should dominate the
overall quasi-star population. Their short predicted lifetimes (tens of Myr),
coupled with the high observed comoving density of LRDs, suggest that most or
all supermassive black holes go through a quasi-star/LRD phase during their
formation and growth.

*Sudheesh T. P.,Ruta Kale,Jithesh V.,Ishwara-Chandra C. H.,Joe Jacob*

**TL;DR**: 发现候选双双重射电星系J2349-0003具有内外两对射电瓣和核心，证实其经历两次AGN活动间歇期，可能受环境与并合过程影响演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究双峰射电星系J2349-0003的射电形态和活动星系核（AGN）活动历史，探讨其演化过程中环境相互作用和并合事件的影响。

Data: 数据来源于高分辨率uGMRT在Bands 3、4和5的观测结果。

Method: 采用高分辨率uGMRT多频段观测分析复杂射电形态及光谱特性。

Result: 发现J2349-0003可能是一个三重双射电星系候选体，具有两次AGN活动间歇期，且合并驱动过程可能影响了其演化。

Abstract: We present a multi-frequency analysis of the candidate double-double radio
galaxy (DDRG) J2349-0003, exhibiting a possible lobe misalignment.
High-resolution uGMRT observations at Bands 3 and 4 reveal a complex radio
morphology featuring a pair of inner and outer lobes, and the radio core, while
the Band 5 image detects the core and the compact components. The positioning
of both pairs of lobes with the central core supports its classification as a
DDRG. Spectral age estimates for the inner and outer lobes indicate two
distinct episodes of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity interspaced by a
short quiescent phase. The possible compact steep spectrum nature of the core,
together with its concave spectral curvature, suggests ongoing or recent jet
activity, suggesting the possibility that J2349-0003 may be a candidate
triple-double radio galaxy. With a projected linear size of 1.08 Mpc,
J2349-0003 is classified as a giant radio galaxy (GRG), although its moderate
radio power (~10^24 W/Hz) suggests a sparse surrounding environment. Arm-length
(R_theta) and flux density ratios (R_S) indicates environmental influences on
source symmetry. The observed lobe misalignment and the presence of nearby
galaxies in the optical image suggest that merger-driven processes may have
played a key role in shaping the source's evolution.

Result: 发现贫金属星主要由晕族、盘族和盖亚香肠结构组成，其中盘族恒星比例随轨道高度降低而增加，表明其可能源自原始盘而非并合加热。

Abstract: The origin of very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H] $\leq -2.0$) stars on planar
orbits has been the subject of great attention since their first discovery.
However, prior to the release of the Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra, and large
photometric samples such as SkyMapper, SAGES, J-PLUS and S-PLUS, most studies
have been limited due to their small sample sizes or strong selection effects.
Here, we cross-match photometric metallicities derived from Gaia XP synthetic
photometry and geometric distances from Bailer-Jones et al., and select 12,000
VMP stars (1604 dwarfs and 10,396 giants) with available high-quality
astrometry. After calculating dynamical parameter estimates using
\texttt{AGAMA}, we employ the non-negative matrix factorization technique to
the $v_\phi$ distribution across bins in $Z_{\rm max}$ (the maximum height
above or below the Galactic plane during the stellar orbit). We find three
primary populations of the selected VMP stars: halo, disk system, and the Gaia
Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) structure. The fraction of disk-like stars decreases
with increasing $Z_{\rm max}$ (as expected), although it is still $\sim 20$\%
for stars with $Z_{\rm max}$ $\sim 3 $ kpc. Similar results emerge from the
application of the Hayden criterion, which separates stellar populations on the
basis of their orbital inclination angles relative to the Galactic plane. We
argue that such high fractions of disk-like stars indicate that they are an
independent component, rather than originating solely from Galactic building
blocks or heating by minor mergers. We suggest that most of these VMP stars are
members of the hypothesized ``primordial" disk.

### [9] [Eccentric Accretion Disks in Active Galactic Nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09578)

**TL;DR**: 提出偏心吸积盘模型统一解释活动星系核的宽线区和X射线冕，阐明其多波段辐射和快速光变机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究聚焦于通过偏心吸积盘模型统一解释活动星系核（AGN）中宽线区（BLR）和X射线冕的多波段辐射与快速光变现象。

Data: 数据来源于对超大质量黑洞周围中等偏心流体的模拟研究，结合了环核气体吸积或潮汐瓦解事件的理论模型。

Result: 中等偏心的吸积盘模型统一了活动星系核的宽线区和X射线冕，解释了多波段辐射和快速光变现象。

Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs), among the universe's most luminous objects,
radiate across the entire electromagnetic spectrum. They are powered by
gravitational energy released from material feeding central supermassive black
holes (SMBHs). However, current AGN theory remains largely phenomenological,
relying on envisioned structures beyond accretion disks to produce broad
optical emission lines (broad line regions, BLRs) and X-ray emission (corona).
It struggles to explain accretion disk sizes, optical line diversity, BLR
radial inflows/outflows, and crucially, rapid X-ray and optical variability
(line width, line shape, inflow/outflow switch, emitting region) on timescales
significantly shorter than disk accretion. Here we show that moderately
eccentric flows around SMBHs-formed via circumnuclear gas accretion or tidal
disruption events-generate eccentricity cascades in the BLRs (from 0.8 to 0.2
outwards), explaining multi-wavelength emission and variability. The flows'
non-axisymmetric temperature structures explain dust sublimation asymmetries,
different BLR components and their radial motions. The innermost BLR links to
the SMBH vicinity through highly eccentric streams producing soft X-rays at
periapsis. General relativistic precession further compresses these flows,
generating a hard X-ray continuum near the SMBHs. Precession of the eccentric
flow drives optical/X-ray variability, reproducing the observed X-ray power
spectral density and occasional X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions. We thus propose
eccentric accretion disks as a physical AGN model unifying the elusive BLRs and
X-ray corona. This model enables detailed anatomy of AGNs and maximises their
potential as cosmological standard candles.

Result: 黑洞在恒星核心各向异性时通过动力学牵引机制转移角动量，可能导致其从星系中心向外迁移或延迟数百万年沉降。

Abstract: We investigate the circumstances which allow a black hole to remain put at
the galactic centre when the stellar core is anisotropic. We use N-body
calculations to study the response of stellar orbit families embedded in a
larger, isotropic isochrone (H\'enon) background potential. When the BH orbits
in an odd f[E,Lz] velocity distribution function, they transfer angular
momentum to it. We call this dynamical traction: it takes place whenever the
kinetic energy drawn from f[E,Lz] has an excess of streaming motion over its
(isotropic) v-dispersion. For a dynamically cold disc, the outcome depends on
both the orbit of the BH and that of a Jeans-unstable stellar sub-structures.
When the stellar clumps have much binding energy, a BH may scatter off of them
after they formed. In the process the BH may be dislodged from the centre and
migrate outward due to dynamical traction. When the stellar clumps are less
bound, they may still migrate to the centre where they either dissolve or merge
with the BH. The final configuration is similar to a nuclear star cluster which
may yet be moving at ~10 km/s wrt the barycentre.
  The angular momentum transferred to a BH by dynamical traction delays the
migration to the galactic centre by several hundred million years. The
efficiency of angular momentum transfer is a strong function of the fragmented
(cold) state of the stellar space density. In a dynamically cold environment, a
BH is removed from the central region through a two-stage orbital migration
instability. A criterion against this instability is proposed in the form of a
threshold in isotropic velocity dispersion compared to streaming motion. For a
BH to settle at the heart of a galaxy on time-scales of ~ 300 Myr or less
requires that a large fraction of Lz be dissipated, or, alternatively, that the
BH grows in situ in an isotropic environment devoid of sub-structures.

Abstract: The outer Galaxy presents a distinctive environment for investigating star
formation. This study develops a novel approach to identify true cluster
members based on unsupervised clustering using astrometry with significant
uncertainties. As a proof of concept, we analyze three outer Galactic Young
Stellar Object (YSO) clusters at different distances and densities within 65 <
l < 265 degrees, each known to contain >100 members based on the Star Formation
in Outer Galaxy catalog. The 618 YSO clusters in the SFOG dataset were based on
2-dimensional clustering. In this contribution, we apply the HDBSCAN* algorithm
to the precise Gaia DR3 astrometry to assign YSO cluster membership. Monte
Carlo simulation, coupled with HDBSCAN* (HDBSCAN-MC algorithm), addresses YSO
astrometric uncertainties while 5-dimensional clustering. We introduce the
Generation Of cLuster anD FIeld STar (GOLDFIST) simulation, to enable robust
membership determination, performing an unsupervised clustering analysis in
higher-dimensional feature space while accommodating measurement errors. In
this study, we extended our approach to distant outer galaxy YSOs and clusters
with larger astrometric uncertainties. The results include the discovery of new
members in the previously identified clusters. We also analyze the known stars
in the clusters and confirm their membership. The derived membership
probabilities are included in the provided cluster catalogs. The more
accurately predicted simulation distance estimates closely agree, within
uncertainty limits, with the median distance estimates derived from Gaia data,
and are compared with the kinematic distances from the WISE HII survey.

Galactic halo using highly accurate atmospheric parameters Giribaldi et al.
(2021, 2023) and cutting-edge 3D NLTE models Amarsi et al (2018). Most [Mg/Fe]
versus [Fe/H] diagrams in the literature exhibit significant scatter at [Fe/H]
$\lesssim -2$ dex, often interpreted as evidence of inhomogeneous enrichment
during the early phases of galaxy evolution Rossi et al. (2021). However, our
analysis of observational data reveals that in the range $-3.5 <$ [Fe/H] $< -2$
dex, the [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] distribution is relatively narrow. This finding
suggests a low degree of stochastic enrichment in magnesium during these epochs
in the Milky Way halo.

Abstract: Nuclear rings are long-lived structures, allowing the molecular gas inside to
become sufficiently dense to initiate star formation. This makes them a crucial
element in the study of secular evolution. However, the morphology of nuclear
rings, and their potential correlations with that of the galactic hosts,
remains an open subject. We examine 52 star-forming nuclear rings from the
Atlas of Images of NUclear Rings (AINUR) and correlate the overall galaxy
morphology, in particular non-axisymmetric features, with the morphology of the
nuclear ring. We define three different classes of nuclear rings: two-armed
rings dominated by two dust lanes, twoarms+ rings crowded with secondary dust
lanes in addition to the two main ones, and many-armed rings with multiple
armlets of similar prevalence. We employ unsharp-masked Hubble Space Telescope
images to study the structure of nuclear rings. We find that two-armed rings
are more common in early-type grand design galaxies with strong bars. Twoarms+
rings are related to later-type and more weakly barred galaxies, both grand
design and multi-armed. Lastly, many-armed rings are typically associated with
later-type flocculent and multi-armed galaxies with the weakest bars. In
addition, we examine the regions inside the nuclear rings and observe nuclear
spirals in 28 galaxies ( 90 % of those galaxies for which the interior of the
nuclear ring is resolved). We conclude that the global morphology of the host
galaxy and, more precisely, the presence and properties of a bar play a
fundamental role in determining the morphology of the nuclear ring and the
nuclear region. We suggest that two-armed rings are associated with a 180deg
structure forced by a strong bar, many-armed rings are associated with a very
weak or absent 180deg structure, and twoarms+ rings are found in intermediate
cases.

Abstract: Context. The evolution of massive star-forming clumps that are progenitors of
high-mass young stellar objects are often classified based on a variety of
observational indicators ranging from near-IR to radio wavelengths. Among them,
the ratio between the bolometric luminosity and the mass of their envelope,
$L/M$, has been observationally diagnosed as a good indicator for the
evolutionary classification of parsec-scale star-forming clumps in the Galaxy.
  Aims. We have developed the Rosetta Stone project$\unicode{x2013}$an
end-to-end framework designed to enable an accurate comparison between
simulations and observations for investigating the formation and evolution of
massive clumps. In this study, we calibrate the $L/M$ indicator in relation to
the star formation efficiency (SFE) and the clump age, as derived from our
suite of simulations.
  Methods. We perform multi-wavelength radiative transfer post-processing of
RMHD simulations of the collapse of star-forming clumps fragmenting into
protostars. We generate synthetic observations to obtain far-infrared emission
from $70$ to $500\ \mu$m, as was done in the Hi-GAL survey and at $24\ \mu$m in
the MIPSGAL survey, which are then used to build the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) and estimate the $L/M$ parameter. An additional $1.3$ mm
wavelength in ALMA Band 6 has also been produced for the comparison with
observational data. We have applied observational techniques, commonly employed
by observers, to the synthetic data, in order to derive the corresponding
physical parameters.
  Results. We find a correlation between $L/M$ and the SFE, with a power-law
form $L/M\propto {\rm SFE}^{1.20^{+0.02}_{-0.03}}$. This correlation is
independent of the mass of the clumps and the choice of initial conditions of
the simulations in which they formed. (Abridged)

Abstract: Massive protoclusters at z~1.5-4, the peak of the cosmic star formation
history, are key to understanding the formation mechanisms of massive galaxies
in today's clusters. However, studies of protoclusters at these high redshifts
remain limited, primarily due to small sample sizes and heterogeneous selection
criteria. In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation of the star
formation and cold gas properties of member galaxies of eight massive
protoclusters in the COSMOS field, using the statistical and homogeneously
selected sample from the Noema formIng Cluster survEy (NICE). Our analysis
reveals a steep increase in the star formation rates per halo mass
($\Sigma_{\rm SFR} /M_{\rm halo}$) with redshifts in these intensively
star-forming protoclusters, reaching values one to two orders of magnitude
higher than those observed in the field at z>2. We further show that, instead
of an enhancement of starbursts, this increase is largely driven by the
concentration of massive and gas-rich star-forming galaxies in the protocluster
cores. The member galaxies still generally follow the same star formation main
sequence as in the field, with a moderate enhancement at the low mass end.
Notably, the most massive protocluster galaxies ($M_{\rm
halo}$>8$\times$10$^{10}$M$_\odot$) exhibit higher $f_{\rm gas}$ and $\tau_{\rm
gas}$ than their field counterparts, while remaining on the star forming main
sequence. These gas-rich, massive, and star-forming galaxies are predominantly
concentrated in the protocluster cores and are likely progenitors of massive
ellipticals in the center of today's clusters. These results suggest that the
formation of massive galaxies in such environments is sustained by substantial
gas reservoirs, which support persistent star formation and drive early mass
assembly in forming cluster cores.

Abstract: The role of magnetic fields in the formation of dense filamentary structures
in molecular clouds is critical for understanding the star formation process.
The Snake filament in or close to the Pipe Nebula s neighboring, a prominent
example of such structures, offers an ideal environment to study the interplay
between magnetic fields and gas dynamics in the early stages of star formation.
This study aims to investigate how magnetic fields influence the structure and
dynamics of the Snake filament, using both polarization data and molecular line
observations. Our goal is to understand the role of magnetic fields in shaping
the filamentary structure and explore the kinematics within the filament. We
conducted polarization observations in the optical and near-infrared bands
using the 1.6 m and 60 cm telescopes at the Observatorio do Pico dos
Dias/Laboratorio Nacional de Astrof\isica (OPD/LNA). Molecular line
observations of the C18O and 13CO lines were obtained using the IRAM 30m
telescope. We analyzed the data to characterize polarization and gas properties
within the filament, with a focus on understanding the magnetic field
orientation and its relationship with the filament s structure. Our findings
reveal that the polarization vectors align with the filament s spine,
indicating a magnetic field structure that is predominantly parallel to the
filament at lower-density regions. A velocity gradient along the filament is
observed in both C18O and 13CO lines, with C18O tracing the denser regions of
the gas. The polarization efficiency decreases with increasing visual
extinction, consistent with reduced grain alignment in higher-density regions.
The filament s mass-to-length ratio is below the critical value required for
gravitational collapse, indicating stability.

Result: 径向气体流入使NGC300的HI气体质量面密度、恒星形成率面密度和金属丰度的径向分布变陡，但使特定恒星形成率的径向分布变平。

Abstract: In the build-up of galactic discs gas infall is an important ingredient and
it produces radial gas inflows as a physical consequence of angular momentum
conservation, since the infalling gas on to the disc at a specific radius has
lower angular momentum than the circular motions of the gas at the point of
impact. NGC300 is a well studied isolated, bulge-less, and low-mass disc galaxy
ideally suited for an investigation of galaxy evolution with radial gas
inflows. To investigate the effects of radial gas inflows on the physical
properties of NGC300, a chemical evolution model for NGC300 is constructed by
assuming its disc builds up progressively by infalling of metall-free gas and
outflowing of metal-enriched gas. Radial gas inflows are also considered in the
model. Our model including the radial gas inflows and an inside-out disc
formation scenario can simultaneously reproduce the present-day observed radial
profiles of HI gas mass surface density, SFR surface density, sSFR, gas-phase
and stellar metallicity. We find that, although the value of radial gas inflow
velocity is as low as -0.1 km/s, the radial gas inflows steepen the present-day
radial profiles of HI gas mass surface density, SFR surface density, and
metallicity, but flatten the radial sSFR profile. Incorporating radial gas
inflows significantly improves the agreement between our model predicted
present-day sSFR profile and the observations of NGC300. It predicts a
significant flattening of the metallicity gradient with cosmic time. We also
find that the model predicted star formation has been more active recently,
indicating that the radial gas inflows may be help to sustain star formation in
local spirals, at least in NGC300.

Result: 发现银河系垂直动力学处于非平衡状态，速度弥散张量的三个对角分量均呈现不对称特征，并揭示出与Gaia相螺旋相关的相关结构。

Abstract: We present a novel non-parametric method for inferring smooth models of the
mean velocity field and velocity dispersion tensor of the Milky Way from
astrometric data. Our approach is based on Stochastic Variational Gaussian
Process Regression (SVGPR) and provides an attractive alternative to binning
procedures. SVGPR is an approximation to standard GPR, the latter of which
suffers severe computational scaling with N and assumes independently
distributed Gaussian Noise. In the Galaxy however, velocity measurements
exhibit scatter from both observational uncertainty and the intrinsic velocity
dispersion of the distribution function. We exploit the factorization property
of the objective function in SVGPR to simultaneously model both the mean
velocity field and velocity dispersion tensor as separate Gaussian Processes.
This achieves a computational complexity of O(M^3) versus GPR's O(N^3), where M
<< N is a subset of points chosen in a principled way to summarize the data.
Applied to a sample of ~8 x 10^5 stars from the Gaia DR3 Radial Velocity
Survey, we construct differentiable profiles of the mean velocity and velocity
dispersion as functions of height above the Galactic midplane. We find
asymmetric features in all three diagonal components of the velocity dispersion
tensor, providing evidence that the vertical dynamics of the Milky Way are in a
state of disequilibrium. Furthermore, our dispersion profiles exhibit
correlated structures at several locations in |z|, which we interpret as
signatures of the Gaia phase spiral. These results demonstrate that our method
provides a promising direction for data-driven analyses of Galactic dynamics.

Abstract: Isotopic ratios have been used as chemical diagnostics to investigate the
origin of the material in the Solar System. We have determined the HCN, HNC,
and N2H+ isotopic ratios and the chemical age in a large sample of 23 starless
cores located in different environments. This work uses IRAM 30m data to
constrain the D/H ratio of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ as well as the 14N/15N ratio of
HCN and HNC. The observed abundances have been modeled using the chemical code
DNAUTILUS 2.0. Deuterated compounds are detected in all of our sample cores,
with average DNC/HNC, DCN/HCN, and N2D+/N2H+ values of 0.054$\pm$0.019,
0.036$\pm$0.033, and 0.15$\pm$0.11, respectively. The deuterium fractions
(Dfrac) show a weak correlation with temperature and a large scatter that
reflects that other factors such as core evolution could also play a
significant role. Our chemical model is able to reproduce all the observed
values with 0.2-0.3 Myr in Taurus and 0.3-0.5 Myr in Perseus and Orion. The
14N/15N isotopic ratio is found to be different between HCN/HC15N (430$\pm$120)
and HNC/H15NC (296$\pm$64). We find no correlation between these ratios and the
deuterium fractions, but we report a weak correlation with temperature. The
Dfrac of HCN, HNC, and N2H+ can be used as evolutionary tracers of starless
cores as long as the physical parameters are well constrained. The HCN/HC15N
and HNC/H15NC ratios are not correlated with Dfrac, suggesting that the
detected variations are not correlated with the core evolutionary stage. The
average value of the HCN/HC15N ratio in our sample is significantly higher than
the values measured in protostars and protoplanetary disks, possibly indicating
that nitrogen fractionation processes are taking place during the protostellar
phase.

Abstract: We present new Chandra X-ray imaging spectroscopy of the compact galaxy group
IC 2431, and compare with archival ultraviolet, optical, infrared, and radio
images. IC 2431 is a starburst system containing three tidally-distorted disk
galaxies. All three galaxies may have active nuclei. One galaxy is classified
as an AGN based on its optical spectrum, a second is identified as a possible
X-ray AGN based on the Chandra data, and the third galaxy may host a radio AGN.
In optical images, a prominent dust lane crosses the southern galaxy, while
Spitzer infrared images show a dusty bridge connecting the two brightest
galaxies. Chandra maps reveal a massive (2 x 10^7 M(sun)) concentration of hot
gas between these two galaxies, as well as several other knots of hot gas and
non-thermal emission. The unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of the hot gas in IC 2431
is ~ 1 x 10^42 erg/s, which is enhanced by about a factor of four relative to
the star formation rate, compared to other star-forming galaxies. In radio
maps, a bright jet/ridge of radio continuum emission extends 4 kpc from one
nucleus. We compare the properties of IC 2431 with those of other interacting
galaxy systems, and discuss two different scenarios that may account for the
peculiarities of IC 2431: ram pressure stripping of the interstellar medium
during a head-on collision between two galaxies, or an AGN-powered radio jet
that has been distorted by an interaction with interstellar gas during a tidal
encounter between galaxies.

Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec PRISM observations of three luminous ($M_{\rm
UV}<-20$) galaxies at $z\sim10$ observed with the CAPERS Cycle 3 program. These
galaxies exhibit extreme UV slopes compared to typical galaxies at $z=10$. Of
the three sources, two of them are a close pair (0.22 - arcsec) of blue
galaxies at $z=9.800\pm0.003$ and $z=9.808\pm0.002$ with UV slopes of
$\beta=-2.87\pm0.15$ and $\beta=-2.46\pm0.10$ respectively, selected from
PRIMER COSMOS NIRCam imaging. We perform spectrophotometric modeling of the
galaxies which suggests extremely young stellar ages and a lack of dust
attenuation. For the bluest galaxy, its UV slope also suggests significant
Lyman continuum escape. In contrast, the third source (selected from CEERS
NIRCam imaging) at $z=9.942\pm0.002$ exhibits a red UV slope with
$\beta=-1.51\pm0.08$. We rule out the possibility of a strong nebular continuum
due to the lack of a Balmer jump and find no evidence to support the presence
of active galactic nucleus continuum due to a lack of strong UV emission lines
and no broad component to H$\gamma$ or H$\beta$. Instead, it is most likely
that the red UV slope is due to dust-reddening ($A_{\rm V}\simeq0.9$) implying
a significant level of dust-obscured star-formation only $\simeq480\, \rm Myr$
after the Big Bang. Under standard assumptions for dust attenuation, EGS-25297
would be the most intrinsically UV-luminous galaxy ($M_{\mathrm{UV,corr}}\simeq
-22.4^{+0.7}_{-1.1}$) yet spectroscopically confirmed at $z \sim 10$. This work
highlights that luminous galaxies at $z\gtrsim10$ have a diversity of dust
properties and that spectroscopy of these galaxies is essential to fully
understand star-formation at $z\gtrsim10$.

Abstract: Through studying rotation curves, which depict how the velocity of the stars
and gas changes with distance from the center of the galaxy, it has been
confirmed that dark matter dominates galaxy's outer regions, as their rotation
curve remains flat. However, recent studies of star-forming galaxies at cosmic
noon have shown a decline in their rotation curve beyond a certain point,
suggesting a decrease of the abundance of dark matter in galactic halos during
earlier times. In this work, we investigate the influence of cosmological
surface brightness dimming and loss of resolution on observations of rotation
curves at cosmic noon. We used a sample of 19 Lyman Break Analogs at $z \approx
0.2$ and artificially redshifted them as if they were at $z \approx 2.2$. By
comparing both rotation curves of the observed and mocked objects, we find that
the asymmetry of the cosmic noon galaxies is smaller than that of the low-$z$
galaxies. In low-$z$ galaxies, asymmetry increases with radius and becomes
relevant at the external parts, where mergers and interactions cause more
disturbance in the galaxy's gravitational field. In contrast, cosmic-noon
galaxies appear smoother, smaller, and suitable for dynamical modeling -- when
in reality, they are not. The combined effects of the cosmological bias and
loss of resolution lead us to the conclusion that caution should be exercised

**TL;DR**: 通过研究M101星系中的HI空洞和恒星反馈，量化了恒星反馈在原子气体盘中形成空洞并排出中性气体的效率，揭示了其对恒星形成的长期影响。

Method: 使用高分辨率THINGS、GALEX和SITELLE/SIGNALS IFU数据对M101星系中的HI空洞进行多波段观测分析。

Abstract: Spiral galaxy disks are thought to exist in a quasi-stationary state, between
fresh gas accretion from cosmic filaments and disk star formation,
self-regulated through supernovae feedback. Our goal here is to quantify these
processes and probe their efficiency. While star formation can be traced at 10
Myr time-scales through H$\alpha$ emission, the signature of OB stars, and at
100 Myr scale with UV emission, the gas surface density is traced by HI
emission for the atomic phase. We choose to investigate feedback processes
using fountain effects in M101, a nearby well-observed face-on galaxy. Face-on
studies are very complementary to the more frequent edge-on observations of
these fountains in the literature. We use high-resolution data from THINGS for
the HI emission GALEX for UV, and SITELLE/SIGNALS IFU for the H$\alpha$ tracer.
We have identified 20 new HI holes, in addition to the 52 holes found by
Kamphuis in 1993. We study in more detail the nine holes satisfying strong
criteria to be true fountain effects, compute their physical properties, and
derive their energy balance. Only one small HI hole still contains H$\alpha$
and young stars inside, while the largest hole of 2.4 kpc and oldest age (94
Myr) is deprived of H$\alpha$ and UV. For face-on disks, the possibility to
study simultaneously the HI shell morphology, the stellar association, and
kinematic evidence is of primordial importance. In M101, we have quantified how
stellar feedback is responsible for carving the observed cavities in the atomic
gas disk, and how it can expel above the disk the neutral gas, which is then
unavailable for star formation during up to 100 Myr.

Result: 在球形势场中，角动量向量近乎平行的天体可形成稳定的角动量空间束缚对，其临界分离取决于扰动体质量、轨道倾角和径向距离。

Abstract: Consider a system of point masses in a spherical potential. In such systems
objects execute planar orbits covering two-dimensional rings or annuli,
represented by the angular-momentum vectors, which slowly reorient due to the
persistent weak gravitational interaction between different rings. This
process, called vector resonant relaxation, is much faster than other processes
which change the size/shape of the rings. The interaction is stron9gest between
objects with closely aligned angular-momentum vectors. In this paper, we show
that nearly parallel angular-momentum vectors may form stable bound pairs in
angular-momentum space. We examine the stability of such pairs against an
external massive perturber, and determine the critical separation analogous to
the Hill radius or tidal radius in the three-body problem, where the
angular-momentum pairs are marginally disrupted, as a function of the
perturber's mass, the orbital inclination, and the radial distance.
Angular-momentum pairs or multiples closer than the critical inclination will
remain bound and evolve together in angular-momentum-direction space under any
external influence, such as anisotropic density fluctuations, or massive
perturbers. This study has applications in various astrophysical contexts,
including galactic nuclei, in particular the Milky Way's Galactic centre,
globular clusters, or planetary systems. In nuclear star clusters with a
central super-massive black hole, we apply this criterion to the disc of young,
massive stars, and show that clusters in angular-momentum space may be used to
constrain the presence of intermediate-mass black holes or the mass of the
nearby gaseous torus.

**TL;DR**: 研究发现宇宙微波背景、Ia型超新星和星系巡天的偶极子应指向一致但幅度可不同，澄清了标准宇宙学模型中的常见误解。

Background: 研究探讨了宇宙微波背景、Ia型超新星和星系巡天观测中宇宙偶极子的不一致性对标准宇宙学模型的潜在挑战。

Data: 数据来源包括宇宙微波背景辐射（CMB）观测、Ia型超新星的光度距离测量以及星系和类星体的空间分布调查。

Method: 采用标准ΛCDM模型分析宇宙微波背景、超新星和星系巡天数据的偶极贡献。

Result: 宇宙微波背景、Ia型超新星和星系巡天的宇宙偶极子应当对齐但幅度可以不同。

Abstract: Large-scale structure surveys can be used to measure the dipole in the cosmic
microwave background (CMB), in the luminosity distances inferred from type-Ia
supernova observations, and in the spatial distribution of galaxies and
quasars. The measurements of these cosmic dipoles appear to be mutually
inconsistent, even though they are expected to indicate the common observer
velocity. This observational tension may represent a significant challenge to
the standard model of cosmology. Here we study in detail what contributes to
the cosmic dipoles from CMB, supernova, and galaxy survey in the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model, though our theoretical model can be applied beyond the
standard model. While measurements of the cosmic dipoles yield the relative
velocities between the source samples and the observer velocity, the motion of
the observer is the dominant contribution in the conformal Newtonian gauge, and
the intrinsic velocities of the samples fall steeply with increasing redshift
of the sources. Hence the cosmic dipoles of CMB, type-Ia supernovae, and
galaxies should be aligned but can have different amplitudes. We also clarify
several misconceptions that are commonly found in the literature.

Abstract: Massive galaxy clusters act as prominent strong-lenses. Due to a combination
of observational biases, cluster evolution and lensing efficiency, most of the
known cluster lenses lie typically at $z_{l}\sim0.2-0.7$, with only a few
prominent examples at higher redshifts. Here we report a first strong-lensing
analysis of the massive galaxy cluster SPT-CL J0546-5345 at a redshift
$z_l=1.07$. This cluster was first detected through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
effect, with a high estimated mass for its redshift of $M_{200,c} = (7.95 \pm
0.92) \times 10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$. Using recent JWST/NIRCam and archival HST
imaging, we identify at least 10 secure and 6 candidate sets of multiply imaged
background galaxies, which we use to constrain the mass distribution in the
cluster. We derive effective Einstein radii of $\theta_{E}= 18.1 \pm 1.8 ''$
for a source at $z_{s}=3$, and $\theta_{E}= 27.9 \pm 2.8 ''$ for a source at
$z_{s}=9$. The total projected mass within a $200$ kpc radius around the
strong-lensing region is $M(<200\,\mathrm{kpc}) = (1.9 \pm 0.3) \times
10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$. While our results rely on photometric redshifts warranting
spectroscopic follow-up, this central mass resembles that of the Hubble
Frontier Fields clusters - although SPT-CL J0546-5345 is observed when the
Universe was $\sim 3-4$ Gyr younger. Amongst the multiply-imaged sources, we
identify a hyperbolic-umbilic-like configuration, and, thanks to its point-like
morphology, a possible Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). If confirmed
spectroscopically, it will add to just a handful of other quasars and AGN known
to be multiply lensed by galaxy clusters.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters enables faint distant
galaxies to be more abundantly detected than in blank fields, thereby allowing
one to construct galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) to an unprecedented depth at
high redshifts. Intriguingly, photometric redshift catalogs (e.g. Shipley et
al. (2018)) constructed from the Hubble Frontier Fields survey display an
excess of z$\gtrsim$4 galaxies in the cluster lensing fields and are not seen
in accompanying blank parallel fields. The observed excess, while maybe a gift
of gravitational lensing, could also be from misidentified low-z contaminants
having similar spectral energy distributions as high-z galaxies. In the latter
case, the contaminants may result in nonphysical turn-ups in UV LFs and/or wash
out faint end turnovers predicted by contender cosmological models to
$\Lambda$CDM. Here, we employ the concept of magnification bias to perform the
first statistical estimation of contamination levels in HFF lensing field
photometric redshift catalogs. To our great worry, while we were able to
reproduce a lower-z lensed sample, it was found $\sim56\%$ of $3.5 < z_{phot} <
5.5$ samples are likely low-z contaminants! Widely adopted Lyman Break
Galaxy-like selection rules in literature may give a 'cleaner' sample
magnification bias-wise but we warn readers the resulting sample would also be
less complete. Individual mitigation of the contaminants is arguably the best
way for the investigation of faint high-z Universe, and this may be made
possible with JWST observations.

Result: 发现扭转凝聚理论（TorC）允许更大的哈勃常数，可能缓解哈勃张力，但贝叶斯模型比较尚不足以支持其优于ΛCDM模型。

Abstract: Constraints on the cosmological parameters of Torsion Condensation (TorC) are
investigated using Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background data. TorC is a case
of Poincar\'e gauge theory -- a formulation of gravity motivated by the gauge
field theories underlying fundamental forces in the standard model of particle
physics. Unlike general relativity, TorC incorporates intrinsic torsion degrees
of freedom while maintaining second-order field equations. At specific
parameter values, it reduces to the $\Lambda$CDM model, providing a natural
extension to standard cosmology. The base model of TorC introduces two
parameters beyond those in $\Lambda$CDM: the initial value of the torsion
scalar field and its time derivative -- one can absorb the latter by allowing
the dark energy density to float. To constrain these parameters, `PolyChord`
nested sampling algorithm is employed, interfaced via `Cobaya` with a modified
version of `CAMB`. Our results indicate that TorC allows for a larger inferred
Hubble constant, offering a potential resolution to the Hubble tension. Tension
analysis using the $R$-statistic shows that TorC alleviates the statistical
tension between the Planck 2018 and SH0Es 2020 datasets, though this
improvement is not sufficient to decisively favour TorC over $\Lambda$CDM in a
Bayesian model comparison. This study highlights TorC as a compelling theory of
gravity, demonstrating its potential to address cosmological tensions and
motivating further investigations of extended theories of gravity within a
cosmological context. As current and upcoming surveys -- including Euclid,
Roman Space Telescope, Vera C. Rubin Observatory, LISA, and Simons Observatory
-- deliver data on gravity across all scales, they will offer critical tests of
gravity models like TorC, making the present a pivotal moment for exploring
extended theories of gravity.

Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing (WL) peak statistics capture cosmic non-linear
structures and can provide additional cosmological information complementary to
cosmic shear two-point correlation analyses. They have been applied to
different WL surveys successfully. To further facilitate their high precision
applications, it is very timely to investigate the impacts of different
systematics on WL peak statistics and how to mitigate them. Concerning the
influence from galaxy intrinsic alignments (IAs), in this paper, we develop a
theoretical model for WL high peaks taking into account the IA effects. It is
an extension of our previous halo-based model. The IA corrections mainly
include the modification of the lensing profile of clusters of galaxies due to
the alignments of satellite galaxies and the additional shape noise
correlations. We validate our model using simulations with the semi-analytical
galaxy formation. We consider the cases where the satellite galaxies are
averagely radially aligned toward the centers of their host clusters but with
different dispersions $\sigma_{\theta}$. We show that our model works well for
$\sigma_{\theta}>45^{\circ}$. If the IA corrections are not included in the
model, for the Euclid/CSST-like source galaxy distribution and the survey area
of $\sim 1000 deg^2$, the IA induced bias on $S_8$ can reach $\sim 8\sigma$
even for $\sigma_{\theta}=75^{\circ}$. With our model, not only the bias can be
well mitigated, but also we can constrain the satellite IA to the level of {\bf
$\sigma(\sigma_{\theta})\sim \pm 24^{\circ}$} simultaneously from WL high peak
analyses alone using data from such a survey.

Abstract: The cosmological principle is a cornerstone of the standard cosmological
model. However, recent observations suggest potential deviations from this
assumption, hinting at a small anisotropic expansion. Such an expansion can
arise from sources that break rotational invariance. A minimal realization of
this scenario is described by a Bianchi I geometry, where each spatial
direction evolves at a different rate, and the degree of anisotropy is
quantified by the shear parameter $\Sigma$. In this work, we constrain the
present-day value of the shear, $\Sigma_0$, by confronting theoretical
predictions with recent cosmological data. We implement various anisotropic
models within the Boltzmann code \texttt{CLASS} and explore their parameter
space using the sampler \texttt{MontePython}. Although our results show that
$\Sigma_0$ is model-dependent, notably, in one specific scenario considering a
homogeneous scalar field coupled to a 2-form field, $\Sigma_0 = 0$ is excluded
at the $2\sigma$ confidence level, with mean value around $|\Sigma_0| \sim
10^{-4}$ while remaining consistent with observations. These findings challenge
the conventional assumption that cosmic shear is negligible in the present
universe. Moreover, the anisotropic expansion in this model is driven by a
steep scalar field potential, a feature often found in supergravity-inspired
scenarios. While anisotropic models offer interesting alternatives and could
help explain some cosmological anomalies, they generally introduce additional
parameters, making the standard $\Lambda$CDM model statistically favored in
most cases. Still, they remain compatible with current observations and provide
new perspectives on features not fully explained within the standard framework.
These results highlight the importance of further exploring anisotropic
cosmologies to better understand their implications.

Abstract: Gravitational wave astronomy presents a promising opportunity to directly
observe scalar-induced gravitational waves originating from the early universe.
Future experiments, including ground-based interferometers like LIGO and Virgo,
the Pulsar Timing Array, and telescopes such as FAST and SKA, are poised to
significantly enhance sensitivity to these gravitational waves. In this paper,
we combined Cosmic Microwave Background data with upper or lower limits of the
stochastic gravitational wave background provided by FAST or SKA, to constrain
scalar-induced gravitational waves. To provide a comprehensive forecast, we
consider two scenarios: one where FAST or SKA does not detect scalar-induced
gravitational waves, thereby setting an upper limit on the fractional energy
density; and another where these waves are detected successfully, thus
establishing a lower limit on the fractional energy density. In the
$\Lambda$CDM+$r$ model, the scalar spectral index of the power-law power
spectrum is constrained to $n_s=0.9589^{+0.0021}_{-0.0011}$ from the
combinations of CMB+BAO+SKA datasets in the upper limit scenario. The
constraint shifts to $n_s = 0.9661^{+0.0027}_{-0.0039}$ in the lower limit
scenario. Comparing with the constraint from the combinations of CMB+BAO
datasets, the scalar spectral index $n_s$ exhibits significant changes, which
could serve as an indicator for detecting scalar-induced gravitational waves.
In the $\Lambda$CDM+$\alpha_s$+$r$ model and the
$\Lambda$CDM+$\alpha_s$+$\beta_s$+$r$ model, the running of the scalar spectral
index $\alpha_s$ and the running of the running of the scalar spectral index
$\beta_s$ also show notable variations, suggesting potential indicators. The
numerical findings clearly demonstrate the impact of the upper and lower limits
provided by FAST or SKA.

Abstract: Measuring the autocorrelation of galaxy shapes, the so-called
intrinsic-intrinsic (II) correlation is important for both cosmology and
understanding the formation of massive elliptical galaxies. However, such
measurements are significantly more challenging than the cross-correlation with
galaxy density (GI correlation) due to the much lower signal-to-noise ratio. In
this paper, we report the first observational evidence for large-scale
intrinsic alignments measured from the ellipticity autocorrelations, extending
out to $100\,h^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}$. From SDSS and SDSS-III BOSS, we analyze over
the redshift range $0.16\leq z\leq 0.70$ luminous red galaxies (LRG), LOWZ and
CMASS galaxy samples, the latter two of which are cross-matched with
high-quality DESI imaging data. By expanding one of the two II correlation
functions, II($-$), in terms of the associated Legendre polynomials, we
effectively isolate the line-of-sight projection effects and enhance the
signal. The resulting correlation for all three samples exhibits a clear
power-law form. We also show that combining the two II correlations, II($+$)
and II($-$), increases the detection significance by $\sim 10\%$, though they
appear equivalent mathematically under the linear alignment model. Importantly,
this measurement opens a new observational window for probing signals uniquely
encoded in shape autocorrelations, such as tensor perturbations from the
gravitational waves. This analysis establishes a practical framework for
probing such effects.

Abstract: Cosmological N-body simulations are among the primary tools for studying
structure formation in the Universe. Analyses of these simulations critically
depend on accurately identifying and tracking dark matter subhalos over time.
In recent years, several new algorithms have been developed to improve the
accuracy and consistency of subhalo tracking in cold dark matter simulations.
These algorithms should be revisited in the context of new physics beyond
gravity, which can modify the evolution and final properties of subhalo
populations. In this work, we apply the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder
Symfind to velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter simulations with
large cross section amplitudes to assess the performance of particle-tracking
methods beyond the CDM paradigm. We find that the core-particle-tracking
technique, which is key to the success of these algorithms in CDM, does not
always yield accurate results in SIDM. The interplay between dark matter
self-interactions and tidal stripping can cause the diffusion of core particles
to larger radii, leading particle-tracking-based algorithms to prematurely lose
track of SIDM subhalos. For massive core-expansion subhalos and core-collapse
subhalos that experience close or repeated pericentric passages, a significant
fraction of core particles can be lost, and particle-tracking-based finders
such as Symfind offer no clear advantage over traditional methods that rely on
identifying phase-space overdensities. On the other hand, for subhalos with
large pericentric distances or fewer, more distant passages, Symfind tends to
outperform. These differences depend sensitively on the cross section amplitude
and turnover velocity of the underlying SIDM model. We therefore recommend a
hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both techniques to produce
complete and robust catalogs of core-expansion and core-collapse SIDM subhalos.

Abstract: Lensing studies are typically carried out around high density regions, such
as groups and clusters, where the lensing signals are significant and
indicative of rich density structures. However, a more comprehensive test of
the cosmological model should also include the lensing effect in low density
regions. In this work, we incorporate the stacked weak lensing signals around
the low density positions, alongside galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-galaxy
two point correlation function to perform a joint cosmological analysis on
$\sigma_8$. The low density positions are constructed from the DR9 data release
of the DESI legacy imaging survey, using galaxies with r-band absolute
magnitude cut M$<$-21.5 and in the redshift range of 0.18$<$z$<$0.28. In doing
so, we simultaneously parameterize photometric redshift errors and halo mass
uncertainties while building mock catalogs from simulations using the method of
SubHalo Abundance Matching (SHAM). For the weak lensing measurements, we use
the shear estimators derived from the DECaLS DR8 imaging data, processed by the
Fourier\_Quad pipeline. The survey boundaries and masks are fully taken into
account. Our analysis achieves a total significance of $31.1\sigma$ detection
for lensing in the low density positions, which significantly improve the
$\sigma_8$ constraint compared to galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy-galaxy two
point correlation function by 14$\%$. For flat $\Lambda$CDM model, we constrain
$\sigma_8$ =$0.824^{+0.015}_{-0.015}$, which shows a good agreement with the
PLANCK result. Additionally, the halo mass uncertainty $\sigma_{\lg M}$ and
photometric redshift error $\sigma_z$ are constrained to be
$0.565^{+0.086}_{-0.070}$ and $0.004^{+0.004}_{-0.003}$ respectively, which are
somewhat different from our expectations due to the significant degeneracy of
the two parameters.

*Da-Chun Qiang,Jing-Yi Jia,Hao Wei*

**TL;DR**: 结合DESY5超新星样本、Planck CMB数据和DESI-DR2 BAO测量发现，低红移超新星系统误差、CMB数据选择和BAO数据集对暗能量模型约束影响显著，揭示了观测数据校准与验证对评估宇宙学标准模型偏差的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 探索宇宙学标准模型ΛCDM与观测数据间的潜在偏差及其来源。

Data: 数据来源包括DESY5 SNIa样本（特别是其低红移部分DES-lowz）、Planck CMB数据、Planck和ACT-DR6的透镜测量以及DESI-DR2 BAO测量。

Method: 采用$w_0w_a$CDM框架结合不同CMB数据集、BAO测量和DESY5 SNIa样本进行系统分析。

Result: DESY5 SNIa样本的低红移部分、Planck CMB数据、Planck和ACT-DR6的透镜测量以及DESI-DR2 BAO测量对观测到的与ΛCDM模型的偏离贡献最为显著。

Abstract: Analyses by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration
suggest a significant deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model when their baryon
acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements are combined with Planck cosmic
microwave background (CMB) data and various Type Ia supernova (SNIa) samples.
In this work, we systematically investigate the origin of the deviations from
the $\Lambda$CDM reported in recent cosmological analyses by combining
different CMB datasets, BAO measurements, and DESY5 SNIa samples within the
$w_0w_a$CDM framework. We find that the DESY5 SNIa sample, particularly its
low-redshift component (DES-lowz), the Planck CMB data, the lensing
measurements of Planck and ACT-DR6, and the DESI-DR2 BAO measurements
contribute most significantly to the observed tensions. In contrast,
combinations involving DES-SN, WMAP, SPT, and ACT-DR6 remain consistent with
$\Lambda$CDM within $\sim1\sigma$. Our results highlight the critical impact of
SNIa systematics, CMB data, and the choice of BAO dataset on constraints of
dynamical dark energy models. These findings underscore the importance of
improved calibration, homogeneity, and cross-validation of observational
datasets to robustly assess potential deviations from the standard cosmological
model.

**TL;DR**: 将Minkowski张量扩展到红移空间各向异性信号分析，首次推导了扰动非高斯物质密度场中两类平移不变二阶张量的系综平均，并通过暗物质模拟验证了微扰理论的有效性，但发现Finger-of-God效应在较大尺度（R<20 Mpc/h）仍显著影响视线平行分量。

Background: 研究宇宙学中红移空间畸变引入的各向异性信号，扩展Minkowski张量的应用以分析非高斯密度场。

Data: 使用暗物质模拟数据验证理论预测，重点关注红移空间畸变引入的各向异性信号。

Method: 采用基于Edgeworth展开的微扰理论方法分析红移空间中非高斯物质密度场的Minkowski张量系综平均值。

Result: 推导了红移空间中二阶Minkowski张量的系综平均，并通过扰动理论成功关联了非高斯密度场与宇宙学参数。

Abstract: This paper focuses on extending the use of Minkowski Tensors to analyze
anisotropic signals in cosmological data, focusing on those introduced by
redshift space distortion. We derive the ensemble average of the two
translation-invariant, rank-2 Minkowski Tensors for a matter density field that
is perturbatively non-Gaussian in redshift space. This is achieved through the
Edgeworth expansion of the joint probability density function of the field and
its derivatives, expressing the ensemble averages in terms of cumulants up to
cubic order. Our goal is to connect these theoretical predictions to the
underlying cosmological parameters, allowing for parameter estimation by
measuring them from galaxy surveys. The work builds on previous analyses of
Minkowski Functionals in both real and redshift space and addresses the effects
of Finger-of-God velocity dispersion and shot noise. We validate our
predictions by matching them to measurements of the Minkowski Tensors from dark
matter simulation data, finding that perturbation theory is a qualified
success. Non-perturbative Finger-of-God effects remain significant at
relatively large scales (R< 20 Mpc/h) and are particularly pronounced in the
components parallel to the line of sight.

*G. K. Goswami,J. P. Saini*

**TL;DR**: 比较分析了f(R, Lm)引力和ΛCDM模型下宇宙结构形成、复合及物质-辐射平衡时期，发现f(R, Lm)模型中结构形成更早、复合期略长且物质-辐射平衡红移更高，保留了标准宇宙学关键特征但存在可观测差异。

Background: 探讨宇宙结构形成、复合时期和物质-辐射平衡等关键时期在f(R, Lm)引力和标准ΛCDM模型下的比较研究。

Data: 数据来源于Planck 2018观测数据以及基于f(R, L_m)引力和ΛCDM模型的非线性密度扰动演化方程计算。

Method: 采用非线性密度扰动演化方程和能见度函数分析，结合f(R, Lm)引力和ΛCDM模型框架进行对比研究。

Result: 在f(R, Lm)引力模型中宇宙结构形成更早，有效引力耦合增强导致塌缩红移提前。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative analysis of three pivotal epochs in
cosmic history: structure formation, recombination, and matter-radiation
equality, within the framework of $f(R, L_m)$ gravity and the standard
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Using a nonlinear evolution equation for density
perturbations, we determine the collapse redshift ($z_c$), showing that cosmic
structures form earlier in $f(R, L_m)$ gravity due to enhanced effective
gravitational coupling. Recombination is studied via the visibility function
$g(z)$, peaking at $z_{\mathrm{rec}} \approx 1092.6$ in both models, consistent
with Planck 2018 data. We compute the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of
$g(z)$ and find a slightly extended decoupling duration in $f(R, L_m)$.
Finally, we analyze the evolution of energy densities and determine the
matter-radiation equality redshift as $z_{\mathrm{eq}} \approx 4203$ in $f(R,
L_m)$ and $z_{\mathrm{eq}} \approx 2779$ in $\Lambda$CDM, with corresponding
cosmic times of approximately $67{,}756$ and $67{,}232$ years, respectively.
These results confirm that $f(R, L_m)$ gravity retains key cosmological
landmarks while introducing testable deviations from the standard paradigm.

**TL;DR**: 在红移z=5.725发现极贫金属星系AMORE6（氧丰度<0.2%太阳值），为验证大爆炸模型预测的第一代星系形成提供了关键证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 探索宇宙早期第一代星系的形成及其极低金属丰度特征。

Data: 使用公开可用的JWST NIRCam宽场无缝光谱（WFSS）数据。

Method: 利用JWST NIRCam宽场无缝光谱（WFSS）技术分析光谱数据。

Result: 发现了一个极低金属丰度（氧丰度低于太阳的0.20%）的星系AMORE6，其性质符合原始或近原始环境中大质量恒星形成的特征。

Abstract: The existence of galaxies with no elements such as Oxygen - formed by stars
after Big Bang nucleosynthesis - is a key prediction of the cosmological model.
Finding them would provide direct and transformative evidence of the formation
of the first galaxies in extremely different conditions than those observed
today. JWST has enabled the identification of galaxies all the way to cosmic
times of a few hundred million years. However, no pristine "zero-metallicity"
Population III galaxies have been identified so far. Here, we report the
identification of an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift z = 5.725
("AMORE6"), about one billion years after the Big Bang, observed near the
critical line of a foreground galaxy cluster, and thus multiply imaged and
magnified (mu = 39-78). Publicly available JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless
Spectroscopy (WFSS) spectra consistently detect H$\beta$ at both image
positions, but [O III]4960,5008 remains undetected. This places a firm upper
limit on its oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) < 6.0 (1 sigma), or < 0.20% of
solar metallicity. AMORE6 is characterized by low stellar mass (5.6+0.2-0.1 x
10^5 Msun), very blue rest-frame UV spectral slope, and extremely compact
morphology (effective radius re = 4.0+1.4-1.4 pc). These properties are
consistent with massive star formation in a pristine or near-pristine
environment. The finding of such an example at a relatively late time in cosmic
history is surprising. However, regardless of cosmic epoch, the identification
of a potentially pristine object is a key validation of the Big Bang model.

### [39] [Improved upper limits on the 21-cm signal power spectrum at $z=17.0$ and $z=20.3$ from an optimal field observed with NenuFAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10533)

**TL;DR**: 利用NenuFAR射电干涉仪观测数据，在红移20.3和17.0处获得了宇宙黎明时期21厘米信号功率谱的最严格上限，其中红移20.3的极限比以往研究低一个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 探索宇宙黎明时期（红移z>15）的21厘米信号功率谱，以揭示早期宇宙结构和星系形成过程。

Data: 使用NenuFAR射电干涉仪对宇宙黎明时期（红移z>15）的21厘米信号功率谱进行了四晚观测，数据来源于针对最小化旁瓣泄漏而选择的最优目标天区的观测，分别在红移z=20.3和z=17.0处获得26.1小时和23.6小时的积分时间。

Method: 采用NenuFAR射电干涉仪观测数据，通过改进数据处理流程（包括主瓣旁瓣强射电源扣除和低频射频干扰抑制）分析21厘米功率谱上限。

Result: 在宇宙黎明时期（红移z>15），首次获得了21厘米信号功率谱的最严格上限，其中z=20.3和z=17.0的最佳2σ上限分别为Δ²₂₁<4.6×10⁵ mK²和Δ²₂₁<5.0×10⁶ mK²。

Abstract: We report the deepest upper limits to date on the power spectrum of the 21-cm
signal during the Cosmic Dawn (redshifts: $z>15$), using four nights of
observations with the NenuFAR radio interferometer. The limits are derived from
two redshift bins, centred at $z=20.3$ and $z=17.0$, with integration times of
26.1 h and 23.6 h, from observations of an optimal target field chosen to
minimise sidelobe leakage from bright sources. Our analysis incorporates
improvements to the data processing pipeline, particularly in subtracting
strong radio sources in the primary beam sidelobes and mitigating low-level
radio frequency interference, yielding a 50-fold reduction in the excess
variance compared to a previous analysis of the north celestial pole field. At
$z=20.3$, we achieve a best $2\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta^{2}_{21}<4.6
\times 10^5 \, \textrm{mK}^{2}$ at $k=0.038$ $h\, \mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$, while at
$z=17.0$, the best limit is $\Delta^{2}_{21}<5.0 \times 10^6 \,
\textrm{mK}^{2}$ at $k=0.041$ $h\, \mathrm{cMpc}^{-1}$. These are the strongest
constraints on the 21-cm power spectrum at the respective redshifts, with the
limit at $z = 20.3$ being deeper by more than an order of magnitude over all
previous Cosmic Dawn power spectrum limits. Comparison against simulated exotic
21-cm signals shows that while the $z=20.3$ limits begin to exclude the most
extreme models predicting signals stronger than the EDGES detection, an
order-of-magnitude improvement would constrain signals compatible with EDGES. A
coherence analysis reveals that the excess variance is largely incoherent
across nights for the $z=20.3$ redshift bin, suggesting that deeper
integrations could yield significantly stronger constraints on the 21-cm signal
from the Cosmic Dawn.

Abstract: As cosmological simulations and their associated software become increasingly
complex, physicists face the challenge of searching through vast amounts of
literature and user manuals to extract simulation parameters from dense
academic papers, each using different models and formats. Translating these
parameters into executable scripts remains a time-consuming and error-prone
process. To improve efficiency in physics research and accelerate the
cosmological simulation process, we introduce SimAgents, a multi-agent system
designed to automate both parameter configuration from the literature and
preliminary analysis for cosmology research. SimAgents is powered by
specialized LLM agents capable of physics reasoning, simulation software
validation, and tool execution. These agents collaborate through structured
communication, ensuring that extracted parameters are physically meaningful,
internally consistent, and software-compliant. We also construct a cosmological
parameter extraction evaluation dataset by collecting over 40 simulations in
published papers from Arxiv and leading journals that cover diverse simulation
types. Experiments on the dataset demonstrate a strong performance of
SimAgents, highlighting its effectiveness and potential to accelerate
scientific research for physicists. Our demonstration video is available at:
https://youtu.be/w1zLpm_CaWA. The complete system and dataset are publicly
available at https://github.com/xwzhang98/SimAgents.

Abstract: NASA's Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is a flagship astrophysics mission
planned for launch no later than May 2027. The Coronagraph Instrument (CGI)
aboard Roman will demonstrate the technology for direct imaging and
spectroscopy of exoplanets around nearby stars and starlight suppression that
surpass previous space-based and ground-based coronagraphs. This is
accomplished using active wavefront control in space with deformable mirrors.
CGI requires a star acquisition system capable of acquiring reference and
target stars to achieve this goal. This paper describes two CGI star
acquisition system methods: EXCAM and Raster Scan. Furthermore, it will detail
the results of the CGI thermal vacuum (TVAC) tests conducted to evaluate
system-level star acquisition and verify its performance requirements.

Abstract: We present analog clocks fitted to the Mars solar day. These clocks use the
standard Earth-based second of the International System of Units (SI) as their
operational unit of time, unlike current practice for Mars timekeeping. We
discuss the importance of preserving the SI second. On this basis, we identify
the two analog clocks most suitable for public use by a future Mars population.
These are a 20-hour clock with a hand motion similar to that of the standard
Earth clock, and a 24-hour clock with a novel "Martian" hand motion which
strikes the hour when all 3 hands converge onto that hour mark on the dial.
Both clocks have Earth-day equivalents to assist learning. We also present a
24-hour "SpaceClock", similar to the Martian clock but with no favored
reference plane, hence equally readable from any viewing orientation.

Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has led to significant advances in our
understanding of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. These new insights have driven
a major upgrade of the Observatory, known as AugerPrime, through which the
experiment has entered its Phase II, a new period of data collection. A key
part of the upgrade is adding surface scintillator detectors (SSD) on top of
the existing water-Cherenkov detectors (WCD). The main goal is to leverage
their different responses to the electromagnetic and muonic shower components,
enhancing the reconstruction of the primary cosmic-ray mass. In this
contribution, we present the methods that involve analyzing peak and charge
distributions of atmospheric muons for accurate calibration during extensive
air-shower event reconstruction, along with the development of a rate-based
algorithm for independent calibration. We also show the performance of the SSDs
with Phase-II data, including PMT reliability and stability of key parameters,
such as gain and signal-to-noise ratio.

Abstract: Ultra-high-energy photons have long been sought as tracers of the most
energetic processes in the Universe. Several sources can contribute to a
diffuse photon flux, including interactions of cosmic rays with Galactic matter
and radiation fields, as well as more exotic scenarios such as the decay of
super-heavy dark matter. Regardless of their origin, the expected flux is
extremely low, making direct detection impractical and thereby requiring
indirect detection by extensive ground-based detector arrays. In this
contribution, we present a novel method for photon-hadron discrimination in the
energy range of $50$ to $300\,\text{PeV}$ based on deep learning algorithms.
Our approach relies on information from both the Surface Detector (SD) and the
Underground Muon Detector (UMD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The SD
consists of an array of water-Cherenkov detectors. It is used to measure the
electromagnetic and muonic components of extensive air showers at ground level.
Meanwhile, the UMD is composed of buried scintillator modules. It is sensitive
to air-shower muons with energies above ${\sim}1\,\text{GeV}$, enhancing the
identification of muon-poor air showers as initiated by photon primaries. Our
method represents air-shower events as graphs, and consequently, the network
architecture is composed of graph attention layers. We assess the performance
of the method on a data subset and discuss the implications of unblinding the
full current dataset, as well as the prospects of the increasing data volume
expected in the coming years, particularly in terms of sensitivity to various
diffuse fluxes from theoretical predictions.

Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of automatic differentiation (AD)
applications in astrophysics, identifying domains where gradient-based
optimization could provide significant computational advantages. Building on
our previous work with GRAF (Gradient-based Radar Ambiguity Functions), which
discovered optimal radar waveforms achieving 4x computational speedup by
exploring the trade-off space between conflicting objectives, we extend this
discovery-oriented approach to astrophysical parameter spaces. While AD has
been successfully implemented in several areas including gravitational wave
parameter estimation and exoplanet atmospheric retrieval, we identify nine
astrophysical domains where, to our knowledge, gradient-based exploration
methods remain unexplored despite favorable mathematical structure. These
opportunities range from discovering novel solutions to the Einstein field
equations in exotic spacetime configurations to systematically exploring
parameter spaces in stellar astrophysics and planetary dynamics. We present the
mathematical foundations for implementing AD in each domain and propose GRASP
(Gradient-based Reconstruction of Astrophysical Systems & Phenomena), a unified
framework for differentiable astrophysical computations that transforms
traditional optimization problems into systematic exploration of solution
spaces. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically delineate
unexplored domains in astrophysics suitable for automatic differentiation and
to provide a unified, mathematically grounded framework (GRASP) to guide their
implementation.

final phase of GRAND aims to be sensitive enough to detect them in spite of
their plausibly tiny flux. Three prototype GRAND radio arrays have been in
operation since 2023: GRANDProto300, in China, GRAND@Auger, in Argentina, and
GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay, in France. Their goals are to field-test the GRAND detection
units, understand the radio background to which they are exposed, and develop
tools for diagnostic, data gathering, and data analysis. This list of
contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025)
presents an overview of GRAND, in its present and future incarnations, and a
first look at data collected by GRANDProto300 and GRAND@Auger, including the

Abstract: In January of 1985, more than 40 years ago, a group of astronomers met with
NASA officials to map out the future of NASA space astronomy. Their efforts led
to the Great Observatories program, linking four powerful space telescopes to
study the heavens in four regions of the spectrum. The successful launch and
operation of the Spitzer Space Telescope in the Fall of 2003 completed the
launch of the Great Observatories, almost 20 years after the program was
formulated, and two of the Observatories, Hubble and Chandra, continue to
operate very productively. The scientific and public education results of the
Great Observatories are well-known. Here we emphasize that fulfilling the
extraordinary vision of the Great Observatories was a triumph of human
ingenuity, dedication, and determination.

Background: 利用神经网络方法改进星系恒星质量估计，为天体物理参数估算提供高效、低计算成本的机器学习解决方案。

Result: 利用单隐藏层全连接神经网络基于多波段测光数据准确预测恒星质量，误差仅为0.085和0.1 dex，且FUV-NUV颜色指数成为关键预测因子。

Abstract: A simple, fully connected neural network with a single hidden layer is used
to estimate stellar masses for star-forming galaxies. The model is trained on
broad-band photometry - from far-ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths -
generated by the Semi-Analytic Model of galaxy formation (SHARK), along with
derived colour indices. It accurately reproduces the known SHARK stellar masses
with respective root-mean-square and median errors of only 0.085 and 0.1 dex
over the three decades in stellar mass. Analysis of the trained network's
parameters reveals several colour indices to be particularly effective
predictors of stellar mass. In particular, the FUV - NUV colour emerges as a
strong determinant, suggesting that the network has implicitly learned to
account for attenuation effects in the ultraviolet bands, thereby increasing
the diagnostic power of this index. Traditional methods such as spectral energy
distribution fitting, though widely used, are often complex, computationally
expensive, and sensitive to model assumptions and parameter degeneracies. In
contrast, the neural network relies solely on easily obtained observables,
enabling rapid and accurate stellar mass predictions at minimal computational
cost. The model derives its predictions exclusively from patterns learned in
the data, without any built-in physical assumptions (such as stellar initial
mass function). These results demonstrate the utility of this study's machine
learning approach in astrophysical parameter estimation and highlight its
potential to complement conventional techniques in upcoming large galaxy
surveys.

Background: 研究毫米波射电天文观测中利用频率相位转移技术校正大气相位波动以提高甚长基线干涉测量在高频段的灵敏度和成像质量。

Data: 数据来源于APEX望远镜新接收器N3AR在67至116 GHz频段的观测，以及与IRAM 30米望远镜共享光路的双频段VLBI同步观测。

Method: 采用频率相位传递（FPT）技术校正大气相位波动，通过共享光路（SOP）接收机实现双频同时观测。

Result: 成功验证了在250 GHz以上频率使用共享光路接收器和频率相位转移技术可显著提高高频VLBI的相位相干性和灵敏度。

Abstract: The receiver N3AR operating at a frequency range between 67 and 116 GHz has
been commissioned at the APEX telescope in October 2024. This adds a new
low-frequency band for APEX, with the capability of simultaneous dual-frequency
observations using a dichroic beamsplitter. The 3 mm receiver also allows APEX
to join the existing 3 mm global VLBI network. One of our commissioning goals
was to perform simultaneous dual-band VLBI observations at 86 and 258 GHz using
receivers with shared-optical-paths (SOP) to correct the atmospheric phase
fluctuations using the frequency phase transfer (FPT) technique. This was
possible together with the IRAM 30 m telescope, which has already developed
such a capability. We aimed to verify the expected phase coherence and
sensitivity improvement at the higher frequency achievable by applying FPT.
With the dual-band, single baseline data, we applied the FPT method, which uses
the lower frequency data to correct the simultaneously observed
higher-frequency data. We evaluate the improvement compared to the conventional
single-band observing mode by analyzing the coherence factor in the higher
frequency data. Our results show that the phase fluctuations at the two bands
are well correlated. After applying FPT, the interferometric phases at the
higher frequency vary much slower and the coherence factor is significantly
improved. Our analysis confirms the feasibility of applying FPT to frequencies
above 250 GHz with SOP receivers. Future observations in this mode could
dramatically improve the sensitivity and imaging fidelity of high-frequency
VLBI.

**TL;DR**: 采用改进势垒模型研究了基态$^{15}$N(p,γ)$^{16}$O辐射俘获反应，发现$^{3}S_1$共振干涉显著影响低能S因子及反应速率，级联跃迁使速率在高温区提升30%。

Background: 研究恒星能量下$^{15}$N($p,\gamma _{0}$)$^{16}$O反应的核天体物理过程及其在CNO循环中的作用。

Data: 使用改进的势垒集群模型（MPCM）结合实验数据（包括Imbriani等人2012年的专有数据）进行理论计算，并分析低能共振态对反应截面的影响。

Method: 采用改进的势阱簇模型（MPCM）结合禁戒态和低能共振态分析辐射俘获反应。

Result: 通过改进的势垒簇模型计算得出$^{15}$N($p,\gamma_{0}$)$^{16}$O反应的天体物理S因子在34.7-40.4 keV·b范围内，并揭示了$^{3}S_{1}$(312)和$^{3}S_{1}$(962)共振干涉的重要作用。

Abstract: We study a radiative $p^{15}$N capture on the ground state of $^{16}$O at
stellar energies within the framework of a modified potential cluster model
(MPCM) with forbidden states, including low-lying resonances. The investigation
of the $^{15}$N($p,\gamma _{0}$)$^{16}$O reaction includes the consideration of
$^{3}S_{1}$ resonances due to $E1$ transitions and the contribution of
$^{3}P_{1}$ scattering wave in $p$ + $^{15}$N channel due to
$^{3}P_{1}\longrightarrow $ $^{3}P_{0}$ $M1$ transition. We calculated the
astrophysical low-energy $S-$factor, and extrapolated $S(0)$ turned out to be
within $34.7-40.4$ keV$\cdot $b. The important role of the asymptotic constant
(AC) for the $^{15}$N($p,\gamma _{0}$)$^{16}$O process with interfering
$^{3}S_{1}$(312) and $^{3}S_{1}$(962) resonances is elucidated. A comparison of
our calculation for $S-$factor with existing experimental and theoretical data
is addressed, and a reasonable agreement is found.
  The reaction rate is calculated and compared with the existing rates. It has
negligible dependence on the variation of AC, but shows a strong impact of the
interference of $^{3}S_{1}$(312) and $^{3}S_{1}$(962) resonances, especially at
temperatures, referring to the CNO Gamow windows. We estimate the contribution
of cascade transitions to the reaction rate based on the exclusive experimental
data by \textit{Imbriani, et al. 2012}. The reaction rate enhancement due to
the cascade transitions is observed from $T_{9} > 0.3 $ and reaches the maximum
factor $\sim $\ 1.3 at $T_{9}=1.3$.
  We present the Gamow energy window and a comparison of rates for radiative
proton capture reactions $^{12}$N($p,\gamma $)$^{13}$O, $^{13}$N($p,\gamma $)
$^{14}$O, $^{14}$N($p,\gamma $)$^{15}$O, and $^{15}$N($p,\gamma $)$^{16}$O
obtained in the framework of the MPCM and give temperature windows, prevalence,

Result: 残余引力子的多重性分布在不同物理参数区域分别符合泊松、玻色-爱因斯坦、伽马和帕斯卡概率分布。

Abstract: When the gravitons are created thanks to the variation of the space-time
curvature the multiplicity distributions quantify the probability of producing
a given number of species around the average occupation numbers of the
underlying multiparticle states. The multiplicities of the relic gravitons are
infinitely divisible and their analytical expressions encompass, in different
regions of the physical parameters, the Poisson, Bose-Einstein, Gamma and
Pascal probability distributions. Depending upon the post-inflationary
timelines, the averaged multiplicities are controlled by the range of the
comoving frequencies and they can be much larger in the GHz region than in the
aHz domain where the temperature and polarization anisotropies of the microwave
background set strict limits on the spectral energy density of the relic
gravitons. Thanks to the absolute upper bound on the maximal frequency of the
gravitons we can acknowledge that the averaged multiplicities are exponentially
suppressed above the THz, where only few pairs of gravitons are independently
created from the vacuum. The statistical properties of the produced particles
can be finally interpreted in the light of the second-order interference
effects and this perspective is quantitatively scrutinized by analyzing the
associated quantum sensitivities. For putative instruments reaching spectral
amplitudes ${\mathcal O}(10^{-35})/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ in the MHz or GHz bands,
the Bose-Einstein correlations could be used to probe the properties of cosmic
gravitons and their super-Poissonian statistics. Both from the theoretical and
observational viewpoint it is unjustified to require the same sensitivities
(e.g. ${\mathcal O}(10^{-21})/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$) in the kHz and GHz domains.

Abstract: We investigate an interacting dark energy-dark matter model within the
quintessence framework, characterized by the coupling term $Q_0 = \alpha \kappa
\rho_m \dot{\phi} \left[1 - \beta R^2/(6H^2) \right]$, and the scalar field
evolves under an exponential potential $V(\phi) = V_0 e^{-\lambda \kappa
\phi}$, with parameters $\alpha$, $\lambda$, and $\beta$. Recasting the
cosmological equations into a first-order autonomous system using dimensionless
variables, we perform a phase space analysis to identify conditions for stable,
non-phantom accelerating attractors. The Ricci scalar term, controlled by
$\beta$, significantly affects the stability of critical points, with
attractors transitioning to repellers for higher values of $\beta$. We also
analyze linear scalar perturbations, focusing on the matter density contrast
$\delta_m$ and the growth index $\gamma$. Additionally, we compute the
deceleration and jerk parameters, the Hubble rate, and the distance modulus
$\mu(z)$, showing good agreement with observational data. The model naturally
addresses the cosmic coincidence problem through scalar field tracking
behavior. For moderate parameter values, matter perturbations continue to grow
into the future, capturing both background and perturbative dynamics
effectively. This framework thus offers a consistent and observationally viable
approach to interacting dark energy.

Abstract: We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from the collapse of

PGWs' interpretation of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB)
detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) corresponds to PBHs formation in the
mass range $[10^{-12}-10^{-3}] M_{\odot}$. Importantly, our analysis shows that
PGWs' interpretation of recent PTA data remains viable, as it does not lead to
PBH overproduction. We derive the amplitude of PGWs by leveraging existing
constraints on the PBH abundance across a wide mass range. Notably, these
constrained amplitudes predict SGWB signals that would be detectable by future
gravitational wave observatories.

Result: 月基引力波天线（LGWA）和地面第三代引力波探测器（ET）的多波段观测可有效探测整个中等质量黑洞（IMBH）质量谱，显著提升对IMBH种群分布的探测能力。

Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) detection offers a novel approach to exploring
intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). The GW signals from IMBH mergers mainly
fall in the decihertz frequency band. The lunar-based GW detector, the Lunar
Gravitational-Wave Antenna (LGWA), exhibits high sensitivity in this band,
making it particularly well-suited for detecting IMBHs. However, for lower-mass
IMBHs, the late inspiral and merger signals enter the sensitive frequency range
of ground-based GW detectors. In this work, we aim to explore how multi-band
observations with LGWA and the third-generation ground-based GW detector, the
Einstein Telescope (ET), can contribute to detecting the population of IMBHs.
We consider three population distribution cases of IMBHs, including two
population models based on astrophysical motivations and a uniform
distribution, and compute the signal-to-noise ratios for LGWA, ET, and their
combination to directly compare their capabilities in detecting IMBH mergers.
Our results suggest that LGWA possesses strong detection capability for
high-mass IMBH mergers. At redshift $z = 1$, LGWA's detection rate for IMBH
binaries with primary masses above $5 \times 10^4~M_\odot$ is largely
insensitive to orbital inclination and mass ratio. In contrast, ET is more
suited for detecting IMBH binaries with primary masses below $10^3~M_\odot$.
The multi-band observation of LGWA and ET possesses strong detection
capabilities across the full IMBH mass spectrum. Furthermore, we find that the
multi-band detection can significantly and effectively recover the IMBH
population distributions. In summary, we conclude that the multi-band
observations of LGWA and ET will provide powerful detection capabilities for
IMBHs and are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of this
important yet still poorly observed class of black holes.

Result: 提出了一种通过重加权单信号参数估计后验来量化信号重叠影响的新方法，在零噪声注入下准确率达99%（高斯噪声下98%）。

Abstract: Third-generation gravitational wave detectors such as Einstein Telescope and
Cosmic Explorer will have significantly better sensitivities than current
detectors, as well as a wider frequency bandwidth. This will increase the
number and duration of the observed signals, leading to many signals
overlapping in time. If not adequately accounted for, this can lead to biases
in parameter estimation. In this work, we combine the joint parameter
estimation method with relative binning to handle full parameter inference on
overlapping signals from binary black holes, including precession effects and
higher-order mode content. As this method is computationally more expensive
than traditional single-signal parameter estimation, we test a prior-informed
Fisher matrix and a time-frequency overlap method for estimating expected bias
to help us decide when joint parameter estimation is necessary over the simpler
methods. We improve upon previous Fisher matrix implementations by including
the prior information and performing an optimization routine to better locate
the maximum likelihood point point, but we still find the method unreliable.
The time-frequency method is accurate in 86% of close binary black hole
mergers. We end by developing our own method of estimating bias due overlaps,
where we reweight the single signal parameter estimation posterior to quantify
how much the overlapping signals affect it.We show it has 99% accuracy for zero
noise injections (98% in Gaussian noise), at the cost of one additional
standard sampling run when joint parameter estimation proves to be necessary.

### [59] [Muon Signal Charge in the Underground Muon Detector of AugerPrime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09006)
*Marina Scornavacche*

**TL;DR**: 提出新校准策略消除地下μ子探测器因穿透粒子与物质相互作用导致的信号电荷测量偏差，确保μ子数量估计无偏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究背景聚焦于地下μ子探测器的校准方法优化，强调穿透粒子与物质相互作用对能量沉积的影响。

Data: 数据来源于2019年至2024年间Pierre Auger Observatory地下μ子探测器采集的信号电荷测量数据。

Method: 基于信号电荷测量并通过考虑穿透粒子与物质的相互作用提出新的校准策略。

Result: 提出了一种新的校准策略以消除穿透粒子通过物质时产生击出电子对塑料闪烁体探测器能量沉积的影响，从而获得无偏的μ子估计量。

Abstract: The Underground Muon Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory features a
calorimetric detection mode that estimates the number of muons based on signal
charge measurements. This contribution provides an overview of the calibration
procedure, revisiting the previously published strategy and identifying a bias
introduced by the triggers used to estimate the mean charge deposited by a
vertical muon. We demonstrate that calibrating underground detectors requires
careful consideration of the interactions of penetrating particles through
matter. In devices based on plastic scintillators, energy deposition, and thus
the recorded charge, is significantly affected by knock-on electron production
in the surrounding ground as muons traverse the medium. To mitigate this
effect, we propose a new calibration strategy that ensures an unbiased muon
estimator. This approach is applied to data collected from 2019 to 2024.

### [60] [MVPinn: Integrating Milne-Eddington Inversion with Physics-Informed Neural Networks for GST/NIRIS Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09430)
*Qin Li,Bo Shen,Haodi Jiang,Vasyl B. Yurchyshyn,Taylor Baildon,Kangwoo Yi,Wenda Cao,Haimin Wang*

**TL;DR**: 提出MVPinn方法，通过将Milne-Eddington辐射传输方程嵌入神经网络训练，显著提升太阳Fe I 1.56μm谱线偏振观测的磁场参数反演精度和效率，在15秒内完成传统方法需数十分钟的反演任务，与SDO/HMI和Hinode/SOT-SP实测数据相关性达90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究主题为基于物理信息神经网络（PINN）改进传统Milne-Eddington反演方法，以提升太阳高分辨率光谱偏振观测中磁场参数反演的精度与效率。

Data: 数据来源于大熊湖太阳观测台近红外成像光谱偏振仪（BBSO/NIRIS）在Fe I 1.56 μm谱线处的观测数据。

Method: 采用基于物理信息神经网络（PINN）的MVPinn方法，将Milne-Eddington辐射传输方程嵌入神经网络训练作为物理约束，高效反演磁场参数。

Result: MVPinn方法通过将Milne-Eddington辐射传输方程嵌入神经网络训练，显著提升了磁场参数反演的准确性、噪声鲁棒性及处理非对称弱偏振信号的能力。

Abstract: We introduce MVPinn, a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) approach
tailored for solving the Milne-Eddington (ME) inversion problem, specifically
applied to spectropolarimetric observations from the Big Bear Solar
Observatory's Near-InfraRed Imaging Spectropolarimeter (BBSO/NIRIS) at the Fe I
1.56 {\mu}m lines. Traditional ME inversion methods, though widely used, are
computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, and often struggle to accurately
capture complex profile asymmetries resulting from gradients in magnetic field
strength, orientation, and line-of-sight velocities. By embedding the ME
radiative transfer equations directly into the neural network training as
physics-informed constraints, our MVPinn method robustly and efficiently
retrieves magnetic field parameters, significantly outperforming traditional
inversion methods in accuracy, noise resilience, and the ability to handle
asymmetric and weak polarization signals. After training, MVPinn infers one
magnetogram in about 15 seconds, compared to tens of minutes required by
traditional ME inversion on high-resolution spectropolarimetric data.
Quantitative comparisons demonstrate excellent agreement with well-established
magnetic field measurements from the SDO/HMI and Hinode/SOT-SP instruments,
with correlation coefficients of approximately 90%. In particular, MVPINN
aligns better with Hinode/SOT-SP data, indicating some saturation of HMI data
at high magnetic strengths. We further analyze the physical significance of
profile asymmetries and the limitations inherent in the ME model assumption.
Our results illustrate the potential of physics-informed machine learning
methods in high-spatial-temporal solar observations, preparing for more
sophisticated, real-time magnetic field analysis essential for current and
next-generation solar telescopes and space weather monitoring.

*Jiadong Li,Hans-Walter Rix,Yuan-Sen Ting,Johanna Müller-Horn,Kareem El-Badry,Chao Liu,Rhys Seeburger,Gregory M. Green,Xiangyu Zhang*

**TL;DR**: 基于盖亚DR3 BP/RP光谱数据开发前向建模方法识别主序双星系统，构建了包含1400万候选双星的高质量样本，并区分了亮伴星与致密天体伴星系统，为双星形成演化及致密天体研究提供了新见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 利用盖亚望远镜数据研究银河系主序双星系统的形成与演化。

Data: 数据来源于 Gaia Data Release 3 BP/RP (XP) 光谱，初始样本包含 35 million 颗距离在 1 kpc 以内的恒星。

Method: 采用神经网络前向建模方法，通过单星与双星模型拟合的统计比较识别双星系统。

Result: 基于盖亚DR3 BP/RP光谱数据，开发了神经网络前向建模方法，识别出1400万主序双星候选体，包括100万高质量样本，揭示了双星系统质量比在0.4-1.0区间的分布特征。

Abstract: We present the main-sequence binary (MSMS) Catalog derived from Gaia Data
Release 3 BP/RP (XP) spectra. Leveraging the vast sample of low-resolution Gaia
XP spectra, we develop a forward modeling approach that maps stellar mass and
photometric metallicity to XP spectra using a neural network. Our methodology
identifies binary systems through statistical comparison of single- and
binary-star model fits, enabling detection of binaries with mass ratios between
0.4 and 1.0 and flux ratios larger than 0.1. From an initial sample of 35
million stars within 1 kpc, we identify 14 million binary candidates and define
a high-confidence "golden sample" of 1 million binary systems. This large,
homogeneous sample enables detailed statistical analysis of binary properties
across diverse Galactic environments, providing new insights into binary star
formation and evolution. In addition, the $\chi^2$ comparison allows us to
distinguish stars with luminous companions from single stars or binaries with
dark companions, such as white dwarfs, neutron stars and black hole candidates,
improving our understanding of compact object populations.

### [62] [Bringing the Norma Dark Cloud to Light in X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09047)
*Stephen L. Skinner,Manuel Guedel,Luisa M. Rebull*

**TL;DR**: 首次对Norma暗云西部的Sandqvist 187区域进行X射线观测，发现121个独特X射线源并识别出年轻恒星候选体，为研究该区域恒星形成提供新线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究南十字座暗丝状云复合体中的低质量恒星形成活动及其X射线观测。

Data: 数据来源于Chandra和XMM-Newton的X射线观测，以及现有的近红外测光数据和Gaia视差数据。

Method: 采用Chandra和XMM-Newton的X射线观测数据，结合近红外测光和Gaia视差分析。

Result: 首次在Norma暗云复合体的Sandqvist 187区域探测到121个X射线源，其中部分源具有年轻恒星盘特征，Gaia视差确认了500-1000 pc距离的可能云团成员。

Abstract: The filamentary dark cloud complex in Norma reveals signs of active low-mass
star formation including protostars, H-alpha emission line stars, Herbig Haro
objects, and the eruptive FU Orionis-like star V346 Nor. We present results of
the first pointed X-ray observations of the Norma dark cloud, focusing on the
westernmost Sandqvist 187 region. Chandra detected 75 X-ray sources and a
complementary XMM-Newton observation detected 92 sources within the Chandra
field-of-view, of which 46 are cross-matched to Chandra, yielding 121 unique
X-ray sources. We present a catalog of X-ray sources along with basic X-ray
properties and candidate IR and optical counterparts. Existing near-IR
photometry reveals several X-ray sources with color excesses as typical of
young stars with disks. Gaia parallaxes single out foreground stars and X-ray
sources with distances of 500 - 1000 pc that are probable cloud members. The
known emission line stars Sz 136 and Sz 137 were detected but V346 Nor was not.
Interestingly, the optical and IR counterparts of the brightest Chandra source
are not known with certainty but the prime suspects are very faint. Thus, the
nature of the object responsible for the bright X-ray emission remains
speculative. The X-ray observations presented here will serve as a pathfinder
for identifying and characterizing the young stellar population in the Norma
dark cloud.

### [63] [A population analysis of Galactic Miras with light-curve asymmetries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09653)
*Stefan Uttenthaler,Pedro Merchan-Benitez*

**TL;DR**: 发现M型米拉变星存在两个不同群体：光变曲线对称的群体初始质量较低，不对称的群体具有第三挖掘活动特征，是通向S型米拉变星的演化环节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 探讨M型米拉变星的光变曲线不对称性与其尘埃质量损失率及第三挖掘活动的关系，揭示其在M-S-C光谱序列中的演化状态。

Data: 数据来源于ASAS数据库的3100颗Mira变星样本，并结合了2MASS-WISE颜色和Gaia-2MASS图的质量损失率指标。

Method: 通过分析3100颗Mira变星的光变曲线不对称性，结合2MASS-WISE颜色和Gaia-2MASS图确定质量损失率指标。

Result: M型米拉变星存在两个不同群体：具有对称光变曲线的群体初始质量较低，而具有不对称光变曲线的群体显示出第三挖掘活动迹象，是通向S型米拉变星的演化环节。

Abstract: Context: In a recent publication, we established a close relationship between
light-curve asymmetries in Mira variables and indicators of their dust
mass-loss rate. The light-curve asymmetries appear to be related to the stars'
third dredge-up (3DUP) activity. Aims: We aim to reveal the evolutionary status
of M-type Miras with light-curve asymmetries ('bumps') within the spectral
sequence M -- S -- C, determine their mass-loss properties, and check possible
evolutionary scenarios. Methods: We analysed a sample of 3100 Miras collected
from the ASAS database, distinguishing between symmetric and asymmetric light
curves. We determined their periods, luminosity functions, and
period-luminosity relations, their locations relative to the Galactic midplane,
as well as mass-loss rate indicators through the 2MASS-WISE colours and the
Gaia-2MASS diagram. Results: The M-type Miras with symmetric light curves are
generally found to have shorter periods, lower luminosities, a larger average
distance to the Galactic midplane, and lower initial masses than the M-type
Miras with asymmetries. In addition, 25 Miras are proposed as candidates for
new carbon stars. Conclusions: We propose that the M-type Miras have two
distinct populations: M-type Miras with symmetric light curves, which have
lower initial mass progenitors than M-type Miras with asymmetries, which show
signs of 3DUP activity and are the link to the S-type Miras.

### [64] [Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the MagnetoPause (CRIMP): A Mission Concept to Uncover the Impact of Mesoscale Reconnection and Plasma Outflow Processes at the Dayside Magnetopause](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09722)

**TL;DR**: 提出CRIMP任务概念，利用双航天器测量地球磁层顶中尺度结构和粒子外流，揭示局部质量密度增强对全球磁重联的影响、中尺度结构驱动磁层顶动态的机制，以及磁层顶是否完全吸收辐射带电子。


<details>

Background: 研究地球磁层顶的介尺度结构和粒子外流及其对磁重联和能量传输过程的影响。

Data: 使用两艘相同航天器在磁层顶进行多点同步测量，观测数据来自航天器在1-3个地球半径尺度上的磁层顶区域测量。

Method: 采用双航天器多点和同步测量技术分析磁层顶介尺度结构和粒子外流。

Result: 通过双航天器独特相位配置测量，揭示了磁层顶1-3地球半径尺度上介观结构对磁重联和能量传输过程的关键影响。

Abstract: The Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the Magnetopause (CRIMP)
mission is a Heliophysics Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) Announcement of
Opportunity (AO) mission concept designed to study mesoscale structures and
particle outflow along Earth's magnetopause using two identical spacecraft.
CRIMP would uncover the impact of magnetosheath mesoscale drivers, dayside
magnetopause mesoscale phenomenological processes and structures, and localized
plasma outflows on magnetic reconnection and the energy transfer process in the
dayside magnetosphere. CRIMP accomplishes this through uniquely phased
spacecraft configurations that allow multipoint, contemporaneous measurements
at the magnetopause. This enables an unparalleled look at mesoscale spatial
differences along the dayside magnetopause on the scale of 1-3 Earth Radii
(Re). Through these measurements, CRMIP will uncover how local mass density
enhancements affect global reconnection, how mesoscale structures drive
magnetopause dynamics, and if the magnetopause acts as a perfectly absorbing
boundary for radiation belt electrons. This allows CRIMP to determine the
spatial scale, extent, and temporal evolution of energy and mass transfer
processes at the magnetopause - crucial measurements to determine how the solar
wind energy input in the magnetosphere is transmitted between regions and
across scales. This concept was conceived as a part of the 2024 NASA
Heliophysics Mission Design School.

Background: 研究X射线双星中的准周期振荡有助于理解致密天体周围的吸积物理过程。

Result: 在20-300 mHz范围内观测到的M82 X-1准周期振荡行为与吸积致密天体中的其他低频振荡类似。

Abstract: The study of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray binaries provides valuable
insights into the physics of accretion around compact objects. The M82 galaxy
hosts two ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), one of which is suspected to
harbor an intermediate-mass black hole. Using 39 NuSTAR observations acquired
between 2014--2024, we investigate the aperiodic X-ray variability in M82. In
particular, we study in detail the evolution of the QPO from M82 X-1 in the
range 20--300 mHz. We do not find additional timing features in the data,
besides a frequent broad noise component at lower frequencies. The QPO behaves
similarly to other classes of low-frequency oscillations in accreting compact
objects, both black holes and neutron stars.

Abstract: The detection of extensive air showers using radio antennas has evolved into
a mature technique, complementing particle detector arrays by providing
sensitivity to the longitudinal development of the showers and enabling an
independent determination of the cosmic-ray energy. Both the Pierre Auger
Observatory in Argentina and the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at the South Pole
have been undergoing upgrades, including the integration of radio antennas. The
next-generation neutrino detector IceCube-Gen2 will also feature a surface
array for PeV-EeV cosmic-ray detection, consisting of scintillation detectors
and radio antennas. Prototype stations for this upgrade have been in operation
for several years at both, the South Pole and the Auger Observatory, enabling
cross-checks and potentially a cross-calibration of the energy scales between
the two experiments. In this contribution, we present an analysis of air
showers observed with the radio antennas of the IceCube-Gen2 prototype station,
coinciding with detections by the water-Cherenkov detectors of the densest part
of the Pierre Auger Observatory's surface array, featuring a 433 m spacing.

Background: 探索超高能中微子通量上限及多信使天体物理背景下的瞬变事件观测。

Data: 数据来源于Pierre Auger Observatory的大型表面探测器阵列（SD）采集的观测数据，包括2013年新增的ToTd和MoPS触发机制所增强的探测能力下的数据。

Method: 采用时间超阈值解卷积和多步正触发技术增强探测能力，并应用盲搜索策略整合新型触发方法识别中微子事件。

Result: 通过整合ToTd和MoPS触发器的新方法，在60° < θ < 75°天顶角范围内显著提高了超高能中微子的探测灵敏度。

Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory has the capability to identify neutrino-induced
extensive air showers above $10^{17}$ eV by using its large Surface Detector
(SD) array. Data from the Observatory have been used to set some of the most
stringent upper limits to the neutrino flux in the ultra-high energy (UHE)
range. The data have also been used for follow-up detection of transient events
in the context of multi-messenger astrophysics. In mid-2013, two additional SD
triggers (Time-over-Threshold-deconvolved (ToTd) and Multiplicity-of-Positive
Steps (MoPS)) were shown to increase the detection capability for the
neutrino-induced air showers in the energy regime below $10^{19}$ eV by a
factor of 5-10. This contribution will give an overview of the ongoing work
regarding the searches for UHE neutrinos at the Pierre Auger Observatory. The
impact of the ToTd and MoPS triggers for neutrino search in the zenith angle
range of $60^{\circ} < \theta < 75^{\circ}$ is discussed. A novel neutrino
identification method, which integrates these triggers, is applied to
observational data to look for neutrino-like events using a $\textit{blind}$
search strategy. New constraints to point-like sources of UHE neutrinos will be
presented for the angular range explored.

Result: 升级后的探测器实现了对超高能宇宙射线的质量敏感测量和μ子含量直接测量。

Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory consists of 1660 water-Cherenkov detectors
(WCDs) and 27 fluorescence telescopes, covering a surface of 3000 km2 in the
province of Mendoza, Argentina. After almost two decades, Auger Phase I has
ended the data taking and has already delivered many outstanding physics
results. The Auger Observatory is currently running in Phase II, with upgraded
detectors for enhanced data of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). During
Phase I, several engineering detectors were developed and tested. Some of those
developments led to new detectors, which are now part of the upgraded
Observatory. For Phase II, the WCDs were upgraded with a surface-scintillator
detector, a radio detector, a small photomultiplier, and an upgraded
electronics board, facilitating mass-sensitive measurements for source
identification of UHECRs. Moreover, an underground muon detector allows for a
direct measurement of the muon content of air showers. The Offline framework is
the main software for the event reconstruction and detector simulation at the
Pierre Auger Observatory. It is continuously being developed to accommodate
changes in the detector and new algorithms. It allows the running of various
applications, which are made up of individual modules, either on raw data or
simulations on an event-by-event basis. Large productions of shower and
detector reference libraries are done with CORSIKA 7 and Offline on the
European Grid Infrastructure (EGI) using the Virtual Organization Auger.
Various air-shower geometries (up to 89 degrees in zenith) were considered, as
well as several primary particles (from light to ultra-heavy nuclei, photons,
and neutrinos), hadronic interaction models and detector configurations for
Phase I and Phase II. In this contribution, we present the actual efforts and
updates on software for data production and reference Monte Carlo simulations
for Auger data analysis.

Background: 研究太阳活动释放的能量与地球电离层相互作用及其对无线电波传播的影响。

Data: 数据来源于皮埃尔·奥格天文台的Auger工程无线电阵列（AERA）约11年的观测数据，并结合了e-CALLISTO网络和SWAVES仪器的独立太阳射电暴观测数据。

Method: 采用AERA阵列测量30-80 MHz频段太阳射电暴及电离层扰动效应，结合e-CALLISTO和SWAVES观测进行时间关联分析。

Result: 发现太阳活动与30-40 MHz频段宽带噪声之间存在显著相关性，并观测到与NOAA报告的无线电中断一致的AERA频谱图现象。

Abstract: Solar activity events release vast amounts of energy, including radio waves,
X-rays, ultraviolet radiation, and energetic particles, which interact with the
ionosphere of the Earth and can disrupt radio wave propagation, affecting radio
communications. They can either enhance reflections, improving long-distance
terrestrial communications, or cause signal degradation and absorption,
respectively, depending on whether the increased ionization affects the upper
or lower layers of the ionosphere. In the first case, the solar cycle modulates
the Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF), the highest frequency usable for radio
communication between two Earth-based points. The Auger Engineering Radio Array
(AERA) of the Pierre Auger Observatory was developed to measure the radio
emission from extensive air showers in the $30-80$ MHz band. We examine the
impact of solar activity on AERA data collected over approximately 11 years. We
report the detection of different types of solar radio bursts and we
investigate how increased solar radiation - particularly in the X-ray and
extreme ultraviolet bands - also affects measurements in the AERA energy band.
Our results show a remarkable correlation between the MUF and the broadband
noise observed in the $30-40$ MHz frequency range. Radio blackouts are also
observed in AERA spectrograms in coincidence with those reported by the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additionally, we
performed a search for temporal coincidences between AERA data and independent
observations of solar radio burst events from the e-CALLISTO network and the
SWAVES instrument. These findings highlight the complex interplay between solar
activity and radio wave propagation, which is also relevant for cosmic-ray
detection.

Method: 采用基于似然性的系统多源搜索方法，结合threeML软件包和HAL插件进行分析。

Result: 采用基于似然的系统多源搜索方法结合三ML软件包和HAL插件分析HAWC数据，显著减少了建模所需的计算时间和资源。

Abstract: The analysis of HAWC data is done using a likeihood-based systematic
multi-source search procedure utilizing the threeML software package and the
HAL Plugin. This approach was inspired by the extended source search described
in the Fermi-LAT Extended Source Search Catalog. The pipeline to search for
point sources and extended sources within the region of interest (ROI) is
described in the recent HAWC papers. This procedure is computationally
intensive and often requires multiple days to produce a final model for a
region. Often this approach misses fainter sources, which need to be added
manually later. This blind search could be complemented by providing a method
to seed source locations, which can be assessed and evaluated by likelihood
analysis, thereby significantly reducing the computational time and resources
spent on finding a model.

Method: 通过数值模拟不稳定多行星系统的行星-行星散射过程进行分析。

Result: 行星散射导致约半数"自由漂浮"海王星质量天体实际为轨道分离的"脱离行星"。

Abstract: Microlensing surveys suggest the presence of a surprisingly large population
of free-floating planets, with a rate of about two Neptunes per star. The
origin of such objects is not known, neither do we know if they are truly
unbound or are merely orbiting at large separations from their host stars.
Here, we investigate planet-planet scattering as a possible origin through
numerical simulations of unstable multi-planet systems. We find that planet
ejection by scattering can be slow, often taking more than billions of years
for Neptune-mass scatterers orbiting at a few AU and beyond. Moreover, this
process invariably delivers planets to orbits of hundreds of AU that are
protected from further scattering. We call these ``detached" planets. Under the
scattering hypothesis, we estimate that about half of the reported
``free-floating" Neptunes are not free but merely ``detached".

Abstract: We present new observations of the PDS 70 disc obtained with the Atacama
Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) in Band 9 (671 GHz) at
0.242$^{\prime\prime}$ resolution, which provide valuable insights into the
spatial distribution of sub-millimetre grains in the disc. The data reveal a
ring-like morphology, with a radial peak located between those previously
observed at infrared wavelengths and longer millimetre observations.
Additionally, we detect a tentative outer shoulder in Band 9 that is not
observed at longer wavelengths. These findings suggest that small grains ($\sim
100 \mu$m) traced by Band 9 may be escaping from the pressure bump both
radially inwards and outwards, or may be tracing different disc layers than
those probed at longer wavelengths. A multi-wavelength analysis of the disc at
millimetre wavelengths and the best fit to the spectral energy distribution
shows the presence of centimetre grains around the ring location, where the
dust surface density also peaks, compatible with dust trap models. The grain
size in the disc cavity is not well constrained but is consistent with grains
as small as 10 $\mu$m, supporting the hypothesis that small dust grain filters
through the cavity. We use dust evolution models to demonstrate that a
turbulent viscosity of $\alpha \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ allows small grains to filter
through the disc gap, while $\alpha \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-3}$ is required to
retain large grains in the pressure bump. The Band 9 observations of PDS 70
validate theoretical models and confirm the presence of pebble flux through the
disc gap.

### [73] [Minimal Multi-Majoron Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08645)

Background: 探索中微子质量起源和宇宙学相变与拓扑缺陷的引力波信号。

Data: 使用了两个复标量Majoron场φ₁和φ₂的耦合数据，并通过额外的全局U(1)_N对称性控制其与两个右手性中微子的相互作用。

Result: 提出了一个包含两个复杂标量Majoron场的最小多Majoron模型，通过全局对称性破缺产生独特引力波谱并确定右手中微子质量尺度。

Abstract: In order to provide a natural framework for hierarchical right-handed
neutrinos, we propose a realistic ultraviolet complete minimal multi-Majoron
model (MMMM). We consider two right-handed neutrinos for simplicity, although
the model is readily extendable to more. The minimal model introduces two
complex scalar Majoron fields $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$, whose couplings to the two
respective right-handed neutrinos are controlled by an extra global $U(1)_N$
symmetry. We show that a flavon field is required to facilitate the effective
Yukawa couplings, in order to implement the type I seesaw mechanism. We analyse
the resulting phenomenology related to neutrino masses, flavour mixing and
cosmological predictions concerning the formation and decay of topological
defects like the global cosmic strings and the domain walls when the
$U(1)_N\times U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry is broken. The resulting gravitational wave
spectrum is a distinctive combination of the spectrum from the global cosmic
string and strong first-order phase transitions when the symmetries are broken,
the strength of the latter being enhanced by the second Majoron field. The
resulting characteristic spectrum determines the two right-handed neutrino mass
scales within the considered framework.

### [74] [Out of the darkness: probing the inflationary era with dark photon dark matter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08932)
*Pierluca Carenza,Tassia Ferreira,Thong T. Q. Nguyen*

**TL;DR**: 通过结合暗光子探测和宇宙学数据，首次提出一种跨学科方法直接探测暴胀时期并重建暗光子特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 探索暗光子作为暴胀时期独特信使的科学意义。

Data: 数据来源于TASEH光腔探测器的观测结果、下一代穿墙实验以及宇宙学数据（特别是张量标量比r的测量）。

Method: 采用下一代光穿墙实验结合宇宙学数据重建暗光子特性。

Result: 首次探测到暗光子暗物质可能为直接研究暴胀时期提供新途径。

Abstract: A recent hint reported by the TASEH haloscope suggests the possible detection
of dark photon dark matter with mass $19.5~{\rm \mu eV}$. Due to their
production during inflation, dark photons act as unique messengers from this
primordial epoch. We explore the implications that a confirmed detection would
have in directly probing the inflationary era for the first time. To resolve
the intrinsic degeneracy between the dark photon mixing parameter and its
fractional relic abundance introduced by haloscope measurements, we motivate a
next-generation light-shining-through-a-wall experiment. Combining these two
experiences with cosmological data, particularly measurements of the
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, we propose an interdisciplinary approach to
reconstruct dark photon properties. We delineate a coherent strategy for
simultaneously determining the dark photon kinetic coupling, abundance, and
properties of the inflationary era.

Background: 研究超对称混合暴胀模型及其预测的标量谱指数与宇宙微波背景观测的一致性。

Data: 数据来源于Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT)的测量结果以及Pulsar Timing Array (PTA)的观测数据。

Method: 采用超对称混合暴胀模型分析暴胀时期的标量扰动和引力波谱。

Result: 发现了一类现实超对称混合暴胀模型，其预测的标量谱指数ns≈0.97-0.978与ACT观测结果高度吻合。

Abstract: We explore a class of realistic supersymmetric hybrid inflation models with a
predicted scalar spectral index $n_s \approx 0.97-0.978$, which is in good
agreement with the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) measurement. The
waterfall field responsible for the gauge symmetry breaking in this scenario
experiences some $e$-foldings during the inflationary epoch. The scalar
perturbations associated with the waterfall field during this phase induce a
stochastic gravitational wave spectrum that will be tested in the ongoing
Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) measurements and in future experiments. In an $SU(5)$
setting an observable number density of the superheavy GUT monopole linked to
the waterfall field can be realized.
