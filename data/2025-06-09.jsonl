We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of\nensembles of individual spherical clouds to systematically explore under which\nconditions the cold clouds can survive. We find that cloud ensembles can\nsurvive collectively -- even when individual clouds, if isolated, would be\nrapidly destroyed. Our results indicate that, besides the morphology, factors\nsuch as tight packing, small inter-cloud distance and higher fragmentation\nfacilitate survival. We propose a novel multi-cloud survival criterion that\naccounts for collective properties of the cloud system, including total gas\nmass and the geometric configuration based on an effective volume filling\nfraction of the cold gas $F_V$. This fraction is computed by constructing a\ncomposite volume from individual enclosing conical boxes aligned with the wind,\nincorporating spatial overlap and cloud-tail spreading. The box dimensions\nscale with the critical survival radius $r_{\\rm crit}$ from the single-cloud\ncriterion. We find a universal threshold $F_{V,{\\rm crit}}\\approx 0.24$ that\nrobustly separates surviving from destroyed systems across diverse geometric\nconfigurations.

Accepted for publication\n  in A&A", "summary": "The interstellar hydride hydroxyl (OH) is a potential tracer of CO-dark\nmolecular gas. We present new absorption line observations of OH at 18-cm\nwavelength towards four continuum sources. We compare these to the [CII] line\nat 1.9 THz obtained with SOFIA, observations of the neutral atomic hydrogen 21\ncm line with the VLA, and CO lines obtained with APEX. We trace OH over a large\nrange of molecular hydrogen column densities, and derive OH abundances with\nrespect to molecular and total hydrogen column densities. Increased sensitivity\nand spectral resolution allowed us to detect weak and narrow features. We\nidentify only one OH absorption component out of 23 without CO counterpart, yet\nseveral with intermediate molecular gas fractions. A potential association of\n[CII] 158 mu m emission with an OH absorption component is seen toward one\nsightline. Our results confirm that OH absorption traces molecular gas across\ndiffuse and dense environments of the interstellar medium. At the sensitivity\nlimits of the present observations our detection of only one CO-dark molecular\ngas feature appears in agreement with previous studies. We conclude that if OH\nabsorption was to be used as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, deeper\nobservations or stronger background targets are necessary to unveil its full\npotential as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, and yet it will never be an\nexclusive tracer of CO-dark molecular gas. For OH hyperfine-splitting\ntransitions in the vicinity of photodissociation regions in W43-South, we\ndetect a spectral and spatial offset between the peak of the inversion of the\nOH 1612 MHz line and the absorption of the OH 1720 MHz line on the one hand,\nand the absorption of the OH main lines on the other hand, which provides\nadditional constraints on the interpretation of the OH 18 cm line signatures\ntypical of HII regions."}

Several scenarios have been proposed for its origin, including\nan X-ray corona, a scaled-down jet, or outflow-driven shocks, which can be\ntested via mm polarimetry. In the optically thin regime, synchrotron emission\nis expected to show polarization up to $\\sim$70\\%, but disordered magnetic\nfields and Faraday rotation reduce this to a few percent for jets and outflows,\nwhile an X-ray corona is likely to result in complete depolarization. To\ninvestigate this, we conducted the first ALMA Band 3 full-polarization\nobservations of three RQ AGN - NGC 3783, MCG 5-23-16, and NGC 4945. No\npolarized signal was detected in any of the AGN, with an upper limit of\n0.5-1.5\\%, supporting the X-ray corona scenario. However, we detected a compact\nsource with 17\\% polarization in NGC 3783, 20 pc away from the AGN, co-spatial\nwith the mm and narrow-line outflow, likely linked to a shock propagating\nthrough the outflowing material. Additionally, combining our data with archival\nALMA observations, we found typical mm variability in RQ AGN by a factor of 2;\nhowever, the sparsity of the data prevented a more detailed analysis of the\ntotal flux variability."}

Observations motivate current efforts to explain surprisingly\ncompact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions,\nhalos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the\ncentral region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse\nphase from first principles. To improve on this, we seek to better understand\nnumerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter\n(SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially we aim for a better\nunderstanding of the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we run SIDM N-body\nsimulations of a low mass halo in isolation and within an external\ngravitational potential. The simulation setup is motivated by the perturber of\nthe stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to\nenergy conservation errors, and a too large SIDM kernel size can artificially\nspeed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can\ndescribe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have\nsimulated. Furthermore, for our highest-resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we\nmake the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the\ncurrent numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late\ncollapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, e.g.\nthat the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows to\nrun simulations of halos becoming concentrated enough to explain observations\nof GD-1 like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems."}

They could be\ndifficult to explain with collisionless dark matter (DM). To explain those\nobjects, recent studies focused on the gravothermal collapse that halos\nconsisting of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can undergo. However, simple\nmodels of elastic scattering could face problems explaining those compact\nobjects during very later stages of the collapse and the post-collapse phase,\nwhere a black hole may have formed from DM. We aim to explain compact halos\nwhile avoiding the gravothermal catastrophe which typical SIDM models are\nsubject to. Therefore, we investigate the evolution of a DM halo for an SIDM\nmodel consisting of two species with unequal masses, featuring only\ninteractions between the different species but not within themselves. Employing\n$N$-body simulations, we study the effect of unequal-mass SIDM models on the\nevolution of an isolated DM halo. In particular, the late stages of its\nevolution with high central densities are simulated. We find that our\ntwo-species SIDM models can produce density cores with their size depending on\nthe mass ratio of the two species. Moreover, the mass segregation caused by the\nunequal particle masses leads to a finite final density state or at least a\nslowly growing density, which depends on the mass ratio and the mass fraction\nof the two DM species. SIDM models consisting of two DM species can\nsimultaneously explain DM halos with density cores, as well as systems that are\ndenser in their centre than expected from collisionless DM, while avoiding the\ngravothermal catastrophe. They are a compelling alternative to single-species\nmodels, offering a rich phenomenology."}
