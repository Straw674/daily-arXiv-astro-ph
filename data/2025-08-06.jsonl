In this\nwork, we analyse these observations to assess the robustness of these reported\nresults. While our analysis indicates that the data support additional angular\nstructure in the lensing mass distribution beyond an elliptical power-law\ndensity profile, we do not find evidence for two previously reported sub-halo\ndetections. However, we verify with realistic mock data that we could have\nfound evidence in favour of a previously reported $\\approx 10^{9}\\,{\\rm\nM_{\\odot}}$ sub-halo with a log Bayes factor of 29, should it exist in the real\ndata. After testing various systematics, we find that this previous sub-halo\ninference was most likely spurious and resulted from an inadequate smooth\nmodel, specifically, poorly fitting multipoles. While we do not find evidence\nin favour of any individual sub-halo, we find evidence for similarity in the\nlensing signatures of multipoles ($m=3,4$) and single massive sub-haloes,\nconsistent with other recent work. We suggest that future searches for low-mass\nhaloes in lensed arcs include lens angular structure in the form of multipoles\nup to 4th order and require a good-fitting smooth model as a prerequisite.\nOverall, our findings demonstrate the suitability of ALMA data of this quality\nto simultaneously constrain the abundance of low-mass haloes and lens angular\nstructure."}

We show that the edges of a cluster's stellar\nprofile -- the primary (Rsp*1) and secondary (Rsp*2) stellar \"splashback\" radii\n-- are sensitive to both continuous mass accretion histories and discrete\nmerger events, making them potentially powerful probes of a cluster's past. We\nfind that Rsp*1 strongly correlates with the cluster's mass ~1 dynamical time\nago, while Rsp*2 traces more recent mass accretion history to a slightly lesser\ndegree. In combination, these features can further distinguish between clusters\nthat have and have not undergone a major merger within the past dynamical time.\nWe use both to predict realistic cluster mass accretion histories with the\nMultiCAM framework. These outer ICL features are significantly more sensitive\nto mass accretion and merger histories than the stellar mass gap and halo\nconcentration, and perform comparably to the commonly used X-ray-based tracer\nof relaxedness, x_off.

We then compared the occurrence of water and methanol\nmasers across the sample. We detected 183.3 GHz water masers in 5 out of 18\nsources. IRAS 16293-2422 shows all three transitions, while Serpens FIRS 1 also\ndisplays the 321.2 GHz line. Despite excellent observing conditions, detection\nrates drop with increasing frequency, reflecting both intrinsic line weakness\nand variability. Notably, the brightest (sub)millimeter masers can reach flux\ndensities comparable to the 22 GHz line. Comparisons of velocity profiles show\nthat different transitions often trace distinct gas components. Water masers\ngenerally appear at earlier or comparable evolutionary stages than MM,\nsuggesting no universal maser-based age sequence.

Its success depends critically on obtaining\nhighly accurate mean redshifts for ensembles of galaxies $n(z)$ in all\ntomographic bins, essential for deriving robust cosmological constraints.\nHowever, photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) suffer from systematic biases\narising from various sources of uncertainty. To address these challenges, we\nutilised self-organising maps (SOMs) with mock samples resembling the Euclid\nWide Survey (EWS), to validate Euclid's uncertainty requirement of\n$|\\Delta\\langle z \\rangle| = \\langle z_{\\text{est}} \\rangle - \\langle z \\rangle\n\\leq 0.002 (1+z)$ per tomographic bin, assuming DR3-level data.

In contrast, the redshift tomography on the\nphoto-$z$s of the EWS-like sample yields superior results, with eight out of\nten bins [$0 < z\\leq 2.5$] meeting the Euclid requirement. To enhance the\nrealism of our study, we morph our calibration sample to mimic the C3R2 survey\nin incremental steps. In this context, a maximum of six out of ten bins meet\nthe requirement, strongly advocating the adoption of a redshift tomography\ndefined by the photo-$z$s of individual galaxies rather than the commonly used\nmean spec-$z$ of SOM cells.

We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin\nTransformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS\nand CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of\nincapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures\nof galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In\nparticular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain\nmeaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable\nuncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to\nthe nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images\nmay still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise\nfor downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly\nrequired. Our work can facilitate further research on how complex physical\ninformation is manifested on galaxy images, and it provides implications on the\ndevelopment of image translation models for scientific use."}

Recent observational studies found\nthat dynamically-old GCs have P1 and P2 spatially mixed due to relaxation\nprocesses. However, in dynamically-young GCs, where P2 is expected to be more\ncentrally concentrated from birth, the spatial distributions of P1 and P2 are\nsometimes very different from system to system. This suggests that more complex\ndynamical processes specific to certain GCs might have shaped those\ndistributions. We aim to investigate the discrepancies between the spatial\nconcentration of P1 and P2 stars in dynamically-young GCs. Our focus is to\nevaluate whether massive binary stars (e.g. BHs) can cause the expansion of the\nP2 stars through binary-single interactions in the core, and whether they can\nmix or even radially invert the P1 and P2 distributions. We use a set of\ntheoretical and empirical arguments to evaluate the effectiveness of\nbinary-single star scattering. We then construct a set of direct N-body models\nwith massive primordial binaries to verify our estimates further and gain more\ninsights into the dynamical processes in GCs. We find that binary-single star\nscatterings can push the central P2 stars outwards within a few relaxation\ntimes. While we do not produce radial inversion of P1 and P2 for any initial\nconditions we tested, this mechanism systematically produces clusters where P1\nand P2 look fully mixed even in projection. The mixing is enhanced 1) in denser\nGCs, 2) in GCs containing more binary stars, and 3) when the mass ratio between\nthe binary components and the cluster members is higher.

The targets\nwere selected in the SDSS Stripe 82 field based on their bright WISE W4\ndetections (flux > 5 mJy) and extremely faint or red optical counterparts\n(e.g., r > 23 or r - W4 > 8.4), designed to identify heavily obscured quasars.\nDeep near-infrared (Gemini/GNIRS) and optical (Keck/LRIS and KCWI) spectroscopy\nconfirm 23 out of 24 candidates as Type-2 quasars in this redshift range,\nincluding 12 objects at z > 2. The spectra exhibit strong rest-frame UV and\noptical emission lines (Ly-alpha, C IV, [O III], H-alpha) with a wide range of\nline widths, indicating significant spectral diversity. Approximately one-third\nof the sample (8 of 23) shows broad H-alpha emission (FWHM > 2000 km/s) despite\ntheir Type-2 classification, while the rest have only narrow lines (FWHM < 2000\nkm/s) characteristic of classical obscured quasars. Notably, these broad-line\nType-2 quasars share similar spectral energy distributions with the\nJWST-discovered \"little red dot\" (LRD) AGNs, suggesting that our sample could\nbe lower-redshift analogues of the heavily obscured broad-line AGNs uncovered\nby JWST. We also find that the [O III] 5007 angstrom emission is relatively\nweak for their high bolometric luminosities, deviating from trends seen in\nlower-redshift Type-2 QSOs. A new composite spectrum for Type-2 QSOs is built\nusing our sample. Overall, our results demonstrate that mid-IR selection\nefficiently uncovers a diverse population of obscured quasars and that\nspectroscopic follow-up is crucial for revealing their true nature. This study\nprovides new insights into heavily obscured SMBH growth at cosmic noon and\nbridges the gap to the obscured AGN populations now being revealed by JWST."}

Here, we combine dark\nmatter-only zoom-in simulations from the Symphony suite with the Nimbus\n\"star-tagging\" model of the stellar halo to assess how much information about\nthe mass assembly of an individual galaxy cluster can be gleaned from idealized\nmeasurements of ICL outskirts. We show that the edges of a cluster's stellar\nprofile -- the primary (Rsp*1) and secondary (Rsp*2) stellar \"splashback\" radii\n-- are sensitive to both continuous mass accretion histories and discrete\nmerger events, making them potentially powerful probes of a cluster's past. We\nfind that Rsp*1 strongly correlates with the cluster's mass ~1 dynamical time\nago, while Rsp*2 traces more recent mass accretion history to a slightly lesser\ndegree. In combination, these features can further distinguish between clusters\nthat have and have not undergone a major merger within the past dynamical time.\nWe use both to predict realistic cluster mass accretion histories with the\nMultiCAM framework. These outer ICL features are significantly more sensitive\nto mass accretion and merger histories than the stellar mass gap and halo\nconcentration, and perform comparably to the commonly used X-ray-based tracer\nof relaxedness, x_off. While our analysis is idealized, the relevant ICL\nfeatures are potentially detectable in next-generation deep imaging of nearby\nclusters.

Its success depends critically on obtaining\nhighly accurate mean redshifts for ensembles of galaxies $n(z)$ in all\ntomographic bins, essential for deriving robust cosmological constraints.\nHowever, photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) suffer from systematic biases\narising from various sources of uncertainty. To address these challenges, we\nutilised self-organising maps (SOMs) with mock samples resembling the Euclid\nWide Survey (EWS), to validate Euclid's uncertainty requirement of\n$|\\Delta\\langle z \\rangle| = \\langle z_{\\text{est}} \\rangle - \\langle z \\rangle\n\\leq 0.002 (1+z)$ per tomographic bin, assuming DR3-level data.

In contrast, the redshift tomography on the\nphoto-$z$s of the EWS-like sample yields superior results, with eight out of\nten bins [$0 < z\\leq 2.5$] meeting the Euclid requirement. To enhance the\nrealism of our study, we morph our calibration sample to mimic the C3R2 survey\nin incremental steps. In this context, a maximum of six out of ten bins meet\nthe requirement, strongly advocating the adoption of a redshift tomography\ndefined by the photo-$z$s of individual galaxies rather than the commonly used\nmean spec-$z$ of SOM cells.

After filtering out foreground stars on the basis of Gaia\nparallaxes we construct, for the first time, the XLF of IC 10. We then use the\nXLF to model the star formation history of the galaxy, finding that a very\nrecent (3-8 Myr) burst of star formation with rate of $\\sim$0.5 $M_{\\odot}$\nyr$^{-1}$ is needed to adequately explain the observed bright-end\n($L_X\\sim10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$) of the HMXB XLF."}

As more sources are investigated, this\ncollimation profile appears to represent a common paradigm. Previous works\nsuggest that the Bondi radius may serve as an indicator of the transition\nlocation, although discrepancies have been observed in some sources. To explore\nthis further, we selected CTA 102 for which existing literature presents mixed\nevidence regarding the presence of a jet geometry break. We investigated the\njet width profile of CTA 102 to study the possible transition changes in the\njet, thereby improving the understanding of connection between Bondi radius and\njet transition. We used multi-frequency VLBA images of CTA 102 at 2, 5, and 8\n(single epoch), and 15, 22 and 43 GHz (stacked). The jet width profile was\nmodeled with a single power law $W_{jet}\\propto r^{\\epsilon}$ yielding a\npower-law index of $\\epsilon=0.69\\pm0.02$, indicative of a quasi-parabolic\ngeometry with no clear transition to a conical regime. The absence of\ndiscernible structural break around the Bondi radius implies that the physical\nconditions associated with the radius alone are insufficient to explain the jet\ncollimation behaviour. On the other hand, we observe oscillatory features in\nthe jet width profile, suggesting the influence of additional physical\nprocesses beyond gravitational confinement. These findings contribute to a more\nnuanced understanding of jet collimation in AGN and highlight the complexity of\njet-environment interactions."}

Instead, the parallel jets emitted by the nearby YSOs VLA 3A and 3B can be\nreliably tracked with the H$_2$ emission at scales of a few 10\" to both the\nsouthwest and the northeast. In particular, northeast of VLA 3 the direction of\nthese two jets crosses a linear chain of spaced H$_2$ knots, which is a clear\nsignature of an episodic jet.

With deep learning-based generative models, image translation has\nbeen performed for image generation, data quality enhancement, information\nextraction, and generalized for other tasks such as deblending and anomaly\ndetection. However, most endeavors on image translation primarily focus on the\npixel-level and morphology-level statistics of galaxy images. There is a lack\nof discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical\ninformation, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely\non high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the\neffectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical\ninformation (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and\nmorphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin\nTransformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS\nand CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of\nincapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures\nof galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In\nparticular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain\nmeaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable\nuncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to\nthe nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images\nmay still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise\nfor downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly\nrequired.
