In this paper, we\npresent new JWST/NIRSpec and Keck/LRIS spectra of nine LAEs in the redshift z ~\n7 protocluster, LAGER-z7OD1. Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and\nLyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha\ndamping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard\ncontext of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min)\n= 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral\npatch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct\nsub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the\nnine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a\nmodest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual\nionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on\nan empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling\ngalactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred\nintergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength).

However, the small PSF\nsize provided by default pipelines suits only barely resolved objects, making\nit difficult to analyze regions near bright stars (rendering those regions\nunusable). These components are then combined to generate a final PSF for each\nexposure and filter, spanning 15 mag arcsec-2 in surface brightness and 4\narcmin in radius in the broad bands. In narrow-band filters, the J-PLUS PSF\nexhibits two rings, whereas in broad-band filters, only one ring is observed.\nAdditionally, the position of the ring shifts with filter wavelength: as the\nfilters become redder, the ring radius increases. We find that there is no\nsignificant variation in the extended PSF observed as a function of time\n(within 2.5h) or position in the field of view. The radial profile of NGC 4212\n(which is close to a star) is also studied before/after PSF-subtraction. We\ndeveloped a novel method to determine the central coordinates of saturated\nstars, and classify stars without using Gaia magnitudes. Additionally, mirror\nreflections are automatically detected and masked. Furthermore, in combining\ndifferent stars and various components of the PSF, we avoided the use of a\nfixed radius by introducing a new method that does not depend on radial\nmeasurements. Accurate characterization of the extended PSF and its subtraction\nimproves sky subtraction, increases the effective area of the survey by about\n10%, and enables the study of extended large LSB features in wide area surveys\nlike J-PLUS. Our pipeline is published as free software (GNU GPLv3) an can be\ncustomized to other surveys such as J-PAS, where its impact will be even\ngreater due to its depth.

We then discuss simple methods to populate dark matter halos with\ngalaxies, such as Halo and Sub-halo Abundance Matching techniques and\nbaryonification techniques for capturing baryonic effects on the matter\ndistribution. We finally describe how to model the gas component by solving the\nEuler-Poisson equations, focusing on the foundational assumptions behind these\nequations, namely local thermo-dynamical equilibrium, and the nature of the\ntruncation errors of the numerical scheme, namely numerical diffusion.

While the\nwidely accepted swing-amplification theory provides a qualitative framework for\ntheir formation, the detailed physical processes remain incompletely\nunderstood. Previous studies have shown that the bar formation timescale in\nisolated galaxies depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction (the\nso-called \"Fujii relation\") and linearly on disk hotness and thickness.\nHowever, the influence of dark matter halo spin on bar formation has not been\nsystematically investigated. In this work, we construct a suite of $N$-body\nmodels of disk and halo with varying disk mass fractions and amounts of random\nmotions. By introducing prograde and retrograde spins in the dark matter halo,\nwe explore how halo spin modifies the established empirical relations governing\nbar formation timescales. We find that these relations remain valid in both\nprograde and retrograde halo spin models. For rapid bar formation (short\ntimescale), the effect of halo spin is nearly negligible. In contrast, for\nmoderately slow bar formation, prograde (retrograde) halo spin tends to\naccelerate (suppress) bar onset. In cases of extremely slow bar formation, halo\nspin introduces a stronger but more stochastic influence. These trends might\narise from the exchange of angular momentum between the stellar disk and the\ndark matter halo."}

This feature\ngives rise to the MTI when the temperature gradient is aligned with the\ngravity, which occurs in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. Most previous linear\nanalyses of the MTI adopted a local, Boussinesq approach. However, the\nconduction length, which sets the characteristic length scale of the MTI, might\nbe a non-negligible fraction of the scale height in the ICM. We want to assess\nthe impact of locality assumptions on the linear physics of the MTI. Another\ngoal is to unveil the deeper connections between these global MTI modes and\ntheir MRI counterparts in accretion discs. Our third objective is to provide a\nnew benchmark against which any numerical code implementing the Braginskii heat\nflux in spherical geometry can be tested. We perform a global linear analysis\nof the MTI in a spherical stratified model of the ICM. We use a combination of\nanalytical results, corroborated by numerical results obtained with both a\npseudo-spectral solver and IDEFIX, to better explain the physics of the global\nMTI modes. We obtain scaling laws and approximate expressions for the growth\nrates of the global modes. We show that the associated functions are confined\nwithin an inner region, limited by a turning point, where the mode is allowed\nto grow. The most unstable local MTI modes correspond to the portion of the\nglobal mode localised near the turning point. This phenomenology is similar to\nthat of the global MRI modes. Finally, direct simulations successfully\nreproduce the global MTI modes and their growth rates, with errors smaller than\n1%. Overall, this study provides us with new insights on the linear theory of\nthe global MTI in the ICM, and a useful numerical test bench for any\nastrophysical fluid dynamics code embedding anisotropic heat flux."}

The evolution of star\nclusters is significantly shaped by the gas expulsion mode, with faster\nexpulsion producing greater mass loss. A broader degeneracy exists among\ninitial cluster mass, gas expulsion timescale, and formation channel\n(monolithic vs. coalescence), which manifests in both evolutionary pathways and\nblack hole production. In individual cluster simulations, slower gas expulsion\nenables progressively lower-mass clusters to retain central black holes within\nthe tidal radius. As the gas expulsion mode transitions from fast to moderate\nto slow, the fraction of high-velocity stars decreases. Variations in gas\nexpulsion mode and formation channel ultimately influence the stellar velocity\ndistribution (within the tidal radius), and thus the expansion speed, which\ngoverns both cluster mass loss and black hole retention. Slowly expanding\nclusters are more likely to retain black holes and multiple systems, making\nthem prime candidates for black hole searches with {\\it Gaia}.

In this paper, we\npresent new JWST/NIRSpec and Keck/LRIS spectra of nine LAEs in the redshift z ~\n7 protocluster, LAGER-z7OD1. Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and\nLyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha\ndamping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard\ncontext of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min)\n= 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral\npatch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct\nsub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the\nnine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a\nmodest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual\nionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on\nan empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling\ngalactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred\nintergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength). The\nerrorbars on the reddening correction allow fully overlapping bubbles, and our\nresults are consistent with accelerated reionization in the protocluster."}
