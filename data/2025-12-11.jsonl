The nebula exhibits a nested bipolar morphology, including inner and outer shells, faint outer lobes, and polar knots. Remarkably, all these components share a dynamical age of order 10,000 yr. Thermal broadening of the H alpha line relative to heavier ions implies a hydrogen temperature 3000 K to 6000 K, in contrast to the ~ 10,000 K derived from collisionally excited line diagnostics. This provides independent support for the presence of at least two distinct temperature/metallicity phases, as previously proposed to explain extreme abundance discrepancies. Photoionization models with sinusoidally varying metallicity successfully reproduce the observed nebular spectrum and morphology. A mixture of fluctuations with both extreme and moderate metallicity contrasts is required to simultaneously fit the O II and the [O III] observations. The nebular He II emission demands a hotter and more luminous central star than previously inferred, consistent with a ~ 0.58 solar mass post-AGB progenitor evolving toward a CO white dwarf. Ou 5 thus reinforces the link between close-binary nuclei and extreme abundance discrepancies, and provides a valuable benchmark for understanding how common-envelope ejections give rise to the thermal and abundance inhomogeneities observed in planetary nebulae."}

Yet, it remains unclear how feedback, through its connection to key galaxy properties, shapes the radial gas density profile in the host halo. We tackle this question using suites of the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Simba cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which span a variety of feedback models. We develop a random forest algorithm that predicts the radial gas density profile within haloes from the total halo mass and five global properties of the central galaxy: gas and stellar mass; star formation rate; mass and accretion rate of the central black hole (BH). The algorithm reproduces the simulated gas density profiles with an average accuracy of $\\sim$80-90% over the halo mass range $10^{9.5} \\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} < M_{\\rm 200c} < 10^{15} \\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ and redshift interval $0<z<4$. For the first time, we apply Sobol statistical sensitivity analysis to full cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, quantifying how each feature affects the gas density as a function of distance from the halo centre. Across all simulations and redshifts, the total halo mass and the gas mass of the central galaxy are the most strongly tied to the halo gas distribution, while stellar and BH properties are generally less informative. The exact relative importance of the different features depends on the feedback scenario and redshift. Our framework can be readily embedded in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to incorporate halo gas density profiles consistent with different hydrodynamical simulations. Our work also provides a proof of concept for constraining feedback models with future observations of galaxy properties and of the surrounding gas distribution."}

In this context, the galaxy EGSY8p7/CEERS-1019 at z=8.6 provides an excellent benchmark, given its stellar mass of $10^{9.3}M_\\odot$ and elevated N/O abundance despite its sub-solar metallicity. In this study, we present new JWST/NIRSpec observations offering the first spatially resolved spectroscopy of this galaxy, with higher sensitivity and spectral resolution than previous studies. We identify broad (FWHM=650km/s) H$β$ and [OIII] emission components whose emission is located between the two rest-frame UV clumps of the galaxy and extended over a distance of $\\sim1kpc$. The morphology and kinematics of these components indicate that the broad emission arises from outflowing gas rather than from an AGN broad-line region. The kinetic energy injection rate from stellar feedback is an order of magnitude higher than that of the outflow, while the radiation pressure rate is comparable to the outflow momentum rate. These results suggest that stellar feedback alone can drive the outflow, with radiation pressure potentially providing the required momentum transfer. We derive a low mass-loading factor ($η=0.16$) and ionizing photon escape fraction ($f_{esc}=0.021\\pm0.014$). Together with the high electron density measured ($n_e=2200cm^{-3}$), these results support the interpretation that most of the gas remains confined within the galaxy. Comparisons of diagnostic emission-line ratios with photoionization and shock models support a star-formation-driven ionization scenario, ruling out any excitation by AGN radiation. Finally, the absence of detectable Wolf-Rayet features suggests that alternative mechanisms must be considered to explain the high N/O ratio in this galaxy."}

Usually, these secular processes are studied in N-body and hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way analogues with stellar-dominated discs. In contrast, discs at high redshift are gas-rich, which may qualitatively change how secular evolution proceeds. We use the Nexus framework to construct and evolve a suite of isolated galaxies with fixed halo and disc mass but varying initial disc gas fraction, from 0% to 100%. We show that in gas-rich models, the root-mean-square change in stellar angular momentum is up to a factor of two larger than in gas-poor analogues and is accompanied by stronger radial and vertical heating, leading to enhanced radial mixing. We further dissect the role of gas in specific migration channels. For bar-driven migration, corotation resonance dragging dominates in gas-poor discs, whereas in gas-rich discs, stars more readily reach and accumulate at the outer Lindblad resonance, which acts as a barrier. The high radial mixing efficiency in gas-rich phases can flatten the stellar metallicity gradient relative to that of the initial gaseous disc within only a few orbital timescales. Together, these results imply that radial mixing in early, gas-rich discs is substantially more vigorous than in late-time, gas-poor discs, naturally producing distinct evolutionary tracks for chemically bimodal discs such as that of the Milky Way."}

The internal structure of the intracluster medium (ICM) is tightly linked to the assembly history and physical processes in groups and clusters, but the role of recent accretion in shaping these profiles has not been fully explored.\n  Aims. We investigate to what extent mass accretion accounts for the variability in ICM density and thermodynamic profiles, and what can present-day structures reveal about their formation histories.\n  Methods. We analyze a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation including gas cooling but no feedback, to isolate the effects of heating from structure formation. Median profiles of ICM quantities are introduced as a robust description of the bulk ICM. We then examine correlations between mass accretion rates or assembly indicators with the profiles of temperature, entropy, pressure, gas and dark-matter density, as well as their scatter.\n  Results. Accretion in the last dynamical time strongly lowers central gas densities, while leaving dark matter largely unaffected, producing a distinct signature in the baryon depletion function. Pressure and entropy show the clearest dependence on accretion, whereas temperature is less sensitive. The radii of steepest entropy, temperature, and pressure shift inward by $\\sim (10-20)\\%$ between high- and low-accretion subsamples. Assembly-state indicators are also related to the location of these features, and accretion correlates with the parameters of common fitting functions for density, pressure, and entropy.\n  Conclusions. Recent accretion leaves measurable imprints on the ICM structure, highlighting the potential of thermodynamic profiles as diagnostics of cluster growth history."}

Our method makes full use of the individual reads assuming an ideal detector subject to photon noise and Gaussian read noise.

Comments welcome", "summary": "The Lyman alpha (LyA) line of neutral hydrogen plays a central role in observations of star-forming galaxies. However, resonant scattering makes it difficult to directly interpret LyA signatures. Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) calculations have become the gold standard for modeling LyA, but it becomes extremely computationally expensive in optically thick environments. Workarounds, such as core-skipping to avoid repetitive low-transport scatterings, greatly increase the efficiency of MCRT simulations but introduce errors in the solutions. While core-skipping is designed to preserve emergent spectra, the internal radiation field, most importantly, the momentum imparted, is not properly preserved. On the other hand, to make analytical and numerical progress, it is often assumed that photons diffuse in both frequency and physical space. We find that these diffusion approximations break down for frequencies near the core and positions at finite optical depths. We propose a more physically-motivated definition for the core-wing transition frequency to isolate such effects. We derive new spectral distributions of internal radiation properties and compare the results with simulations. We analyze the diffusive properties of LyA photons and demonstrate anomalous spatial diffusion behavior with fat-tailed distributions. This work deepens our understanding of diffusion in resonant-line transfer and identifies areas where simulations or analytics may be failing and how these failures may be resolved."}

Cluster candidates were first detected as overdense regions in redshift space through the Finger-of-God (FoG) effect, and cluster membership was assigned using the GalWeight technique within the FoG-GalWeight methodology developed by our team. For each cluster, we derived the virial radius (R200), velocity dispersion (sigma200), and virial mass (M200) using the virial mass estimator. We identified ten VIPERS clusters spanning a mass range of 0.59 x 10^14 <= M200/(h^-1 Msun) <= 4.32 x 10^14 and velocity dispersions of 360 <= sigma200 <= 900 km s^-1. We cross-matched the VIPERS clusters with published catalogs and found at least one matching system for each cluster, offering external validation for our detections. We investigated the velocity dispersion-mass relation for these systems and obtained log(sigma200) = (2.73 +/- 0.06) + (0.36 +/- 0.18) log(M200), with an intrinsic scatter of sigma_int = 0.04 +/- 0.07. The derived relation is consistent with theoretical predictions from N-body and hydrodynamical simulations, confirming the reliability of the FoG-GalWeight methodology and the robustness of the virial mass estimator. Our findings demonstrate that the velocity dispersion can serve as a reliable and direct proxy for cluster mass, even at high redshift, without requiring additional dynamical mass modeling."}

However, spectroscopic redshifts (spec-$z$'s) constitute a biased and sparse sampling of the photometric galaxy population, which creates difficulties for the common grid-based approach for mapping color to redshift using self-organizing maps (SOMs). Instead, we utilized the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm to compress a Rubin-Roman-like $ugrizyJH$ color space into a thin and densely-sampled manifold. Crucially, the manifold varies continuously and monotonically in redshift and specific star formation rate in roughly orthogonal directions. Using $\\sim$110,000 COSMOS2020 many-band photo-$z$'s and $\\sim$15,000 spec-$z$'s as representative and non-representative samples, respectively, we trained and tested redshift estimation from a SOM (SOM-$z$) and from nearest neighbors in UMAP space (UMAP-$k$NN-$z$). Compared to SOM-$z$, UMAP-$k$NN-$z$ exhibited smaller photo-$z$ scatter and fraction of outliers for the representative training set. When training with the highly biased spec-$z$ sample, UMAP-$k$NN-$z$ maintained similar performance, but the outlier fraction for SOM-$z$ increased by nearly three times. The physically-meaningful trends across the UMAP manifold allow for accurate redshift regression even in regions of color space sparsely populated by spectroscopic objects, which comprise nearly 25% of the photometric sample. This suggests that representative, spectroscopically-anchored training sets can be produced by interpolating between spectroscopic sources at the UMAP coordinates of photometric objects, maximizing the performance of photo-$z$ algorithms."}

E.g., MOND premises dictate return to standard dynamics in the high-acceleration limit, predicting the standard value of $G$ for high-acceleration systems. This automatically ensures compliance of such theories with all the constraints on inconstancy of $G$ that emerge from the study of high-acceleration systems: geophysics, solar system, pulsars, supernovae, stellar evolution, emission of gravitational waves, etc. In MOND, constraints deduced from such phenomena have no bearing on possible $G$ variability in cosmology. My guiding motivation is to see if such theories may account for some roles of dark matter in cosmology; e.g., in accounting for the expansion history of the Universe in the matter-dominated era, by having a $G_e\\approx 2πG$ govern the later stages of the expansion, instead of invoking matter density $\\approx 2π\\times$ baryon density. Without adding degrees of freedom, or new dimensionful constants, BIMOND can be extended to a class of theories that entail what is best described as phenomenon-dependence of Newton's constant, $G$. I cannot yet present a consistent model that complies with all the observations in cosmology, including the expansion history, with all its details. Instead, I describe some examples of theories in the class that predict different values of $G_e$ in different circumstances, including one where $G$ takes its standard value for all subcosmological systems -- even if they are deep in the MOND regime. I also discuss scenarios in which $G_e\\approx G$ in the early Universe, as required by constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis, but with $G_e> G$ setting in at later times, where it can affect the expansion history during the matter-dominated era."}

Here, we extend the CWT framework to subhalo identification by adapting the CWTHF (Continuous Wavelet Transform Halo Finder) code. This extension extends the unbinding procedure, which enables the reliable identification of gravitationally bound substructures. The algorithm identifies density peaks within known halos or subhalos and segments the surrounding volume accordingly. Once a new subhalo is registered, its position is recorded to prevent duplicate detection. We validate our approach using the TNG50-2 and TNG100-1 simulations, as well as a single Friends-of-Friends (FOF) halo, by comparing the resulting CWT catalog against the reference SUBFIND catalog.

All galaxies have associated constraints on MgII lambda 2796 absorption, and a subset of 56 galaxies also have measurements of CaII lambda 3934. We compare rest-frame MgII and CaII equivalent widths with both projected distance and deprojected galactocentric distance. Across the full sample, we find no statistically significant correlation between absorption strength and azimuthal angle. Restricting to the 71 galaxies with well-determined disk orientations reveals a mild excess of strong MgII absorbers near the projected major axis, but a Kendall's tau test confirms that this trend is not statistically significant. CaII absorption, which exhibits a low covering fraction of kappa_CaII = 0.18^{+0.06}_{-0.04} within 50 kpc for W_r(3934) > 0.1 Ang, shows no measurable azimuthal dependence. To assess potential biases, we quantify the effects of projection, disk inclination, and variations in imaging quality.

Our investigation attempts to discover which DESI dataset gives a better match to the $w$CDM framework and assess the impact of spatial curvature on cosmological constraints. We find that the cosmic curvature parameter, $Ω_k$, disfavors the cosmological constant for the DR2+BBN and DR2+BBN+OHD data combinations. However, the deviation from the cosmological constant remains below the $1σ$ level, indicating a mild preference for a open universe. In contrast, when using the DR1 based combinations namely DR1+BBN and DR1+BBN+OHD-the deviation from the cosmological constant increases to approximately $1.2σ$, suggesting a slightly stronger indication of a open geometry. Also, the best-fit values of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) obtained from the DR1+BBN+OHD+PP and DR2+BBN+OHD+PP combinations within the dynamical dark energy model are consistent with the results reported by the Planck Collaboration. Our findings provide constraints on the dark energy EoS parameter $ w_{\\mathrm{}0}$, reveal a mild but notable deviation from the vacuum energy ($w = -1$) scenario at a significance level $1.8σ$ from DR2+BBN+OHD+PP and $0.5σ$ from DR1+BBN+OHD+PP, both favoring the quintessence region of dark energy. Furthermore, the key physical distance measures $D_H$, $D_V$, and $D_M$ show better consistency with our model when analyzed with the DR2 data."}

Yet, it remains unclear how feedback, through its connection to key galaxy properties, shapes the radial gas density profile in the host halo. We tackle this question using suites of the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Simba cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which span a variety of feedback models. We develop a random forest algorithm that predicts the radial gas density profile within haloes from the total halo mass and five global properties of the central galaxy: gas and stellar mass; star formation rate; mass and accretion rate of the central black hole (BH). The algorithm reproduces the simulated gas density profiles with an average accuracy of $\\sim$80-90% over the halo mass range $10^{9.5} \\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot} < M_{\\rm 200c} < 10^{15} \\, \\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ and redshift interval $0<z<4$. For the first time, we apply Sobol statistical sensitivity analysis to full cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, quantifying how each feature affects the gas density as a function of distance from the halo centre. Across all simulations and redshifts, the total halo mass and the gas mass of the central galaxy are the most strongly tied to the halo gas distribution, while stellar and BH properties are generally less informative. The exact relative importance of the different features depends on the feedback scenario and redshift. Our framework can be readily embedded in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to incorporate halo gas density profiles consistent with different hydrodynamical simulations. Our work also provides a proof of concept for constraining feedback models with future observations of galaxy properties and of the surrounding gas distribution."}

Despite this early prominence, no detailed lensing analyses have been carried out for more than fifteen years. We here study this cluster using JWST imaging obtained as part of the SLICE program, complemented by archival HST and X-ray observations. JWST data reveal ten new multiply imaged systems and enable the identification of conjugate substructures in several of the sixteen systems, significantly increasing the number of strong lensing constraints. Using these data, we construct a parametric mass model with Lenstool and extend it by explicitly incorporating the Chandra data in a combined strong lensing+X-ray fit. Our best-fit model reproduces the multiple images with an RMS of 0.4\" while simultaneously matching the X-ray data. The dark matter distribution is unimodal and centered on the brightest cluster galaxy, with a large core radius of 83+-5kpc, consistent with values reported in other strong lensing clusters. The strong lensing constraints require the inclusion of an external shear component which position angle points unambiguously towards a nearby (~1Mpc), well defined mass concentration at the same redshift in the North-West, for which we propose the naming AC114b. The spatial coverage of the XMM-Newton data encompasses the whole structure, allowing us to probe the X-ray properties of the companion cluster and the thermodynamics of AC114, providing evidence for a major merger, in line with previous signatures seen in Chandra, radio and optical spectroscopic data. Our results shed new light on the merging scenario, revealing a major merger caught in a late post-collisional phase, where AC114 is the dominant system and Ac114b has likely been stripped of its hot gas."}

Numerical violations of this domain can lead to loss of hyperbolicity, resulting in illposedness and severe numerical instabilities. It is therefore crucial for numerical schemes to preserve the invariant domain to ensure both physically meaningful solutions and robust computations. For complex systems, constructing invariant-domain-preserving (IDP) schemes is highly nontrivial and particularly challenging for high-order accurate methods. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of IDP schemes for hyperbolic and related systems, with a focus on the most popular approaches for constructing provable IDP schemes. We first give a systematic review of the fundamental approaches for establishing the IDP property in first-order accurate schemes, covering finite difference, finite volume, finite element, and residual distribution methods. Then we focus on two widely used and actively developed classes of high order IDP schemes as well as their recent developments, most of which have emerged in the past decade. The first class of methods seeks an intrinsic weak IDP property in high-order schemes and then designs polynomial limiters to enforce a strong IDP property at the points of interest. This generic approach applies to high-order finite volume and discontinuousGalerkin schemes. The second class is based on the flux limiting approaches, which originated from the flux-corrected transport method and can be adapted to a broader range of spatial discretizations, including finite difference and continuous finite element methods. In this survey, we elucidate the main ideas in the construction of IDP schemes, provide some new perspectives and insights, with extensive examples, and numerical experiments in gas dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics."}

Pre-stellar cores exhibit some of the highest levels of deuteration because their physical conditions greatly favor deuteration processes. Deuteration maps are a measure of the effectiveness of the deuteration across the core, and they are useful to study both the deuteration as well as the formation mechanism of the main species. Methanol is the simplest O-bearing complex organic molecule (COM) detected in the interstellar medium (ISM). It represents the beginning of molecular complexity in star-forming regions, thus a complete understanding of its formation and deuteration is a necessary step to understand the development of further chemical complexity. In this paper, we use single-dish observations with the IRAM 30 m telescope and state-of-the-art chemical models to investigate the deuteration of methanol towards the prototypical pre-stellar core L1544. We also compare the results of the chemical models with previous observations of deuterated methanol towards the pre-stellar cores HMM1 and L694-2. The spectra extracted from the CHD$_2$OH map show that the emission is concentrated in the center and towards the north-west of the core. Using deep observations towards the dust and the methanol peaks of the core, we derive a very large deuterium fraction for methanol ($\\sim20\\%$) towards both peaks. The comparison of our observational results with chemical models has highlighted the importance of H-abstraction processes in the formation and deuteration of methanol. Deep observations combined with state-of-the-art chemical models are of fundamental importance in understanding the development of molecular complexity in the ISM. Our analysis also shows the importance of non-LTE effects when measuring the D/H ratios in methanol."}

Using the data set that includes DESI BAO (DR2), PantheonPlus SNe Ia, H(z) measurements, and BBN and the MCMC analysis, the key cosmological and model-specific parameters are constrained. The result is compared with that of the ΛCDM model indicating that in addition to providing a viable dynamical dark energy framework, predictions for H(z) are slightly more consistent with intermediate-redshift observations. Generally, the model remains compatible with current data and offers testable deviations from ΛCDM for upcoming surveys. It is also seen that when the energy density of quantum fields in vacuum, exposed by NTHDE, is combined with the Rastall correction term to the general relativity, a plausible candidate for dynamical dark energy is obtained that mimic the current value of the dark energy density parameter reported in the ΛCDM model. The latter cannot be repeated by NTHDE alone. The study also confirms previous theoretical and observational constraints on the Rastall parameter obtained by focusing on the thermodynamics, early universe, pulsars, and the early-type galaxies."}

This motion manifests as periodic shifts in the timing between transits which may be detectable via high-precision and long-baseline transit- and occultation-timing measurements. Detecting precession and attributing it to a particular process may constrain the tidal responses of planets and point to the presence of otherwise undetected perturbers. However, over relatively short timescales, orbital decay driven by the same tidal interactions can induce transit-timing signals similar to the precession signal, and distinguishing between the two processes requires robust assessment of the model statistics. In this context, occultation observations can help distinguish the two signals, but determining the precision and scheduling of observations sufficient to meaningfully contribute can be complicated. In this study, we expand on earlier work focused on searches for tidal decay to map out simple metrics that facilitate detection of precession and how to distinguish it from tidal decay. We discuss properties for a short-period exoplanet system that can maximize the likelihood for detecting such signals and prospects for contributions from citizen-science observations."}

Understanding the physical properties and star formation histories (SFH) of high redshift systems is key to distinguish between the different proposed scenarios. We identify and analyse a sample of 2420 robust candidates at z~7-14 drawn from the ASTRODEEP-JWST dataset over ~0.2 deg^2 and model their properties with non-parametric SFHs to derive their specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar population properties. We find that the median sSFR and M/L remain roughly constant across the probed redshift range. We show that this result is robust against potential systematics unless a hidden population of dust-enshrouded starbursts, undetectable in current data, exists at these redshifts. In any case, the absence of observed high-sSFR systems at the highest redshifts suggests that any dust-free starburst phase must be short-lived. The observed sSFR evolution is in tension with most (though not all) theoretical models, making it a key quantity for discriminating among competing scenarios. The sample shows a wide range of physical conditions and galaxy classes, including systems with low sSFR and high mass-to-light ratios (M/L) up to z~10, indicative of already evolved galaxies only a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang, and different degrees of dust attenuation. We finally attempt to reconstruct the assembly histories of two sub-samples: a) the highest-M/L galaxies at z~7-8, which appear to have formed the bulk of their stars at least 500 Myr before observation, implying progenitors observable as UV-bright sources at z>20, and b) z>11 galaxies, which formed through stochastic SFH, remaining UV-faint for most of their early evolution, before undergoing recent (~50 Myr old) episodes of major growth."}

The results suggest a preference for dark energy to be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. Several recent analyses of DESI data indicate that the universe's expansion may not be accelerating in the way suggested by supernova based cosmology. Motivated by these studies, we investigated a tachyon type scalar field $φ$ as a model for dark energy, assuming an exponential potential for the field and performed parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Such a model offers solutions that have $w \\sim -1$ and are decelerating without requiring a phantom like equation of state. The present day value of the equation of state parameter is treated as a free parameter; however, for the reference model, we fix its present value to $-1$. The analysis is carried out using the latest Supernovae dataset (Pantheon+) and BAO measurements from DESI. The results show that both types of datasets consistently predict a turnaround in the equation of state, regardless of whether $w_{φ0}$ is treated as a free parameter or fixed to $-1$. The corresponding deceleration parameter also exhibits a future turnaround for both datasets when $w_{φ0}$ is free. However, in the reference model with $w_{φ0} = -1$, the deceleration parameter instead approaches $-1$ asymptotically. A model comparison using the Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria shows that the Pantheon+ dataset favors the free $w_{φ0}$ scenario, while BAO observations prefer the $w_{φ0} = -1$ case. This indicates a disagreement in the future evolution trends predicted by the two datasets within the tachyon type dark energy model."}

The four dwarf group members previously identified in SDSS have 9.06 < log(Mstar/Msun) < 9.43 and 9.42 < log(MHI/Msun) < 9.73. The two newly discovered dwarf satellites have log(Mstar/Msun) = 6.10 with log(MHI/Msun) = 8.71 and log(Mstar/Msun) = 7.07 with log(MHI/Msun) = 9.18. New Gemini optical spectra link the HI detections and their optical counterparts. The group's 3D velocity dispersion (188 km/s), mass-to-light ratio (M_L/B ~44), dynamical-to-baryonic mass ratio (Mdyn/Mbary ~ 21), size (69 kpc), and gas fraction (0.56) are all consistent with the compact dwarf groups in the TNG50 simulation. The group has a top-heavy satellite mass function that is inconsistent with predictions for LMC-sized hosts and may instead be two or more groups coming together. A Voronoi tessellation reveals the group resides in a tendril outside the intersection of two filaments. These intermediate density environments within large scale structure provide the conditions needed for groups of star forming, gas-rich dwarf galaxies to form and eventually merge.

Review of forecast constraints on dark energy and modified gravity", "categories": ["astro-ph.CO", "gr-qc"], "comment": "28 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "The Euclid mission has been designed to provide, as one of its main deliverables, information on the nature of the gravitational interaction, which determines the expansion of the Universe and the formation of structures. Thus, Euclid has the potential to test deviations from general relativity that will allow us to shed light on long-lasting problems in the standard cosmological model, $Λ$CDM. Euclid will mainly do this by using two complementary probes: weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering. In this paper we review pre-launch Euclid analyses for dark energy and modified gravity. These include forecast constraints with future Euclid data on cosmological parameters for different cosmological models, such as a time-varying dark energy component, phenomenological modifications of the perturbation sector and specific modified gravity models, with further extensions that include neutrino physics and the coupling to the electromagnetic sector through the fine-structure constant. We review the study of the impact of nonlinear clustering methods on beyond-$Λ$CDM constraints with Euclid. This is of fundamental importance to efficiently predict the large-scale clustering of matter and dark matter halos, given that we will have access to a wealth of information on scales beyond the linear regime. We inspect the extension of theoretical predictions for observable quantities in alternative cosmologies to $Λ$CDM at fully nonlinear scales by means of $N$-body simulations. We discuss the impact of relativistic corrections in extended cosmological models. Overall, this review highlights the significant potential of the Euclid mission to tightly constrain parameters of dark energy and modified gravity models, or perhaps to detect possible signatures of a $Λ$CDM failure."}

The iSTARMOD code is accompanied here with a series of calibrations of $χ$-functions, to transform the excess emission equivalent widths measured through iSTARMOD into absolute surface fluxes. The method provided with this code and the corresponding flux calibrations allows for the automatic characterization of the chromospheric activity of a large number of spectra or a large number of stars and is also very useful for mitigating the effect of activity on radial velocities in the search for exoplanets."}

Here, a simplified method is proposed to test such repeating pTDEs scenario considering a main-sequence star tidally disrupted twice. For the two flares in AT 2020vdq if related to the repeating pTDEs scenario, theoretical TDE model determined stellar mass of the original star disrupted for the first flare should be not very different from the mass of the star (to trace the reminder of the original star) disrupted for the second flare, because a partial TDE with impact parameter $β$ smaller than 1 can lead to most of (probable higher than 90\\%) the stellar mass also bound to the reminder of the original star. After considering theoretical TDE model applied to describe the two flares in AT 2020vdq, the model determined stellar masses are about 2${\\rm M_\\odot}$ and $0.36{\\rm M_\\odot}$ for the stars disrupted in the first flare and the second flare. The large mass difference cannot be reasonably expected by the repeating pTDEs with $β$ around 0.6 in AT 2020vdq. The results in this manuscript indicate that the repeating pTDEs scenario is not preferred at current stage in AT 2020vdq, but the probable double TDEs for two individual stars tidally disrupted should be currently recommended."}

We present a complete framework for producing high-fidelity deblended radio catalogs from the confused MIGHTEE maps using the probabilistic deblending framework XID+ and prior positions from deep multi-wavelength data in the COSMOS field. To assess performance, we construct MIGHTEE-like simulations based on the Tiered Radio Extragalactic Continuum Simulation (T-RECS) radio source population, ensuring a realistic distribution of star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) for validation. Through these simulations, we show that prior catalog purity is the dominant factor controlling deblending accuracy: a high-purity prior, containing only sources with a high likelihood of radio detection, recovers accurate flux densities and reproduces input source counts down to $\\sim 3σ$ (where $σ= $ thermal noise). On the other hand, a complete prior overestimates the source counts due to spurious detections. Our optimal strategy combines the high-purity prior with a mask that removes sources detected above $50~μ$Jy. Applied to the $\\sim$1.3\\,deg$^2$ area of the MIGHTEE-COSMOS field defined by overlapping multi-wavelength data, this procedure yields a deblended catalog of 89,562 sources.

Second, we carry out a systematic comparison of topological descriptors, as well as powerspectrum and bispectrum measurements, evaluating their constraining power on both local and equilateral $f_{\\rm NL}$ and how this sensitivity varies with halo mass. This dataset enables likelihood-free neural regression of $f_{\\rm NL}$ across multiple halo mass bins for a wide range of summary statistics. Third, we assess the transferability of these learned mappings by testing whether models trained on fast pmwd simulations can robustly infer on simulations from the QuijotePNG suite. We find that a combination of simple descriptive statistics of the topological features (PD-statistics) leads to the best performance to constrain equilateral PNG. We observe that the constraining power of these summaries comes from large-mass halos, with small-mass halos adding noise and degrading performance. Similarly, we find that the transferability of the learned mappings, for both topological and powerspectrum plus bispectrum, degrades if small scales or small-mass halos are included."}

On the other hand, such models offer greater flexibility to probe the DE sector in more detail. With the rapid advancement of astronomical surveys and the availability of diverse datasets, it is timely to examine whether current combined observations can effectively constrain an extended parameter space in DE models. This article investigates a four-parameter dynamical dark energy (DDE) model that spans a broad region of the universe's expansion history through four key parameters: the present-day value of the DE equation of state ($w_0$), its initial value ($w_m$), the scale factor depicting transition from $w_m$ to $w_0$ occurs ($a_t$), and the steepness of this transition ($Δ_{\\rm de}$). We constrain the model using CMB data from Planck, BAO from DESI DR2, and three distinct compilations of Type Ia Supernovae: PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3. Our results show that constraining all four parameters remains difficult: $a_t$ is not constrained by any dataset, while the remaining three parameters can be constrained only when all observational probes are combined (with the exception of DESY5). The results further show that DE has a quintessential nature at present ($w_0 > -1$), while $w_m$ is negative, indicating a phantom-like behaviour at early times. Interestingly, despite its larger parameter space, the proposed DDE model is preferred over the $Λ$CDM scenario, based on both $Δχ^2$ and Bayesian evidence, for certain combined datasets, particularly CMB+BAO+DESY5 and CMB+BAO+Union3."}

As a result, any source fluctuation near the black hole creates multiple lagged images on an observer's screen. For optically thin stochastic emission, these light echoes give rise to correlations of brightness fluctuations across time-dependent images (movies). The correlation pattern disentangles source-specific characteristics from universal features dictated by general relativity. This picture has motivated a proposal to use the two-point image correlation function as a probe of extreme gravitational lensing in upcoming black-hole imaging campaigns. In this work, we test the feasibility of this method by computing the two-point correlation function of brightness fluctuations in a black-hole movie of state-of-the-art realism. The movie is generated by ray tracing a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation, which can then be blurred to any angular resolution. At an effective resolution expected to be achieved by next-generation terrestrial very-long-baseline interferometric arrays, the lensing signatures appear in neither time-averaged images nor light-curve autocorrelations. However, we demonstrate that they are clearly visible in the more fine-grained two-point image correlation function. Our positive findings motivate a more comprehensive investigation into the instrument specifications and inference techniques needed to resolve extreme lensing effects through correlations."}

Our results reveal the higher concentration in the cluster centeris associated with the sharper truncation at the periphery of cluster, which is consistent with previous findings for globular clusters(GCs). We further find the systematic increase of the lower limit of clusters' half-mass radius (Rh) with age. Our results also show that OCs located at larger vertical distances from the Galactic plane systematically display higher central concentrations. Our findings collectively suggest that the structural characteristics of OCs are shaped by both intrinsic evolutionary processes and interactions with the Galactic environment. During the evolution of star clusters, the combined effects of mass segregation and tidal stripping lead to the systematic pattern between central concentration and outer truncation. Clusters of different ages and locations within the Milky Way undergo different evolutionary histories, resulting in correlations between the Rh and age, as well as between central concentration and galactic location."}

We show that these simulations reproduce a wide range of observational constraints. We also compare our simulations with previous predictions based on dark matter-only simulations which generally model the secondary anisotropies independently from one another, concluding that our hydrodynamical simulation mocks perform at least as well as previous mocks in matching the observations whilst retaining self-consistency in the predictions of the different components. Using the model variations in FLAMINGO, we further explore how the signals depend on cosmology and feedback modelling, and we predict cross-correlations between some of the signals that differ significantly from those in previous mocks.

We investigate the role of filaments in high-mass star formation, whether gas flows from large to small scales along them, and what their properties might reveal about the region they are found in. Methods. The Max Planck IRAM Observatory Program (MIOP), the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE), includes high spatial resolution (~3'') data of HCO+(1-0) and H13CO+(1-0) emission in the star-forming DR20 region in the Cygnus X complex. In this data we identify filaments with the structure identification algorithm DisPerSE. We further analyze these filaments using Gaussian fits to the spectra to determine the line peak velocity and full width half maximum along them. The Python package FilChaP was used to determine filament widths. Results. We find projected velocity gradients inside several filaments between 0.4 to 2.4km/s over projected length-scales of 0.1pc toward star-forming cores. This can be interpreted as a sign of gas flowing along the filaments toward the cores. The filament width distributions exhibit median values between 0.06 and 0.14pc depending on the core, the tracer, and the method. Standard deviations are approximately 0.02 to 0.06pc. These values are roughly in agreement with the filament width of 0.1pc typically found in nearby low-mass star-forming regions. Conclusions. This first analysis of filamentary properties within the Cygnus X CASCADE program reveals potential signatures of gas flows along filaments onto star-forming cores. Furthermore, the characteristics of the filaments in this high-mass star-forming region can be compared to those of filaments in low-mass star-forming regions typically studied before. Extending such studies to the entire CASCADE survey will enhance our knowledge of high-mass filament properties on solid statistical grounds."}

For the first time, we apply Sobol statistical sensitivity analysis to full cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, quantifying how each feature affects the gas density as a function of distance from the halo centre. Across all simulations and redshifts, the total halo mass and the gas mass of the central galaxy are the most strongly tied to the halo gas distribution, while stellar and BH properties are generally less informative. The exact relative importance of the different features depends on the feedback scenario and redshift. Our framework can be readily embedded in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to incorporate halo gas density profiles consistent with different hydrodynamical simulations. Our work also provides a proof of concept for constraining feedback models with future observations of galaxy properties and of the surrounding gas distribution."}

A Statistical Analysis of MHD Simulations", "categories": ["astro-ph.GA"], "comment": null, "summary": "Dense cores, the progenitors of stars, are in sub-pc scale and fragmented from pc-scale clumps. However, it is still unclear that how strongly the fragmentation process is affected by the properties of the host clumps, and how these properties influence the core distribution observed in recent millimeter (mm) and sub-mm observations. To systematically investigate this relation, we employed MHD simulations of convergent flows to generate a large sample of clumps and analyzed their properties using various techniques. Alignment parameters were used to quantify core distribution, while energy terms were calculated to assess the influence of gravity, magnetic fields, and turbulence. We found the core distribution only exhibiting weak correlations between alignment parameters and clump properties. For an individual clump, turbulence is believed to significantly contribute to these features by inducing non-homologous collapse and ongoing fragmentation. Nevertheless, for the entire population, more compact core distributions are observed due to the dominance of gravity. Overall, these factors suggest that clump properties are not sufficient to accurately determine core distribution."}

In standard single-field hilltop inflation, the inflaton must start extremely close to the maximum of the potential, raising concerns about the naturalness of the initial conditions. We demonstrate that the curvaton field not only solves the initial-value problem, but also opens up parameter space through modifying the curvature perturbation power spectrum, reviving the cubic and quartic hilltop inflation models in the sub-Planckian regime. We find viable parameter space consistent with the recent cosmological observations, and predict a sizable tensor-to-scalar ratio that can be tested in the next-generation Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments."}

Previous studies suggest that disc-dominated emission becomes more prominent with increasing optical luminosity. However, the redshift evolution of this relation remains debated, and a dependence on Eddington ratio, predicted by accretion flow models, is still observationally unconstrained. We revisit this relation using a large, nearly all-sky sample by combining the SDSS DR16Q QSO catalogue with X-ray data from XMM-Newton and the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey DR1, yielding 136,745 QSOs at redshifts $0.5 \\leq z < 3.0$. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian framework that treats X-ray detections and upper limits uniformly, enabling robust inference from both parametric and non-parametric models. We confirm a tight, sublinear $\\log L_X({\\rm 2\\,keV})$-$\\log L_ν({\\rm 2500\\,\\mathring{A}})$ correlation, but with a normalization at the lower end of previous estimates. Contrary to most literature results, we detect a mild but systematic redshift evolution: the relation flattens and its intrinsic scatter decreases at higher redshift. This trend is consistent with disc emission increasingly dominated by scattering and enhanced energy transfer to the X-ray corona, potentially indicating redshift evolution in the X-ray bolometric correction. We find no significant dependence on Eddington ratio, in tension with recent accretion flow models."}

Our spectroscopic targets were selected from three photometric surveys: NGVS, DES, and Pan-STARRS1. We derive center-of-mass radial velocities with uncertainties of 6 to 35 km s^-1. The halo velocity dispersion measured from our sample is 70 plus/minus 7 km s^-1. The velocity field shows a possible dipole-like structure, with redshifted northern and blueshifted southern hemispheres. Fitting a Milky Way - Large Magellanic Cloud dipole perturbation model yields a weak or marginal dipole signal with amplitude -30 (+16, -20) km s^-1 and apex direction (l, b) = (-38.2 (+42.4, -31.5), -41.3 (+27.9, -23.8)) deg, along with a bulk compression velocity of -16 plus/minus 11 km s^-1. Although limited by sky coverage and sample size, our results are consistent with the presence of LMC-induced disequilibrium in the distant halo beyond 100 kpc. In addition to the 55 RR Lyrae stars, our spectroscopy reveals that 10 additional photometrically selected RR Lyrae candidates are actually quasar or blazar contaminants, highlighting the need for caution regarding such contaminants in sparsely sampled photometric surveys. Our study demonstrates that single-epoch spectroscopy of RR Lyrae stars is a viable method for probing the kinematics of the outer halo, and future surveys such as Rubin LSST and DESI-II have the potential to significantly advance this effort."}

Critically, the lack of X-ray Integral Field Units currently limits our ability to acquire spatially resolved velocity information in the X-ray regime. However, instead, this can be achieved using the James Webb Space Telescope. As part of an ongoing investigation of the nuclear feedback processes in the nearby luminous AGN NGC 7469, we present an analysis of the kinematics of the X-ray emitting outflows using near-infrared footprint lines such as [Mg VIII] 3.03 um. These high-ionization emission lines are associated with the same gas analyzed in the X-ray, and thus can be used to probe the footprint of the X-ray wind's velocity structure and ionization state. Thanks to the wide wavelength range available with JWST we also use nebular (e.g. [S IV] 10.51 um) and coronal (e.g. [Ne V] 14.32 um) emission lines to offer a comprehensive multi-phase view of the outflows. We present mass and kinetic energy outflow rates, and find that while the feedback processes in NGC 7469 are not efficient by theoretical benchmarks, the most massive and energetic component is the high ionization X-ray gas."}

Here, we extend the CWT framework to subhalo identification by adapting the CWTHF (Continuous Wavelet Transform Halo Finder) code. This extension extends the unbinding procedure, which enables the reliable identification of gravitationally bound substructures. The algorithm identifies density peaks within known halos or subhalos and segments the surrounding volume accordingly. Once a new subhalo is registered, its position is recorded to prevent duplicate detection. We validate our approach using the TNG50-2 and TNG100-1 simulations, as well as a single Friends-of-Friends (FOF) halo, by comparing the resulting CWT catalog against the reference SUBFIND catalog.

NGC 1266 is an excellent case study for investigating the outflows and star formation quenching because it is a nearby (D\\sim30 Mpc) AGN host galaxy with an outflow driving shocks through the interstellar medium (ISM) and has recently quenched its star formation outside the nucleus. While previous works have studied the molecular outflow from its CO emission, to fully characterize the impact the outflow has on the ISM observations probing the dense, cold gas are necessary. Our ALMA cycle 0 observations do not detect a molecular outflow in 13CO(2-1) and yield a lower limit 12CO/13CO \\geq 250, suggesting a highly optically thin CO outflow with low 13CO abundance. In contrast, we detect substantial HCN(1-0) emission in the outflow, with an HCN(1-0)/12CO(1-0) ratio of 0.09, consistent with global measurements of many star-forming galaxies and Luminous InfraRed Galaxies (LIRGs). We conclude that the CO emission traces a diffuse component of the molecular gas with a low optical depth, whereas the HCN(1-0) traces dense clumps of gas entrained in the outflow. We measure an upper limit molecular outflow rate of < 85 Msun/yr. Assuming the ongoing nuclear star formation and outflow continue at the same rates, NGC 1266 will deplete its gas reservoirs in 450 Myr or longer, indicating that relatively low-level AGN feedback is capable of gradually expelling the molecular gas reservoir after a rapid quenching event."}

The internal structure of the intracluster medium (ICM) is tightly linked to the assembly history and physical processes in groups and clusters, but the role of recent accretion in shaping these profiles has not been fully explored.\n  Aims. We investigate to what extent mass accretion accounts for the variability in ICM density and thermodynamic profiles, and what can present-day structures reveal about their formation histories.\n  Methods. We analyze a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation including gas cooling but no feedback, to isolate the effects of heating from structure formation. Median profiles of ICM quantities are introduced as a robust description of the bulk ICM. We then examine correlations between mass accretion rates or assembly indicators with the profiles of temperature, entropy, pressure, gas and dark-matter density, as well as their scatter.\n  Results. Accretion in the last dynamical time strongly lowers central gas densities, while leaving dark matter largely unaffected, producing a distinct signature in the baryon depletion function. Pressure and entropy show the clearest dependence on accretion, whereas temperature is less sensitive. The radii of steepest entropy, temperature, and pressure shift inward by $\\sim (10-20)\\%$ between high- and low-accretion subsamples. Assembly-state indicators are also related to the location of these features, and accretion correlates with the parameters of common fitting functions for density, pressure, and entropy.\n  Conclusions.

Our calculations show that, compared to the Kerr model, the charge parameter $Q$ and the spin parameter $a$ significantly modify the strong gravitational field and shift the characteristic frequencies. We then model the dynamical structure formed by matter accreting toward the EEH black hole through the BHL mechanism, finding that the parameter $Q$ increases the amount of infalling matter and strengthens shock-cone instabilities near the horizon, while farther from the black hole it suppresses accretion and reduces turbulence. Time-series analysis of the accretion rate reveals robust QPOs, whose low-frequency components arise from the precession of the shock cone, while high-frequency components appear as a consequence of strong-field instabilities modified by $Q$ and $a$. A systematic parameter-space exploration identifies the regions where EEH corrections maximize QPO activity, indicating that nonlinear electrodynamics can leave observable imprints on accretion flows and may be testable with QPO and horizon-scale observations."}

Considering case (ii), using JWST and MUSE data, we derive the host galaxy morphology, stellar mass, estimate the atomic gas (HI+He) contribution, and the host rotation curve. Assuming an NFW halo and applying Bayesian inference, we obtain a mass model for the host galaxy. From this model, we compute the time required for a disk-formed BNS, with a given natal kick, to reach the observed offset while marginalizing over uncertainties and over the initial position in the disk.

The technique is fully empirical and does not depend on stellar atmosphere models.\n  The goal of the work is to test the precision of distance determinations to individual RR Lyrae stars and to their host system as a whole using the IRSB technique for a relatively distant globular cluster M 3 (NGC 5272). We also aim to determine mean radii and period-radius relations for these stars in order to compare them with the existing theoretical prediction and empirical estimations for the field stars from the solar neighborhood.\n  We use data available in the literature and the calibration of the IRSB technique based on the RR Lyrae stars from the solar neighborhood we published previously in order to determine distances to 14 RR Lyrae stars in the globular cluster M 3. We study the impact of the selection of the fitting procedure (bisector v.s. the LS fit) on the results. We apply five different empirical surface brightness-color relations from the literature in the analysis.\n  We obtained a mean distance to M 3 of $r_{M3} = (10.07 \\pm 0.19 \\pm 0.29) \\,kpc$ that corresponds to a distance modulus $μ_{M3} = (15.015 \\pm 0.041 \\pm 0.063) \\,mag$ and a $7\\%$ scatter of individual stellar distances for 14 RR Lyrae stars in M 3. We received a very good agreement between the two fitting techniques. We also determined mean stellar radii for pulsators from the sample with a precision of $0.5\\%$ and obtained excellent agreement with a theoretical prediction of the period-radius relation for RRab stars available in the literature."}

In each case, the planetary nature was revealed through distinct types of anomalies in the lensing light curves: a positive bump near the peak for KMT-2024-BLG-0176, an asymmetric peak for KMT-2024-BLG-0349, a short-duration central dip for KMT-2024-BLG-1870, and a caustic-crossing feature for KMT-2024-BLG-2087. Detailed modeling of the light curves confirms that these anomalies are produced by planetary companions with planet-to-host mass ratios in the range of $(1.5\\text{--}17.9)\\times 10^{-3}$. Despite the diversity of signal morphologies, all planets detected in these events are giant planets with masses comparable to or exceeding that of Jupiter in the Solar System. Each planet orbits a host star less massive than the Sun, emphasizing the strength of microlensing in uncovering planetary systems around low-mass stellar hosts."}

E.g., MOND premises dictate return to standard dynamics in the high-acceleration limit, predicting the standard value of $G$ for high-acceleration systems. This automatically ensures compliance of such theories with all the constraints on inconstancy of $G$ that emerge from the study of high-acceleration systems: geophysics, solar system, pulsars, supernovae, stellar evolution, emission of gravitational waves, etc. In MOND, constraints deduced from such phenomena have no bearing on possible $G$ variability in cosmology. My guiding motivation is to see if such theories may account for some roles of dark matter in cosmology; e.g., in accounting for the expansion history of the Universe in the matter-dominated era, by having a $G_e\\approx 2πG$ govern the later stages of the expansion, instead of invoking matter density $\\approx 2π\\times$ baryon density. Without adding degrees of freedom, or new dimensionful constants, BIMOND can be extended to a class of theories that entail what is best described as phenomenon-dependence of Newton's constant, $G$. I cannot yet present a consistent model that complies with all the observations in cosmology, including the expansion history, with all its details. Instead, I describe some examples of theories in the class that predict different values of $G_e$ in different circumstances, including one where $G$ takes its standard value for all subcosmological systems -- even if they are deep in the MOND regime. I also discuss scenarios in which $G_e\\approx G$ in the early Universe, as required by constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis, but with $G_e> G$ setting in at later times, where it can affect the expansion history during the matter-dominated era."}

Accepted by Astronomy and Astrophysics", "summary": "An extensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up campaign of the Type IIb SN 2022ngb is presented in the article. Through detailed modeling of this dataset, we aim to constrain the key physical parameters of the explosion, infer the nature of the progenitor star and its environment, and probe the dynamical properties of the ejecta. We analyze photometric and spectroscopic data of SN 2022ngb. By constructing and modeling the bolometric light curve with semi-analytic models, we estimate the primary explosion parameters. The spectroscopic data are compared with those of well-studied SNe IIb and NLTE models to constrain the properties of the progenitor and the structure of the resulting ejecta. SN 2022ngb is a low-luminosity SN IIb with a peak bolometric luminosity of L_bol = 7.76 (+1.15/-1.00) x 10^41 erg/s and a V-band rising time of 24.32 +/- 0.50 days. Light curve modeling indicates an ejecta mass of ~2.9-3.2 M_sun, an explosion energy of ~1.4 x 10^51 erg, and a low synthesized 56Ni mass of ~0.045 M_sun. Nebular phase spectra exhibit asymmetric line profiles, pointing to a non-spherical explosion and an anisotropic distribution of radioactive material. Our analysis reveals a relatively compact stripped-envelope progenitor with a pre-SN mass of approximately 4.7 M_sun (corresponding to a 15-16 M_sun ZAMS star). Our analysis suggests that SN 2022ngb originated from the explosion of a moderate-mass relatively compact, stripped-envelope star in a binary system. The asymmetries inferred from the nebular phase spectral line features suggest a non-spherical explosion."}

Despite its status, asteroseismic analyses of its members are rare. In particular, the gravity-mode (g-mode) pulsators, which allow inference of stellar near-core properties have not been analysed yet. We aim to identify and analyse the population of g-mode pulsators in the Pleiades. Our focus lies on the internal rotation as measured from asteroseismology to obtain a well defined sample of stellar rotation on the early main sequence. Based on full-frame images from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we constructed light curves for intermediate-mass Pleiades members and searched for g-mode pulsators among them. For pulsators exhibiting period spacing patterns, we determined their near-core rotation rate and buoyancy periods. For all other g-mode pulsators, we estimated the near-core rotation rate based on the dominant mode frequency to obtain a comprehensive rotation rate distribution. Among our 105 target stars, we find 28 g-mode pulsators distributed across the entire upper main sequence, 19 of which are hybrid pulsators, but only three stars exhibit period spacing patterns in the current TESS data. The near-core rotation rates in A- and early F-type members are distributed between 1 and 3 d$^{-1}$ without any clear mass-dependence. This distribution is much broader than the one in the similar open cluster NGC 2516. A comparison of the buoyancy periods shows that the Pleiades and NGC 2516 are of similar asteroseismic age. With the large population of g-mode and hybrid pulsators, the Pleiades constitute a valuable asteroseismic benchmark cluster, reaffirming its important role in stellar astrophysics."}

Using a parameter scan and phenomenological analysis of maximally-simplified three-dimensional cartesian magnetohydrodynamic simulations of large-scale nonlinear helical turbulent dynamos, I present results in this Letter that strongly point to an asymptotic ultimate regime of the large-scale solar dynamo, at large magnetic Reynolds numbers $Rm$, involving helicity fluxes between hemispheres. I obtained corresponding numerical solutions at both $Pm>1$ and $Pm<1$, and show that they can currently only be achieved in clean, simplified numerical setups. The analysis further strongly suggests that all global simulations to date lie in a non-asymptotic turbulent MHD regimes highly sensitive to changes in kinetic and magnetic Reynolds numbers. Ideas are presented to attempt to reach this ultimate regime in such \"realistic\" global spherical models at a reasonable numerical cost. Overall, the results clarify the current state, and some hard limitations of the brute-force numerical modelling approach applied to this, and other similar astrophysical turbulence problems."}

Recently, identification of fast-moving stars in the core of $ω$ Cen provided the strongest evidence to date for the presence of such an IMBH. One of the key questions in the study of IMBHs is their accretion efficiency, which determines their radio and X-ray signatures. We investigate the accretion signature of the IMBH in $ω$ Cen with ultra-deep radio continuum observations of the central region of the cluster. Using approximately 170 hours of Australia Telescope Compact Array observations, we achieve a root mean square noise of 1.1 $μ$Jy at 7.25 GHz, making this the most sensitive radio image of the cluster to date. We detect no radio emission at any of the proposed centers of the cluster, imposing stringent constraints on the presence of an accreting IMBH in $ω$ Cen. Considering the fundamental plane of black hole activity, our findings indicate that the accretion efficiency around the black hole is exceptionally low (with a conservative 3-$σ$ upper limit of $ε\\lesssim 4\\times10^{-3}$)."}

Author accepted manuscript of an article published in Science Advances", "summary": "A key question in astronomy is how ubiquitous Earth-like rocky planets are. The formation of terrestrial planets in our solar system was strongly influenced by the radioactive decay heat of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs), particularly $^{26}$Al, likely delivered from nearby supernovae. However, current models struggle to reproduce the abundance of SLRs inferred from meteorite analysis without destroying the protosolar disk. We propose the `immersion' mechanism, where cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis in a supernova shockwave reproduces estimated SLR abundances at a supernova distance ($\\sim$1 pc), preserving the disk. We estimate that solar-mass stars in star clusters typically experience at least one such supernova within 1 pc, supporting the feasibility of this scenario. This suggests solar-system-like SLR abundances and terrestrial planet formation are more common than previously thought."}

Because magnetic diffusion is usually much faster than system evolution, ancient fields cannot explain the present magnetization of planets, stars, and galaxies. Instead, self-sustaining dynamos, which convert fluid motion into magnetic energy, offer the most robust explanation. Numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations are essential to understanding this phenomenon. This thesis uses numerical models of self-excited dynamos in two contexts: the interstellar medium (ISM) and the interiors of gas giant planets. First, I use 3D MHD simulations with the Pencil Code to study magnetic growth from irrotational, subsonic expansion flows, a simplified representation of supernova-driven motions in the ISM. These curl-free flows mimic stellar explosions and winds, drive turbulence, and seed magnetic amplification. The second part examines planetary dynamos. I outline the properties of planetary magnetic fields and their modeling through convection in spherical shells. Although many exoplanets are known, their magnetic fields remain difficult to detect, but may be observable through coherent radio emission with new low-frequency instruments. Using 3D dynamo simulations with the MagIC code, coupled to thermodynamic profiles from MESA-based evolution models, I study the magnetic evolution of cold gas giants. The models show a slow decline in field strength, a shift from multipolar to dipolar states, and clear evolutionary trends in dynamo behavior. I also investigate hot Jupiters, where strong irradiation alters convection and rotation. Most remain fast rotators, but massive, distant planets may enter different regimes. When heating is concentrated in outer layers, convection in the dynamo region weakens, reducing expected field strengths and helping explain the absence of confirmed detections in past radio surveys."}

Starting from lightcone-based HEALPix maps and catalogues, we present a new set of mock CMB maps constructed in a self-consistent manner from the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, including CMB lensing, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects, cosmic infrared background, radio point source and anisotropic screening maps. We show that these simulations reproduce a wide range of observational constraints. We also compare our simulations with previous predictions based on dark matter-only simulations which generally model the secondary anisotropies independently from one another, concluding that our hydrodynamical simulation mocks perform at least as well as previous mocks in matching the observations whilst retaining self-consistency in the predictions of the different components. Using the model variations in FLAMINGO, we further explore how the signals depend on cosmology and feedback modelling, and we predict cross-correlations between some of the signals that differ significantly from those in previous mocks. The mock CMB maps should provide a valuable resource for exploring correlations between different secondary anisotropies and other large-scale structure tracers, and can be applied to forecasts for upcoming surveys."}
