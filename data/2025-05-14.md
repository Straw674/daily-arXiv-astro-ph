**TL;DR**: 通过深度观测和模拟分析，研究发现高红移棒旋星系中的非圆周气体流动由中央棒驱动，可能对恒星形成高峰期星系演化起重要作用。

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域关注高红移星系中气体动力学及其对星系演化的影响，但关于棒旋星系中非圆周气体流动的详细观测和解释仍不足。

Data: 使用IRAM-NOEMA干涉仪对红移约1.52的棒旋星系进行了50小时的深度CO(3-2)观测。

Method: 通过旋转盘的前向建模拟合主轴运动学，并利用高分辨率模拟（AREPO和TNG子网格模型）进行比较分析。

Result: 观测到的非圆周气体流动可解释为由中央棒驱动的径向流动，推断净流入率与恒星形成率相当，表明棒旋星系在恒星形成高峰期可能通过快速气体流入驱动演化。

Abstract: We present a very deep CO(3-2) observation of a massive, gas-rich, main
sequence, barred spiral galaxy at $z\approx1.52$. Our data were taken with the
IRAM-NOEMA interferometer for a 12-antenna equivalent on-source integration
time of $\sim$ 50 hours. We fit the major axis kinematics using forward
modelling of a rotating disk, and then subtract the two-dimensional beam
convolved best-fit model revealing signatures of planar non-circular motions in
the residuals. The inferred in-plane radial velocities are remarkably large, of
the order of $\approx60$ km/s. Direct comparisons with a high-resolution,
simulated, gas-rich, barred galaxy, obtained with the moving mesh code AREPO
and the TNG sub-grid model, show that the observed non-circular gas flows can
be explained as radial flows driven by the central bar, with an inferred net
inflow rate of the order of the SFR. Given the recent evidence for a
higher-than-expected fraction of barred disk galaxies at cosmic noon, our
results suggest that rapid gas inflows due to bars could be important
evolutionary drivers for the dominant population of star-forming galaxies at
the peak epoch of star and galaxy formation.

### [2] [Lyman-Break Galaxies in the Mpc-Scale Environments Around Three $z\sim7.5$ Quasars With JWST Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07932)

**TL;DR**: 研究三个红移z≥7.5的高光度类星体的Mpc尺度环境，揭示其与大尺度结构的联系，并通过JWST观测发现其周围存在星系过密度现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 宇宙学模拟表明，这些早期的超大质量黑洞（SMBHs）预计形成于最巨大的暗物质晕中，因此它们可能是星系过密区的锚点，前提是可见物质能反映宇宙的暗物质结构。

Data: 使用JWST NIRCam（F090W/F115W/F250M/F360M/F430M）成像数据，观测了三个类星体周围约13共动Mpc的大尺度结构。

Method: 通过选择F090W-dropout Lyman Break星系（LBGs）和F430M-excess [OIII]发射体，分析了三个类星体区域的星系过密度。

Result: 在J0313、J1342和J1007的区域内分别发现了18、21和6个LBG候选体，显示出不同程度的过密度（1+δ∼19、24和7），并证实了这些星系与类星体周围的大尺度结构相关。

Abstract: We study the Mpc-scale environments of the three highest redshift luminous
quasars at $z\geq 7.5$ (J031343.84-180636.40, J134208.11+092838.61, and
J100758.27+211529.21) to understand their connection to large-scale structure.
Cosmological simulations show that these early supermassive black holes (SMBHs)
are expected to form in the most massive dark matter halos. Therefore, it is
expected that they are anchors of galaxy overdensities if luminous matter
traces the underlying dark matter structure of the Universe. Using JWST NIRCam
(F090W/F115W/F250M/F360M/F430M) imaging, we observe the large-scale structure
out to $\sim13$ comoving Mpc around these quasars. We select F090W-dropout
Lyman Break galaxies (LBGs) and F430M-excess [OIII] emitters in the three
fields. We find 18, 21, and 6 LBG candidates in the fields of J0313, J1342, and
J1007, respectively, resulting in a wide range of overdensities ($1+\delta \sim
19,\,24,$ and $7$). The photometric redshifts indicate serendipitous foreground
and background overdensities in the J0313 field. The joint angular
autocorrelation of the combined LBG sample shows significant clustering on
$<1.8$ comoving Mpc scales, demonstrating that the selected galaxies are likely
associated with the large-scale structure surrounding the quasars. This first
systematic study of $z\sim 7.5$ quasars shows a diverse set of quasar
environments at the onset of their formation, providing empirical data to help
constrain theoretical predictions of early structure formation.

Background: Error

Data: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Abstract: Synergies between JWST and ALMA are unveiling a population of bright,
super-early ($z>10$) galaxies, including systems like GS-z14-0 ($z=14.2$) and
GHZ2 ($z=12.3$) with extreme FIR line ratios (${\rm [OIII]88\mu m/[CII]158\mu
m} > 3$) that challenge galaxy formation models. To clarify this issue, we
identify in the SERRA zoom-in simulations a synthetic analogue, Amaryllis, of
these sources, and track its evolution from $z=16$ to $z=7$. During this
period, Amaryllis grows from $\log(M_\star/M_\odot) \sim 7.4$ to $10.3$,
linking super-early progenitors to the massive galaxy population at the end of
reionization. At $z=11.5$, Amaryllis closely matches the observed properties of
GS-z14-0, including $M_\star$, SFR, and the luminosity of FIR ([OIII]88$\mu$m)
and UV (e.g. CIII]$1908$) lines. We find that high [OIII]/[CII] ratios appear
during short, merger-driven starburst episodes, when low metallicity ($Z \sim
0.02\,Z_\odot$) and high ionization conditions ($U_{\rm ion} \sim 0.1$) push
the ISM far from equilibrium. These extreme FIR line ratios are thus transient
and linked to major mergers that ignite strong ionized gas outflows. Despite
such a dynamically violent environment, strikingly, Amaryllis develops a
dynamically cold gaseous disk ($V/\sigma \sim 4-6$) as early as $z \sim 11$,
while its stellar component remains dispersion-dominated down to $z\sim7$. The
co-existence of ordered rotation and merger-driven disturbances in $z>10$
galaxies can explain the tentative disk signatures in GS-z14-0.

**TL;DR**: 通过HST/STIS吸收光谱对16颗大质量恒星的研究，揭示了银河系内多相星际气体的运动学特征，表明盘状运动学气体延伸至至少1 kpc的晕中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 银河系内多相星际气体的研究对于理解气体流入和流出银河系盘的过程至关重要，但目前对气体运动学的系统性研究仍有限。

Data: 使用HST/STIS吸收光谱对16颗位于1.3至10 kpc光谱距离的大质量恒星进行了观测，覆盖了银经-30度至+30度和银纬-15度至+15度的区域。

Method: 通过测量800个紫外吸收线组分的速度质心，分析了分子CO、中性、低电离和高电离等多相气体的运动学特征。

Result: 研究发现619/800的组分速度与盘共转模型一致，表明盘状运动学气体延伸至至少1 kpc的晕中，并提供了可用于气体流动运动学建模的吸收线参数数据库。

Abstract: We present a systematic study of the multi-phase interstellar gas in the
Inner Galaxy using HST/STIS absorption spectroscopy of 16 massive stars located
at spectroscopic distances between 1.3 and 10 kpc in the region
$-30^\circ\lesssim l \lesssim+30^\circ$ and $-15^\circ\lesssim b
\lesssim+15^\circ$. These sight lines probe gas above and below the Sagittarius
Carina, Scutum Crux-Centaurus, Norma, and Near 3 kpc spiral arms in a range of
$z$-height from 0 to 1.5 kpc. Along the 16 sight lines, we measure velocity
centroids for 800 UV absorption-line components across multiple gas phases
(molecular CO, neutral, low ion, and high ion). We find that 619/800 components
have velocities that are consistent with a simple model of co-rotation with the
disk, indicating that multi-phase gas with disk-like kinematics extends at
least 1 kpc into the halo. We present a database of absorption-line parameters
that can be used for kinematic modeling of gas flows into and out of the
Galactic disk.

Abstract: The embedded phase is a crucial period in the development of a young star.
Mid-IR observations, now possible with JWST with unprecedented sensitivity,
spectral resolution and sharpness are key for probing many physical and
chemical processes on sub-arcsecond scales. JOYS addresses a wide variety of
questions, from protostellar accretion and the nature of primeval jets, winds
and outflows, to the chemistry of gas and ice, and the characteristics of
embedded disks. We introduce the program and show representative results.
MIRI-MRS data of 17 low-mass and 6 high-mass protostars show a wide variety of
features. Atomic line maps differ among refractory (e.g., Fe), semi-refractory
(e.g., S) and volatile elements (e.g., Ne), linked to their different levels of
depletion and local (shock) conditions. Nested, stratified jet structures
consisting of an inner ionized core seen in [Fe II] with an outer H2 layer are
commonly seen. Wide-angle winds are found in low-J H2 lines. [S I] follows the
jet in the youngest protostars, but is concentrated on source when more
evolved. [Ne II] reveals a mix of jet shock and photoionized emission. H I
lines measure accretion, but are also associated with jets. Molecular emission
(CO2, C2H2, HCN, H2O, ..) is cool compared with disks, and likely associated
with hot cores. Deep ice absorption features reveal not just the major ice
components but also ions (as part of salts) and complex organic molecules, with
comparable abundances from low- to high-mass sources. A second detection of HDO
ice in a solar-mass source is presented with HDO/H2O ~ 0.4%, providing a link
with disks and comets. A deep search for solid O2 suggests it is not a
significant oxygen reservoir. Only few embedded Class I disks show the same
forest of water lines as Class II disks do, perhaps due to significant dust
extinction of the upper layers [abridged].

Background: 开放星团（OCs）对理解恒星形成、动力学和演化具有重要意义，但其分层结构的形成机制尚不明确。

Data: 研究使用了279个邻近开放星团的空间分布数据。

Method: 分析了每个开放星团成员恒星的空间分布，并通过N体模拟（如OCSN 125）研究了分层结构的形成机制。

Result: 研究发现成员恒星较少的星团往往缺乏分层结构，而动力学因素（如最大质量恒星和双星比例）对分层结构的形成和破坏起关键作用。

Abstract: Context. Open clusters (OCs) are important for understanding star formation,
dynamics, and evolution. Previous studies have indicated a relationship between
cluster structure and member star properties, but the formation mechanism of
the layered structure of OCs remains unclear. Aims. We study the
three-dimensional spatial distribution of 279 nearby OCs to understand the
formation mechanism of the layered structure. Methods. We analyzed the spatial
distribution of member stars within each OC and correlated the presence of a
layered structure with the number of member stars. Additionally, we performd
N-body simulations to model the evolution of OCSN 125. We assessd the
correlation between the binary fraction, the most massive star, and the radius
of the layered structure in each simulated OC. Results. Our analysis reveals
that OCs with fewer member stars tend to lack a layered structure. The results
from N-body simulations indicate that the presence of a layered structure is
strongly influenced by dynamical factors, particularly the most massive star
and the binary fraction. Massive stars drive mass loss through supernova
explosions and stellar winds, which weaken the spatial layering. Furthermore,
clusters with higher binary fractions exhibit a weaker layered structure,
likely due to energy equipartition, dynamical friction, and perturbations
caused by binary systems. These factors contribute to delaying core collapse
and slowing the emergence of a layered structure. Conclusions. Our findings
suggest that dynamical interactions, including the effects of the most massive
stars and binary fraction, play a critical role in the formation and disruption
of the layered structure in OCs.

Background: 澳大利亚SKA探路者（ASKAP）为研究无线电波段的偏振和磁性宇宙提供了强大的新能力。POSSUM是一项开创性巡天，旨在填补现有研究的空白，并推动对宇宙磁性和偏振现象的深入理解。

Data: POSSUM将使用ASKAP在800-1088 MHz和1296-1440 MHz频率范围内的观测数据，覆盖南半球约50%的天空（20,630平方度）。

Abstract: The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) offers powerful new capabilities for
studying the polarised and magnetised Universe at radio wavelengths. In this
paper, we introduce the Polarisation Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism
(POSSUM), a groundbreaking survey with three primary objectives: (1) to create
a comprehensive Faraday rotation measure (RM) grid of up to one million compact
extragalactic sources across the southern ~50 per cent of the sky (20,630
deg$^2$); (2) to map the intrinsic polarisation and RM properties of a wide
range of discrete extragalactic and Galactic objects over the same area; and
(3) to contribute interferometric data with excellent surface brightness
sensitivity, which can be combined with single-dish data to study the diffuse
Galactic interstellar medium. Observations for the full POSSUM survey commenced
in May 2023 and are expected to conclude by mid-2028. POSSUM will achieve an RM
grid density of around 30-50 RMs per square degree with a median measurement
uncertainty of ~1 rad m$^{-2}$. The survey operates primarily over a frequency
range of 800-1088 MHz, with an angular resolution of 20'' and a typical RMS
sensitivity in Stokes $Q$ or $U$ of 18 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Additionally, the
survey will be supplemented by similar observations covering 1296-1440 MHz over
38 per cent of the sky. POSSUM will enable the discovery and detailed
investigation of magnetised phenomena in a wide range of cosmic environments,
as well as the interplay between these components. This paper reviews the
current science case developed by the POSSUM Collaboration and provides an
overview of POSSUM's observations, data processing, outputs, and its
complementarity with other radio and multi-wavelength surveys, including future
work with the SKA. [Abstract abridged]

Background: 理解星系团内介质（ICM）中的湍流对其演化和动力学至关重要，但目前对湍流统计特性的研究仍存在不足，尤其是在不同初始等离子体β条件下的表现。

Data: 使用3D磁流体动力学（MHD）模拟数据，模拟了星系团合并过程，涵盖不同初始等离子体β值（100、200和500）的场景。

Method: 采用3D磁流体动力学（MHD）模拟，结合二阶结构函数分析速度和磁场波动的标度关系，并测试了同步辐射强度梯度（SIG）方法在追踪磁场中的有效性。

Result: 研究发现气体密度和速度的统计分布在不同β场景下相似，但空间分布和形态模式存在差异；速度和磁场波动表现出明显的各向异性，且SIG方法在所有β场景下均能有效追踪磁场。

Abstract: Understanding turbulence within the Intracluster Medium (ICM) of galaxy
clusters is pivotal for comprehending their evolution and dynamics. Employing
3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of galaxy cluster mergers, we examine
the statistical properties of gas density, magnetic fields, and velocity,
particularly emphasizing the central regions spanning 400 kpc. The simulations
feature varied initial plasma $\beta$ values (100, 200, and 500), mirroring
conditions in massive cool-core clusters such as Perseus. Our findings indicate
that while the statistical histogram distributions of gas density and velocity
appear similar across different $\beta$ scenarios, their spatial distributions
and morphological patterns exhibit noticeable differences. Through the
application of the second-order structure function, we identified a scaling
relation in velocity fluctuations, characterized by a slope of 1/2 and
predominantly dominated by solenoidal components. Furthermore, our analysis
reveals a pronounced anisotropy in both velocity and magnetic field
fluctuations, with more significant fluctuations along the direction
perpendicular to the magnetic fields. This anisotropy is scale-dependent,
becoming more pronounced at smaller scales, and exhibits a decreasing trend in
scenarios where the magnetic field is relatively weak, particularly at
$\beta=500$. This suggests that the anisotropic nature of these fluctuations is
predominantly regulated by the magnetic fields. Additionally, we test the
efficacy of the Synchrotron Intensity Gradient (SIG) method for tracing
magnetic fields in these environments. The SIG shows a global agreement with
the magnetic field across all three $\beta$ scenarios, confirming the SIG's
insensitivity to the medium's magnetization level.

Background: ω Centauri（ω Cen）是一个重要的球状星团，其潮汐碎片的研究有助于理解银河系晕的形成和演化。目前的研究表明，ω Cen可能与独立的合并事件有关，但其与Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus（GSE）的关系尚不明确。

Data: 使用了APOGEE巡天数据，包括ω Cen核心区域的观测数据，以及463颗ω Cen潮汐碎片候选星的化学丰度数据。

Method: 通过训练神经网络对APOGEE观测数据进行化学标记，识别ω Cen潮汐碎片候选星，并结合动力学分析和N体模拟验证其起源。

Result: 研究发现463颗ω Cen潮汐碎片候选星，其化学丰度与ω Cen核心一致，动力学特征显示高径向作用量。模拟表明ω Cen前身是一个质量较大的矮星系（大于10^8太阳质量），并发现了一个金属贫乏但化学均匀的晕碎片。

Abstract: We identify stellar tidal debris from the $\omega$ Centauri ($\omega$ Cen)
system among field stars in the APOGEE survey via chemical tagging using a
neural network trained on APOGEE observations of the $\omega$ Cen core. We find
a total of 463 $\omega$ Cen debris candidates have a probability $P > 0.8$ of
sharing common patterns in their chemical abundances across a range of
individual elements or element combinations, including [C+N], O, Mg, Al, Si,
Ca, Ni, and Fe. Some debris candidates show prograde or retrograde disk-like
kinematics, but most show kinematics consistent with the accreted halo, showing
high radial actions, $J_{R}$, values. We find that a sample of
Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GES) members are chemically distinct from the $\omega$
Cen core, suggesting that $\omega$ Cen is associated to an independent merger
event shaping the Milky Way halo. However, a connection between GSE and
$\omega$ Cen cannot be ruled out. A detailed comparison with $N$-body
simulations indicates that the $\omega$ Cen progenitor was a massive dwarf
galaxy ($\gtrsim 10^8 M_{\odot}$). The existence of a metal-poor high-$\alpha$
chemically homogeneous halo debris is also reported.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 球状星团是理解银河系形成和演化的关键，但目前对中子俘获元素及其与多重恒星种群和星团起源关系的研究仍有限。

Data: 研究使用了来自Gaia-ESO Survey的14个球状星团数据，覆盖了-0.40到-2.32的金属丰度范围，并分析了FLAMES-UVES光谱中Y、Zr、Ba、La、Ce、Nd、Pr和Eu的丰度。

Method: 采用同质化方法分析了中子俘获元素的化学丰度，并与随机银河化学演化模型的预测进行了比较。

Result: 研究发现，除Zr外，模型能大致重现中子俘获元素的观测趋势；部分星团中热氢燃烧产物与s-过程元素的强相关性表明它们可能共享核合成场所；此外，原位和非原位星团的[Eu/Mg]比值存在显著差异，且II型星团的s-过程元素扩散比I型星团更大。

Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are key to understanding the formation and evolution
of our Galaxy. While the abundances of light and Fe-peak elements in GCs have
been widely studied, investigations into heavier, neutron-capture elements --
and their connection to multiple stellar populations and GC origins -- remain
limited. In this work, we analysed the chemical abundances of neutron-capture
elements in GCs to trace the Galactic halo and to explore possible links to the
MP phenomenon. Our goal is to better constrain the nature of the polluters
responsible for intracluster enrichment and to distinguish the origin of GCs
through the chemical signature of neutron-capture elements. We examined 14 GCs
from the Gaia-ESO Survey, spanning a wide metallicity range, [Fe/H] from -0.40
to -2.32, using a homogeneous methodology. We focused on the abundances of Y,
Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Pr, and Eu, derived from FLAMES-UVES spectra. These were
compared with predictions from a stochastic Galactic chemical evolution model.
With the exception of Zr, the model broadly reproduces the observed trends in
neutron-capture elements. In some GCs, we found strong correlations between hot
H-burning products (Na, Al) and s-process elements, pointing to a shared
nucleosynthesis site, e.g., asymptotic giant branch stars of different masses
and/or fast-rotating massive stars. We also detect a distinct difference in
[Eu/Mg] ratio between in-situ ($\langle$[Eu/Mg]$\rangle$ = 0.14 dex) and
ex-situ ($\langle$[Eu/Mg]$\langle$ = 0.32 dex) GCs, highlighting their
different enrichment histories. Finally, on average, Type II GCs (NGC 362, NGC
1261, and NGC 1851) showed a s-process element spread ratio between second- and
first-generations about twice as large as those seen in Type I clusters.

Abstract: Context. The outer Milky Way has a lower metallicity than our solar
neighbourhood, but still many molecules are detected in the region. Molecular
line ratios can serve as probes to better understand the chemistry and physics
in these regions. Aims. We use interpretable machine learning to study 9
different molecular ratios, helping us understand the forward connection
between the physics of these environments and the carbon and oxygen
chemistries. Methods. Using a large grid of astrochemical models generated
using UCLCHEM, we study the properties of molecular clouds of low oxygen and
carbon initial abundance. We first try to understand the line ratios using a
classical analysis. We then move on to using interpretable machine learning,
namely Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to understand the higher order
dependencies of the ratios over the entire parameter grid. Lastly we use the
Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection technique (UMAP) as a reduction
method to create intuitive groupings of models. Results. We find that the
parameter space is well covered by the line ratios, allowing us to investigate
all input parameters. SHAP analysis shows that the temperature and density are
the most important features, but the carbon and oxygen abundances are important
in parts of the parameter space. Lastly, we find that we can group different
types of ratios using UMAP. Conclusions. We show the chosen ratios are mostly
sensitive to changes in the carbon initial abundance, together with the
temperature and density. Especially the CN/HCN and HNC/HCN ratio are shown to
be sensitive to the initial carbon abundance, making them excellent probes for
this parameter. Out of the ratios, only CS/SO shows a sensitivity to the oxygen
abundance.

Abstract: IRAS 15398-3359, a Class 0 protostar in Lupus I star forming region, is
associated with three generations of outflows. The primary outflow, i.e., the
most recent one, shows internal structure named ``shell structure'' in the near
infrared emission map. The shell structure is also seen in the emission lines
of CO, H$_2$CO, and others species. We find a similar structure in an
underexpanded jet produced in aerodynamics and other engineering applications.
A high pressure gas ejected through a nozzle expands to form a supersonic flow.
When the pressure of the ejected gas becomes lower than that of the ambient
gas, the jet is compressed to form a shock wave. The shock heated gas expands
again to form substructures along the jet. We examine the similarity between
the primary outflow of IRAS 15398-3359 and industrial underexpanded jet and the
possibility that the shell structure of the former is due to repeated expansion
and compression in the direction perpendicular to the jet propagation.

**TL;DR**: 研究分析了恒星双星与超大质量黑洞（MBH）的潮汐相遇（Hills机制）如何影响双星的命运，发现轨道倾角、偏心率和相遇深度是关键因素，且多次相遇会增加双星瓦解的概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 恒星双星与超大质量黑洞的潮汐相遇（Hills机制）是银河系中心多种恒星现象的常见起源，但双星在相遇后的命运（如瓦解、合并或逃逸）尚未完全理解。

Data: 研究使用了限制性三体问题的形式化方法，模拟了初始为圆形轨道的双星在抛物线轨道上的演化。

Method: 通过限制性三体问题的形式化方法，分析了双星轨道参数对其命运的影响，并模拟了最多三次后续近心点通过的情况。

Result: 研究发现双星的命运强烈依赖于轨道倾角、偏心率和相遇深度，瓦解是最常见的结果；多次相遇可将瓦解概率提高20%以上，而逃逸的双星速度通常比被抛射恒星低两个数量级。

Abstract: A common origin for a host of stellar phenomena in galactic centres is the
tidal encounter between stellar binaries and a massive black hole (MBH), known
as the ``Hills mechanism''. Following the encounter, binaries may disrupt into
an ejected star and a captured one, they may merge, or survive to either fly
away or come back for one or more subsequent encounters, until they are either
disrupted or fly away. In this paper, we analyse how a binary's fate depends on
its orbital parameters, by following its evolution through up to three
subsequent pericentre passages. We choose an initial population of circular
binaries on parabolic orbits. We present results from our restricted three-body
formalism, whose strength lies in the ability to easily explore a
multidimensional parameter space and make predictions independent of the binary
physical properties. We find that fates depend strongly on orbital inclination,
how deep the encounter is into the MBH tidal sphere and on the binary
eccentricity, developed during encounters. Generally, non retrograde
trajectories, high eccentricities or deep encounters produce disruptions
preferentially. Disruption is the most common fate. A significant fraction of
the surviving binaries fly away at velocities typically two orders of magnitude
smaller than those of ejected stars. Multiple encounters boost disruptions by
20\% or more. Finally, using an example system, we investigate the effect of
finite stellar sizes and lifetimes, showing that mergers occur 31\% of the
time, and that disruptions are still boosted by 10\% through subsequent
passages.

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过分析银河系球状星团的初始质量和原始恒星比例，揭示了星团形成和动力学演化对其恒星组成的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 银河系球状星团由原始恒星（1P）和污染恒星（2P）组成，其原始恒星比例F1P与星团当前质量mprst呈负相关关系，但这一关系尚未完全揭示星团形成的信息。

Data: 研究使用了银河系球状星团的初始质量minit和原始恒星比例F1P的数据。

Method: 通过测试不同的溶解时间尺度（包括有无原始质量分层），研究者估算了星团的初始质量minit，并将其映射到(minit,F1P)空间中，分析了不同星团起源组的分布特征。

Result: 研究发现，初始(minit,F1P)分布比当前分布更紧凑，动力学演化导致星团在F1P与质量空间中分散；Disk初始分布最为紧密，且原始恒星比例F1P在初始阶段仅依赖于星团质量，而非金属丰度。

Abstract: Galactic globular clusters consist of two main stellar populations, the
pristine (1P) and polluted (2P) stars. The fraction of 1P stars in clusters,
$F_{1P}$, is a decreasing function of the cluster present-day mass, $m_{prst}$.
The information about cluster formation it contains has yet to be unlocked.
Paper I demonstrated that the observed distribution $(m_{prst},F_{1P})$ of
Galactic globular clusters can result from a pristine-star fraction that is
inversely proportional to their birth mass, $m_{ecl}$. This relation was then
calibrated with a fixed stellar mass threshold for 2P-star formation, $m_{th}$,
i.e., $F_{1P}=m_{th}/m_{ecl}$. We now estimate the masses $m_{init}$ of
Galactic globular clusters as they start their long-term gas-free evolution in
the Galaxy and we map their behavior in the $(m_{init},F_{1P})$ space. Several
dissolution time-scales are tested (with and without primordial mass
segregation), each yielding its own initial cluster distribution
$(m_{init},F_{1P})$. The $(m_{init},F_{1P})$ distributions are mapped according
to cluster origin, with the emphasis on the Disk, Low-Energy and Gaia-Enceladus
cluster groups of Massari et al. (2019). All three initial distributions
$(m_{init},F_{1P})$ are more compact than their present-day counterparts since
dynamical evolution scatters clusters in the $F_{1P}$ versus cluster-mass
space. The Disk initial distribution is the tightest one and potential reasons
for this are discussed. Its power-law representation allows us to generalize
the initial mass threshold of Paper I and prompts us to represent the cluster
$({\rm mass},F_{1P})$ distribution in a log-log space. No evidence is found
suggesting that, initially, the pristine-star fraction of globular clusters
depends on their metallicity on top of their mass.

**TL;DR**: 通过分析42颗OB型恒星和B型超巨星的光谱，确定了太阳附近区域的当前磷丰度，并讨论了非局部热力学平衡效应对磷离子线形成的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究旨在约束磷在恒星核合成过程中的银河化学演化终点，并为研究星际介质中磷在尘埃颗粒上的消耗提供丰度基线。

Data: 使用了42颗位于太阳附近约500 pc至2 kpc范围内的慢旋转主序OB型恒星和B型超巨星的高分辨率光学光谱。

Method: 开发了基于从头计算数据的P II/III/IV模型原子，并使用DETAIL和SURFACE代码进行非局部热力学平衡线形成计算，基于ATLAS12代码计算的局部热力学平衡线空白模型大气。

Result: 太阳附近区域的当前宇宙磷丰度为log(P/H)+12 = 5.36 +- 0.14，与太阳光球层丰度一致，但低于通过局部热力学平衡分析太阳型恒星中性磷线得出的结果；磷在尘埃颗粒上的消耗量约为0.25 dex。

Abstract: The present-day phosphorus abundance in the solar neighbourhood is determined
from a sample of OB-type stars. This is in order to constrain the endpoint of
the galactochemical evolution of phosphorus in the course of stellar
nucleosynthesis over cosmic time and to provide an abundance baseline for the
study of the depletion of phosphorus onto dust grains in the interstellar
medium. A model atom for P II/III/IV based on a comprehensive new set of ab
initio data for line transitions, photoionisations and electron-impact
excitation was developed. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) line
formation calculations with the codes DETAIL and SURFACE were conducted, based
on LTE line-blanketed hydrostatic model atmospheres computed with the ATLAS12
code. High-resolution optical spectra for a sample of 42 apparently slowly
rotating main-sequence OB-type stars and B-type supergiants in the solar
vicinity within ~500 pc and beyond, out to a distance of ~2 kpc, were analysed.
The non-LTE effects on the formation of the P II/III/IV lines are discussed.
Non-LTE effects on the stellar abundances range from zero to ~0.3 dex. Where
available in the spectra, ionisation balance between two phosphorus ionic
species is achieved. Accurate and precise abundances are provided for the
sample stars, statistical and systematic 1 sigma uncertainties are typically
each well below 0.1 dex. The present-day cosmic phosphorus abundance in the
solar neighbourhood is constrained to log(P/H)+12 = 5.36 +- 0.14, which is
compatible with the solar photospheric abundance, but lower than derived by LTE
analyses of neutral phosphorus lines in solar-type stars. The amount of
phosphorus depleted onto dust grains is ~0.25 dex.

**TL;DR**: 通过模拟星系团中铁的质量分布，研究发现模拟结果与观测数据在恒星成分上存在显著差异，导致铁在星系团内介质中的分配比例低于观测值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系团内介质（ICM）中的重元素（如铁）是气体与恒星成分相互作用的标志。然而，当前对星系团ICM金属丰度的观测结果对星系团内恒星产生足够铁以富集ICM的假设提出了挑战。

Data: 研究使用了448个模拟星系团的数据，这些星系团的质量M500大于1e14太阳质量，红移为z=0.07，来源于Magneticum宇宙学流体动力学模拟的高分辨率（352 cMpc/h）^3体积。

Method: 通过比较模拟星系团中铁在气体和恒星中的质量分布与低红移星系团的观测数据，评估了铁在ICM和恒星之间的分配比例。

Result: 模拟结果显示，铁在星系团中的分配比例对总质量的依赖性较弱，平均值接近1；但在最质量大的系统中，模拟的铁分配比例比观测值低近一个数量级，主要差异源于恒星成分。模拟星系团的恒星质量分数高于观测数据，导致恒星铁质量更高，从而影响了ICM的金属富集。

Abstract: Heavy chemical elements such as iron in the intra-cluster medium (ICM) of
galaxy clusters are a signpost of the interaction between the gas and stellar
components. Observations of the ICM metallicity in present-day massive systems,
however, pose a challenge to the underlying assumption that the cluster
galaxies have produced the amount of iron that enriches the ICM. We evaluate
the iron share between ICM and stars within simulated galaxy clusters with the
twofold aim of investigating the origin of possible differences with respect to
observational findings and of shedding light on the observed excess of iron on
the ICM with respect to expectations based on the observed stellar population.
We evaluated the iron mass in gas and stars in a sample of 448 simulated
systems with masses M500 > 1e14 Msun at z=0.07. These were extracted from the
high-resolution (352 cMpc/h)^3 volume of the Magneticum cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations. We compared our results with observational data of
low-redshift galaxy clusters. The iron share in simulated clusters features a
shallow dependence on the total mass, and its value is close to unity on
average. In the most massive simulated systems, the iron share is thus smaller
than observational values by almost an order of magnitude. The dominant
contribution to this difference is related to the stellar component, whereas
the chemical properties of the ICM agree well overall with the observations. We
find larger stellar mass fractions in simulated massive clusters, which in turn
yield higher stellar iron masses, than in observational data. Consistently with
the modelling, we confirm that the stellar content within simulated present-day
massive systems causes the metal enrichment in the ICM. It will be crucial to
alleviate the stellar mass discrepancy between simulations and observations to
definitely assess the iron budget in galaxy clusters.

Background: 星系团的质量剖面研究对于理解宇宙结构和暗物质分布至关重要，但目前对高质量星系团的质量剖面研究仍存在不足。

Data: 使用了来自CLASH、HFF、BUFFALO和CLASH-VLT项目的高质量光度和光谱数据，以及VLT的MUSE高分辨率光谱数据。

Method: 基于强透镜分析，采用贝叶斯方法拟合多种球对称质量模型（如NFW、Hernquist、beta模型等），并测试了结果的稳健性。

Result: 研究发现NFW、Hernquist和beta模型最适合拟合星系团的总质量剖面，并揭示了总质量与弱透镜结果之间的标度关系，为未来研究提供了便捷的星系团质量估算方法。

Abstract: We study the radial total mass profiles of nine massive galaxy clusters
($M_\mathrm{200c}>5\times10^{14}$ M$_\odot$) in the redshift range $0.2 < z <
0.9$. These clusters were observed as part of the CLASH, HFF, BUFFALO, and
CLASH-VLT programs, that provided high-quality photometric and spectroscopic
data. Additional high-resolution spectroscopic data were obtained with MUSE at
the VLT. Our research is based on strong lensing analyses that rely on these
measurements. From these data, we measure the projected total mass profiles of
each galaxy cluster in our sample. We fit these mass profiles with
one-component, spherically symmetric mass models including the
Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW), non-singular isothermal sphere, beta model, and
Hernquist profiles. We perform a Bayesian analysis to sample the posterior
probability distributions of the free parameters of the models. We find that
the NFW, Hernquist, and beta models are the most suitable profiles to fit the
measured projected cluster total mass profiles. Moreover, we test the
robustness of our results in a twofold way: we slightly modify the center of
the projected mass profiles and the radial range of the considered region. We
employ the results obtained with the Hernquist profile to compare our total
mass estimates ($M_\mathrm{H}^\mathrm{tot} = M_\mathrm{H} (r\rightarrow +
\infty)$), with the $M_\mathrm{200c}$ values from weak lensing studies. Through
this analysis, we find scaling relations between $M_\mathrm{H}^\mathrm{tot}$
and $M_\mathrm{200c}$ and the value of the scale radius, $r_\mathrm{S}$, and
$R_\mathrm{200c}$. Interestingly, we also find that the $M_\mathrm{200c}$
values, obtained by extrapolating the fitted total mass profiles, are very
close to the weak lensing results. This feature can be exploited in future
studies on clusters and cosmology, as it provides an easy way to infer galaxy
cluster virial masses.

Background: 精确宇宙学需要从小尺度宇宙结构中提取最大信息，这促使了高阶统计（HOS）的使用，但重子过程如何在小尺度上修正物质统计一直是一个挑战。

Data: 使用了FLAMINGO模拟数据，针对DES-Y3类红移分布（z小于等于2）进行分析。

Method: 采用了重子修正模型（BCM），通过修改暗物质模拟来模拟重子效应，并联合拟合弱引力透镜的两点统计、小波相位谐波系数、散射系数以及第三和第四矩。

Result: 研究表明，三参数版本的BCM能够在所有尺度（ℓ小于2000）和红移层上以2%的精度联合拟合多种统计量，证明了基于BCM的弱引力透镜推断在小尺度上利用非高斯信息的可行性。

Abstract: Precision cosmology benefits from extracting maximal information from cosmic
structures, motivating the use of higher-order statistics (HOS) at small
spatial scales. However, predicting how baryonic processes modify matter
statistics at these scales has been challenging. The baryonic correction model
(BCM) addresses this by modifying dark-matter-only simulations to mimic
baryonic effects, providing a flexible, simulation-based framework for
predicting both two-point and HOS. We show that a 3-parameter version of the
BCM can jointly fit weak lensing maps' two-point statistics, wavelet phase
harmonics coefficients, scattering coefficients, and the third and fourth
moments to within 2% accuracy across all scales $\ell < 2000$ and tomographic
bins for a DES-Y3-like redshift distribution ($z \lesssim 2$), using the
FLAMINGO simulations. These results demonstrate the viability of BCM-assisted,
simulation-based weak lensing inference of two-point and HOS, paving the way
for robust cosmological constraints that fully exploit non-Gaussian information
on small spatial scales.

Abstract: The sensitivity of direct detection experiments depends on the phase-space
distribution of dark matter near the Sun, which can be modeled theoretically
using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies.
However, capturing the halo-to-halo variation in the local dark matter speeds
-- a necessary step for quantifying the astrophysical uncertainties that feed
into experimental results -- requires a sufficiently large sample of simulated
galaxies, which has been a challenge. In this work, we quantify this variation
with nearly one hundred Milky Way-like galaxies from the IllustrisTNG50
simulation, the largest sample to date at this resolution. Moreover, we
introduce a novel phase-space scaling procedure that endows every system with a
reference frame that accurately reproduces the local standard-of-rest speed of
our Galaxy, providing a principled way of extrapolating the simulation results
to real-world data. The predicted speed distributions are consistent with the
Standard Halo Model, a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution peaked at the local
circular speed and truncated at the escape speed. The dark matter-nucleon cross
section limits placed by these speed distributions vary by ~60% about the
median. This places the 1-sigma astrophysical uncertainty at or below the level
of the systematic uncertainty of current ton-scale detectors, even down to the
energy threshold. The predicted uncertainty remains unchanged when
sub-selecting on those TNG galaxies with merger histories similar to the Milky
Way. Tabulated speed distributions, as well as Maxwell-Boltzmann fits, are
provided for use in computing direct detection bounds or projecting
sensitivities.

**TL;DR**: 通过新的恒星演化模型，研究发现质量损失在决定极高质量恒星的最终命运和不稳定性对超新星率中起关键作用，预测的附近宇宙中的不稳定性对超新星率比之前模型低两个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 极高质量恒星（VMSs，质量≥100太阳质量）在多个天体物理过程中扮演重要角色。在低金属丰度下，它们可能直接坍缩成黑洞，或以不稳定性对超新星的形式结束生命。最近的观测结果对附近宇宙中的不稳定性对超新星率密度设定了上限，但大多数理论模型预测的率超过此限。

Data: 使用了MESA代码计算的新的极高质量恒星演化轨迹。

Method: 通过MESA代码计算新的极高质量恒星演化轨迹，并分析不稳定性对超新星率密度在宇宙时间尺度上的演化。

Result: 研究发现，考虑光学薄和厚风过渡的恒星风模型预测的不稳定性对超新星率在红移z≈0时为约0.1 Gpc⁻³ yr⁻¹，比之前模型低两个数量级。主要贡献来自金属丰度Z≈0.001-0.002的恒星，而更高金属丰度的恒星即使初始质量高达500太阳质量也无法进入不稳定性对超新星状态。

Abstract: Very massive stars (VMSs, $M_{\star}$ $\geq$ 100 M$_{\odot}$) play a crucial
role in several astrophysical processes. At low metallicity, they might
collapse directly into black holes, or end their lives as pair-instability
supernovae. Recent observational results set an upper limit of $0.7\,{}\mathrm{
yr}^{-1} \,{}\mathrm{ Gpc}^{-3}$ on the rate density of pair-instability
supernovae in the nearby Universe. However, most theoretical models predict
rates exceeding this limit. Here, we compute new VMS tracks with the MESA code,
and use them to analyze the evolution of the (pulsational) pair-instability
supernova rate density across cosmic time. We show that stellar wind models
accounting for the transition between optically thin and thick winds yield a
pair-instability supernova rate $\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{PISN}}\sim{}0.1$
Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ at redshift $z\sim{}0$, about two orders of magnitude
lower than our previous models. We find that the main contribution to the
pair-instability supernova rate comes from stars with metallicity
$Z\sim{}0.001-0.002$. Stars with higher metallicities cannot enter the
pair-instability supernova regime, even if their zero-age main sequence mass is
up to 500 M$_\odot$. The main reason is that VMSs enter the regime for
optically thick winds during the main sequence at metallicity as low as
$Z\sim{4}\times{}10^{-4}$. This enhances the mass loss rate, quenching the
growth of the He core and thus preventing the onset of pair-instability in
later evolutionary stages. This result highlights the critical role of mass
loss in shaping the final fate of very massive stars and the rate of
pair-instability supernovae.

Abstract: We report the serendipitous discovery of an absorption feature at 4.8 keV in
the NuSTAR spectra of ESP 39607, a Seyfert 2 galaxy at $z = 0.201$, observed in
May 2023 and August 2024. The feature is detected in both observations with
individual significance levels between 2 and 3$\sigma$, computed with multiple
statistical methods. The combined probability of detecting it in both
observations is $\gtrsim$4$\sigma$. The absorption feature is consistent with
an ultra-fast inflow (UFI) potentially associated with Fe XXV or Fe XXVI
K$\alpha$ transitions. The inferred inflow velocity is $\sim$0.15-0.20$c$, with
an estimated launching radius of 22-89 $R_g$, depending on the assumed iron
transition and whether radiation pressure is accounted for. Photoionization
modeling associates the UFI primarily with Fe XXV K$\alpha$ absorption, blended
with a minor contribution from Fe XXVI K$\alpha$. Alternative explanations,
including associations with the warm-hot intergalactic medium or outflows of
lighter elements, were investigated but found unlikely. If confirmed, this
detection represents a rare example of a UFI, providing valuable evidence into
extreme and/or non-standard accretion processes near supermassive black holes.
Follow-up observations with higher-resolution X-ray spectroscopy, such as with
XMM-Newton or XRISM, will be essential to confirm the nature of this feature
and better constrain the physical mechanisms driving it.
