However, this approach has limitations due to the complex\ndynamical interactions between these structures and their environment.\nPerturbations such as tidal forces exerted by the Milky Way, the potential\nescape of stars, and passages through the Galactic plane can result in the loss\nof dynamical coherence of stars in these structures. Consequently, relying\nsolely on dynamics may be insufficient for detecting such disrupted or\ndispersed remnants. We combine chemistry and dynamics, integrated through a\nsystem of neural networks, to develop a clustering method for identifying\naccreted structures in the Galactic halo. We developed an integrated approach\ncombining Siamese neural networks (SNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs),\nautoencoders, and the OPTICS algorithm to create a comprehensive procedure\nnamed CREEK. This method is designed to uncover stellar structures in the\nGalactic halo. Initially, CREEK was trained on known globular clusters (GCs)\nand then applied to the dataset to identify stellar streams. CREEK successfully\nrecovered 80% of the GCs present in the APOGEE dataset, re-identified several\nknown stellar streams, and identified a potential new stream. Additionally,\nwithin highly populated stellar structures, CREEK can identify substructures\nthat exhibit distinct chemical compositions and orbital energies.

In this paper we aim to investigate\ncommon features of various early universe solutions to the Hubble constant\ntension. The physics of the early universe affects the size of the sound\nhorizon which is probed with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Within\nthe standard model, the size of the horizon (within limits of current\nmeasurements) is affected by processes that could occur between (approximately)\n1 day after the Big Bang and the last scattering instant. We focus on simple\nextensions incorporating Early Dark Energy (EDE) and show how such a model\naffects the inferred values of the Hubble constant. We compare this model to\nLambdaCDM models using MCMC analysis, likelihoods over the parameter space and\nBayesian evidence. The MCMC analysis shows that EDE leads to a decrease in the\nsize of the sound horizon that is consistent with H0 = 73.56 km/s/Mpc but we\nalso show that MCMC analysis favours increasing redshift and proportion of EDE.\nThe Bayesian evidence favours our EDE model for very narrow, finely-tuned\nparameter space.

Our goal is to study the\nphysical and dynamical state of the most conspicuous infalling group, on a\nfilament projected at 1.3 Mpc from the Abell 2142 centre. The galaxy group is\nthe leading edge of a spectacular trailing 700-kpc-long X-ray tail of hot gas\nstripped by ram-pressure. The infalling galaxies are not quenched yet, and are\nideal objects to study the transformation processes due to the cluster\nenvironment. We use integral field spectroscopy from MaNGA to derive stellar\nand gas kinematics, and MegaCam for ugr photometry. Stellar populations (with\nage and metallicity) are obtained through full-spectrum fitting using Nburst.\nThe gas kinematics and excitation are derived from the line emission of\nH$\\alpha$, [NII], [OIII] and H$\\beta$. The group contains four galaxies, of\nwhich two are merging and partly superposing on the line of sight. With a\nsimple parametric model for each velocity field, we succeed in disentangling\nthe contribution of each galaxy and derive their physical state and kinematics.\nThe galaxies are perturbed, and intra-group gas is observed as tidal tails and\nloops. They are mainly disks in rotation, although some regions reveal elevated\ndispersion, typical of out-of-equilibrium gas. All galaxies show sustained star\nformation, with a global star formation rate of 45 M$_\\odot$/yr. We conclude\nthat the long X-ray tail must have come from the hot intra-group medium,\npresent before the group infall, and does not correspond to the ram-pressure\nstripping of the galaxy gas. The galaxy interactions within the group are still\nenhancing the star formation, from the disks that are still rich in dense gas."}

The\nWL signal is most prominent around galaxy clusters, and can extend up to\ndistances well beyond their virial radius, thus constraining their total mass.\nNear the centre of clusters, where contamination by member galaxies is an\nissue, the WL data can be complemented with strong lensing (SL) data which can\ndiminish the uncertainty due to the mass-sheet degeneracy and provide\nhigh-resolution information about the distribution of matter in the centre of\nclusters. Here we present a joint SL and WL analysis of the Euclid Early\nRelease Observations of the cluster Abell 2390 at z=0.228. Thanks to Euclid's\nwide field of view of 0.5 deg$^$2, combined with its angular resolution in the\nvisible band of 0.\"13 and sampling of 0.\"1 per pixel, we constrain the density\nprofile in a wide range of radii, 30 kpc < r < 2000 kpc, from the inner region\nnear the brightest cluster galaxy to beyond the virial radius of the cluster.\nWe find consistency with earlier X-ray results based on assumptions of\nhydrostatic equilibrium, thus indirectly confirming the nearly relaxed state of\nthis cluster. We also find consistency with previous results based on weak\nlensing data and ground-based observations of this cluster. From the combined\nSL+WL profile, we derive the values of the viral mass $M_{200} = (1.48 \\pm\n0.29)\\times10^{15}\\, \\Msun$, and virial radius $r_{200} =(2.05\\pm0.13 \\, {\\rm\nMpc}$), with error bars representing one standard deviation.

This paper presents a novel\nmaneuver detection approach based on comparing the confidence levels associated\nwith the orbital state estimation and the observation likelihood. First, a\nconfidence-dominance maneuver indicator (CDMI) is proposed by setting a\nconfidence level for the state estimation and computing the maximum likelihood\nof the observation and its confidence level. The CDMI then flag a maneuver when\nthe observation's confidence level exceeds that of the state estimation,\nindicating that the observation is unlikely under the no-maneuver hypothesis\nwhile maintaining consistency with the prior state estimation confidence. To\nefficiently compute the maximum likelihood of the observation and obtain the\nCDMI, a recursive polynomial optimization method is developed, taking advantage\nof convex optimization and polynomial approximation. In addition, an integrated\nCDMI approach is developed to eliminate the need to manually select the state\nconfidence level. The integrated CDMI approach maintains high detection\naccuracy while simultaneously providing an indication of maneuver likelihood,\nthereby enhancing robustness and practical applicability. The performance of\nthe proposed CDMI-based maneuver detection approaches is evaluated against an\noptimal control distance metric and two mixture-based approaches.

The observation that many black holes have reached\nsupermassive status while obeying the Eddington limit is puzzling as accretion\nmodels are not spherically symmetric. We address this issue by illustrating the\nphysics behind a picture of inner disk accretion involving a geometrically\nthick, hot quasi-spherical flow and argue that such an inner region provides\nthe radiation that instantiates the Eddington limit. Given the energetics of\nthe inner disk edge, we show how the characteristic electron cross-section\ndrops below its Thomson value, allowing black holes to grow rapidly despite\nbeing Eddington-limited.

Although the overall magnitude of these offsets is modest, the\ntrends are statistically robust and consistent across the population.\nSuppression is prevalent in massive, gas-poor galaxies in high-mass halos,\nconsistent with thermal feedback inhibiting gas cooling. Enhanced SFRs appear\nin low-mass, gas-rich galaxies, suggesting AGN-driven compression may locally\ntrigger star formation. These trends emerge despite EAGLE implementing AGN\nfeedback as a single-mode, stochastic thermal process, indicating that such\nmodels can reproduce both quenching and triggering regimes. Our findings\ndemonstrate that AGN feedback extends well beyond host galaxies, impacting\nneighbouring systems in a non-uniform, distance-, mass-, and gas-dependent\nmanner. This non-local AGN influence represents a critical, yet often\noverlooked, mechanism in shaping galaxy evolution within large-scale\nstructures, bridging high-energy astrophysical processes and cosmic-scale\nenvironmental regulation."}

It operates in coincidence with the other detectors\nof the Pierre Auger Observatory particularly the Surface Detector (SD) and the\nFluorescence Detector (FD). As the largest cosmic-ray radio detector worldwide\nbefore the recent Observatory upgrade AugerPrime, AERA has played a pioneering\nrole in the development of radio technique for cosmic rays, providing\ncomplementary measurements and serving as a testbed for ideas that motivated\nthe build-up of a new Radio Detector (RD) as part of AugerPrime. We report on\nmeasurements of the depth of the shower maximum using the radio footprint,\ndemonstrating compatibility and competitive resolution with established FD\nresults. An absolute calibration of AERA is achieved by monitoring the sidereal\nmodulation of the diffuse Galactic radio emission for nearly a decade,\nconfirming the long-term stability of a radio detector with no significant\naging effects observed. This stability suggests that radio detectors could also\nbe used to monitor potential aging effects in other detector systems.\nAdditionally, we investigate the muon content of inclined air showers using\nhybrid SD-AERA events. Our results indicate that the muon content in measured\ndata is consistent with expectations for iron nuclei as predicted by\ncurrent-generation hadronic interaction models, confirming the well-known muon\ndeficit for the first time with radio data. These findings reinforce the value\nof radio detection for cosmic-ray studies and provide a foundation for the next\ngeneration of analyses with the AugerPrime RD."}

Despite its importance, the nature of the astrophysical\nsites where the r-process occurs, and the detailed mechanisms of its formation,\nremain elusive. The key to resolving these mysteries lies in the study of\nchemical signatures preserved in ancient, metal-poor stars. In this review, we\nexplore r-process nucleosynthesis, focusing on the sites, progenitors, and\nformation mechanisms. We discuss the role of potential astrophysical sites such\nas neutron star mergers, core-collapse supernovae, magneto-rotational\nsupernovae, and collapsars, that can play a key role in producing the heavy\nelements. We also highlight the importance of studying these signatures through\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic surveys, stellar archaeology, and multi-messenger\nastronomy. Recent advancements, such as the gravitational wave event GW170817\nand detection of the r-process in the ejecta of its associated kilonovae, have\nestablished neutron star mergers as one of the confirmed sites. However,\nquestions remain regarding whether they are the only sites that could have\ncontributed in early epochs or if additional sources are needed to explain the\nsignatures of r-process found in the oldest stars. Additionally, there are\nstrong indications pointing towards additional sources of r-process-rich nuclei\nin the context of Galactic evolutionary timescales. This review summarizes what\nhas been learned so far, the challenges that remain, and the exciting prospects\nfor future discoveries. The increasing synergy between observational\nfacilities, computational models, and large-scale surveys is poised to\ntransform our understanding of r-process nucleosynthesis in the coming years."}

Integrating two\ncomplementary detection technologies for neutrinos, optical and radio Cherenkov\nemission, in combination with a surface array for cosmic-ray air shower\ndetection, IceCube-Gen2 will cover a broad neutrino energy range from MeV to\nEeV. This index of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray\nConference in Geneva, Switzerland (July 15-24, 2025) describes research and\ndevelopment efforts for IceCube-Gen2. Included are summaries of the design,\nstatus, and sensitivity of the IceCube-Gen2 optical, surface, and radio\ncomponents; performance studies of next-generation surface detectors and in-ice\noptical sensors; advanced reconstruction techniques of cosmic-ray air showers\nand neutrino events; sustainability and environmental impact; and sensitivity\nstudies of astrophysical neutrino fluxes and cosmic-ray physics. Contributions\nrelated to IceCube and the scheduled IceCube Upgrade are available in a\nseparate collection."}
