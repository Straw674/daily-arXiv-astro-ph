It is compact ($\\sim$1$'$ radius, or $\\sim$1.4 kpc), dynamically cold\n($W_{50}=12$ km/s), non-rotating, and fairly massive, with an HI mass of $\\sim\n10^{6}$ $M_{\\odot}$. Here we present deep HST/ACS imaging designed to search\nfor a luminous stellar counterpart. We visually rule out the presence of any\ndwarf galaxy with stellar mass exceeding 10$^{3.5}$$M_{\\odot}$. A more robust\ncolor-magnitude diagram-based analysis rules out a 10$^{4}$$M_{\\odot}$ stellar\ncounterpart with 99.5$\\%$ confidence. The non-detection of a luminous component\nreinforces the interpretation that this system is a Reionization-Limited HI\nCloud (RELHIC); i.e., a starless dark matter halo filled with hydrostatic gas\nin thermal equilibrium with the cosmic ultraviolet background. Our results make\nCloud-9 the leading RELHIC candidate of any known compact HI cloud. This\nprovides strong support for a cornerstone prediction of the $\\Lambda$CDM model,\nnamely the existence of gas-filled starless dark matter halos on sub-galactic\nmass scales, and constrains the present-day threshold halo mass for galaxy\nformation."}

Although observational studies\nindicate that LISs are characterized by lower electron densities than their\nhost PNe, model predictions suggest higher total densities in these structures.\nThe detection of H$_2$ emission from LISs in more PNe could help reconcile the\nobservations with model predictions. Methods. Observations of five PNe with\nalready known LISs were conducted using the Near InfraRed Imager and\nSpectrometer (NIRI) mounted on the 8 m Gemini North telescope.

However, the most common parameterization, the S\\'ersic profile, has\nno closed form Fourier transform, requiring the use of computationally\nexpensive approximations. In this paper our goal is to develop an emulator to\nmimic the radial Fourier transform of the S\\'ersic profile, for use in profile\nfitting. We first numerically compute the radial Fourier transform and\ndemonstrate that it varies smoothly as a function of the S\\'ersic index and\n$k$, the spatial frequency coordinate. Using this set of numerically calculated\ntransforms as a training set, we use symbolic regression to discover an\nequation which approximates its behavior. This ensures the emulator will be\nbased on computationally efficient and differentiable building blocks. We\nimplement this novel rendering method in the pysersic profile fitter, and\nensure it is accurate by conducting both injection-recovery tests using model\ngalaxy profiles and applying multiple rendering methods to a real sample of\ngalaxies in HSC-SSP imaging. Crucially, the Fourier emulator rendering\ntechnique enables measurements of morphological parameters of galaxies 2.5\ntimes faster than standard methods with minimal loss in accuracy.

We obtained\nhigh-sensitivity and high-spectral resolution observations of HCO+ (J = 1 - 0),\nCS (J = 2 - 1), C34S (J = 2 - 1), H2CO (J ,Ka,Kc = 2,1,2 - 1,1,1), c-C3H2\n(J,Ka,Kc = 2,1,2 - 1,0,1), SO (N,J = 2,3 - 1,2) and 34SO (N,J = 2,3 - 1,2) with\nthe IRAM 30m telescope towards the dust peak of L1544. A non-Local\nThermodynamic Equilibrium radiative transfer code is coupled to the Markov\nChain Monte Carlo method to model the observations. We find that with just one\ntransition for each isotope, the modelling cannot find a global minimum that\nfits the observations. The derived fractional abundance profiles are compared\nto those computed with chemical models. The observed transitions trace gas\ncomponents with distinct dynamics at different distances along the radius of\nthe core. Moreover, the results evidence a poor reproduction of sulphur\nchemistry by chemical modelling and stresses the need to include a more\nconsistent S-depletion process to accurately reproduce the S-chemistry towards\ndense cores."}

This degeneracy allows acceptable fits across a range of\ndark matter profiles, from cuspy to cored. While we do not directly constrain\nthe inclination with our Jeans models, higher-order line-of-sight velocity\nmoments provide useful additional constraints: comparisons with scalefree\nmodels from de Bruijne et al.

We use data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)\nand the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in their region of overlap to\ndemonstrate informative tSZ splitting of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). We\ndiscover a significant increase in the large-scale clustering of DESI LRGs\ncorresponding to detections starting from 1-2 sigma in the ACT DR6 + Planck tSZ\nCompton-$y$ map, below the cluster candidate threshold (4 sigma). We also find\nthat such galaxies have higher line-of-sight coordinate (and velocity)\ndispersions and a higher number of close neighbors than both the full sample\nand near-zero tSZ regions. We produce simple simulations of tSZ maps that are\nintrinsically consistent with galaxy catalogs and do not include systematic\neffects, and find a similar pattern of large-scale clustering enhancement with\ntSZ effect significance. Moreover, we observe that this relative bias pattern\nremains largely unchanged with variations in the galaxy-halo connection model\nin our simulations. This is promising for future cosmological inference from\ntSZ-split clustering with semi-analytical models.

While most studies assume idealized vacuum\nbackgrounds, realistic extreme-mass-ratio binaries are embedded in\nastrophysical environments, such as accretion disks, stellar clusters, or dark\nmatter spikes, disks and halos, that can significantly alter the orbital\ndynamics. We explore bound geodesics around general-relativistic solutions\ndescribing rotating black holes surrounded by matter halos, for the first time,\nand map how environmental effects meddle with the spacetime symmetries of\nvacuum spinning (Kerr) black holes. In particular, we find that the loss of a\nCarter-like constant leads to geodesic non-integrability and the onset of\nchaos. This manifests through resonant island and chaotic layer formations\naround transient orbital resonances in phase space; features that are otherwise\ncompletely absent in integrable Kerr geodesics. Resonant islands, which are\nextended, non-zero volume regions in phase space, encapsulate periodic orbit\npoints. Non-integrability ensures that the periodicity of the central resonant\npoint is shared throughout the island's geodesics, thus effectively enhancing\nthe lifespan of resonances, beyond Kerr-based predictions.

However, the most common parameterization, the S\\'ersic profile, has\nno closed form Fourier transform, requiring the use of computationally\nexpensive approximations. In this paper our goal is to develop an emulator to\nmimic the radial Fourier transform of the S\\'ersic profile, for use in profile\nfitting. We first numerically compute the radial Fourier transform and\ndemonstrate that it varies smoothly as a function of the S\\'ersic index and\n$k$, the spatial frequency coordinate. Using this set of numerically calculated\ntransforms as a training set, we use symbolic regression to discover an\nequation which approximates its behavior. This ensures the emulator will be\nbased on computationally efficient and differentiable building blocks. We\nimplement this novel rendering method in the pysersic profile fitter, and\nensure it is accurate by conducting both injection-recovery tests using model\ngalaxy profiles and applying multiple rendering methods to a real sample of\ngalaxies in HSC-SSP imaging. Crucially, the Fourier emulator rendering\ntechnique enables measurements of morphological parameters of galaxies 2.5\ntimes faster than standard methods with minimal loss in accuracy.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS", "summary": "We derive atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances in young G-, K-, and\nM-type stars (temperatures between 6500 and 3100 K) using infrared APOGEE-2\nspectra. Atmospheric parameters were determined for 548 young stars in the\nOrion complex (Orion A, B, OB1, and $\\lambda$ Ori) using the TONALLI code. For\n340 slow rotators v sini $\\leq$ 30 km s$^{-1}$), we derived C, Mg, Si, K, Ti,\nand Fe abundances using 19 atomic lines, MARCS model atmospheres, and BACCHUS.\nTo mitigate the impact of circumstellar material, we excluded stars with\ninfrared excess identified via 2MASS and WISE photometry. We find sub-solar\n[X/H] abundance ratios, consistent across elements and among all four groups,\nsuggesting a chemically homogeneous Orion complex. We computed [$\\alpha$/Fe]\nfrom [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], and [Ti/Fe], obtaining a median of $-0.14 \\pm 0.04$,\nabout 0.10 dex lower than the value for nearby main-sequence stars ($-0.04 \\pm\n0.04$) at similar [Fe/H]. This result aligns with predictions from Galactic\nchemical evolution models. Furthermore, the median [C/H] abundance we derived\nfor Orion agrees with previous estimations based on the analysis of the ionized\ngas of the Orion nebula. This work sets the stage for extending the analysis to\nstars with circumstellar material and higher rotational velocities, which will\nnot only improve our understanding of Orion, but also provide critical insight\ninto the formation and evolution of young stars, as well as the chemical\nevolution of the Milky Way."}

O-stars in\nyoung dense clusters, young sparse associations, and even low-mass clusters\nthat formed in situ in the field have similar EB fractions. This uniformity\nsuggests that the formation of close massive binaries depends on small-scale\ngas physics, e.g., fragmentation and migration within protostellar disks,\nwhereas N-body interactions that scale with cluster density do not affect the\nclose binary properties of massive stars that remain in clusters. Conversely,\nejected O-stars in the field exhibit a lower close binary fraction.

One-dimensional local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE)\nabundances of K and other elements, including Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ni, were\nderived using spectral synthesis. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE)\ncorrections were applied to the K abundances by interpolating a precomputed\ngrid of corrections based on stellar parameters and the LTE K abundance. We\ndetected K I lines in seven stars with [Fe/H]$< -3.0$ and derived upper limits\nfor other stars in the same metallicity regime, making this sample well-suited\nfor investigating the nucleosynthesis origins of K in the early universe. We\nfound that the [K/Fe] and [K/Ca] ratios of the seven stars are enhanced\nrelative to the solar value, with a scatter of approximately 0.1 dex, as small\nas the typical measurement uncertainty. Under the assumption that each star\nformed from gas purely enriched by a single or a few massive stars' supernovae,\nthe small scatter in [K/Fe] and [K/Ca], contrasted with the $\\sim$0.7 dex\nscatter in [Na/Mg] ratios (after NLTE correction), suggests that the production\nof K in massive stars or their supernovae is independent of the processes that\ndrive Na/Mg variation.

The common strategy to solve the problem is to\nimpose a shift symmetry on the K\\\"ahler potential, but this often leads to a\nnegative potential in the large-field regime. To avoid negative potentials, an\nadditional superfield called the stabiliser is usually added with a desired\ninteraction. An alternative mechanism in supergravity, avoiding the use of a\nstabiliser superfield, was earlier proposed by two of us in the setup with a\nsingle chiral superfield having inflaton and goldstino amongst its field\ncomponents. In this work, we extend that alternative mechanism to\nmulti-superfield models of inflation, thereby providing a generic framework for\nembedding a wide class of single- and multi-field inflation models into\nsupergravity. We illustrate our approach by several concrete examples of\nmulti-field inflation and clarify the conditions required to avoid tachyonic\ninstabilities during multi-field evolution. Our proposal significantly broadens\nthe theoretical landscape of $F$-term inflation models in supergravity."}

By systematically analyzing a large sample of\ngroups, we find a robust perpendicular alignment between group spin and\nfilament orientation. Among all examined properties, only group mass and the\ndistance to the nearest filament significantly affect the strength of this\nalignment: more massive groups and those closer to filaments exhibit a stronger\nperpendicular signal. In contrast, the alignment is largely insensitive to\ngroup richness, the stellar mass threshold used to select member galaxies, and\nredshift. We further quantify the bias introduced by using member galaxies as\ntracers of group spin, finding a typical misalignment angle of $\\sim38^\\circ$\nbetween the spin measured from all dark matter particles and that inferred from\nmember galaxies, independent of group richness or stellar mass cut.

The sensitivity of\nthese searches is improved by combining the observations of dSphs made by\ndifferent gamma-ray telescopes. We present the results of a combined search by\nthe most sensitive currently operating gamma-ray telescopes, namely: the\nsatellite-borne Fermi-LAT telescope; the ground-based imaging atmospheric\nCherenkov telescope arrays H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS; and the HAWC water\nCherenkov detector.

We obtain constraints on the velocity-weighted cross\nsection $\\langle \\sigma \\mathit{v} \\rangle$ for DM self-annihilation as a\nfunction of the DM particle mass. This five-instrument combination allows the\nderivation of up to 2-3 times more constraining upper limits on $\\langle \\sigma\n\\mathit{v} \\rangle$ than the individual results over a wide mass range spanning\nfrom 5 GeV to 100 TeV.

We focus on scenarios where the dark\nmatter-baryon scattering cross-section scales as $\\sigma(v) =\\sigma_{0} v^n$,\nwith $\\sigma_{0}$ being the normalization constant, $v$ the relative velocity\nbetween dark matter and baryons, and $n$ characterizing the velocity\ndependence. Specifically, we emphasize two cases: Coulomb-like interaction ($n\n= -4$) and velocity-independent interaction ($n = 0$). Using detailed\nsimulations of the 21-cm power spectrum and the Fisher matrix formalism, we\nforecast the sensitivity of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA),\nwhich targets the frequency range 50-225 MHz, to both IDM and astrophysical\nparameters. We marginalize over key astrophysical uncertainties, including star\nformation efficiency, ionizing photon escape fraction, and X-ray luminosity.\nOur results demonstrate that 21-cm power spectrum measurements can\nsignificantly improve sensitivity to IDM cross-section, with at least a factor\nof five improvement over global signal forecasts for the $n=0$ case, and more\nthan an order of magnitude enhancement for the $n=-4$ scenario. These forecasts\nalso significantly improve upon the existing bounds from cosmic microwave\nbackground and Milky Way satellite abundance observations. Our analysis also\nshows that the IDM cross-section exhibits no correlation with the parameters\nassociated with star formation efficiency and ionizing photon escape fraction\nof Population-II stars. However, we find that the Coulomb-like cross-section is\npositively correlated with X-ray luminosity. Our results highlight the critical\nrole of accounting for astrophysical uncertainties in obtaining robust\ninferences of dark matter-baryon interactions from future 21-cm power spectrum\nobservations."}

Mineral detectors record\nand retain damage induced by nuclear recoils in synthetic or natural mineral\nsamples. The damage features can then be read out by a variety of nano- and\nmicro-scale imaging techniques. Applications of mineral detectors on timescales\nrelevant for laboratory experiments include reactor neutrino monitoring and\ndark matter detection, with the potential to measure the directions as well as\nthe energies of the induced nuclear recoils. For natural mineral detectors\nwhich record nuclear recoils over geological timescales, reading out even small\nmineral samples could be sensitive to rare interactions induced by\nastrophysical neutrinos, cosmic rays, dark matter and heavy exotic particles. A\nseries of mineral detectors of different ages could measure the time evolution\nof these fluxes, offering a unique window into the history of our solar system\nand the Milky Way. Mineral detector research is highly multidisciplinary,\nincorporating aspects of high energy physics, condensed matter physics,\nmaterials science, geoscience, and AI/ML for data analysis.

The forward modelling of observations,\nin particular of large-scale structure, often relies on large cosmological\nsimulations. While the so-called separate universe approach allows one to\naccount for the effect of curvature on the expansion rate in small sub-volumes,\nthe non-Euclidean geometry is harder to accommodate. It becomes important when\nobservables are computed over large distances, e.g. when photons travel to us\nfrom high redshift. Here we present a fully relativistic framework to run\ncosmological simulations for curved spatial geometry. The issue of consistent\nboundary conditions is solved by embedding a spherical cap of the curved\nspacetime into a hole within a flat exterior, where it can undergo free\nexpansion. The geometric nature of gravity is made explicit in our framework,\nallowing for a consistent forward modelling of observables inside the curved\npatch. Our methodology would also work with any Newtonian code to a good\napproximation, requiring changes only to the initial conditions and\npost-processing."}

This catalog yields the first\nradially-resolved 3D velocity dispersion profiles for Sculptor. We confirm mild\noblate rotation, with major-axis velocities reaching $\\sim 2$ km s$^{-1}$\nbeyond 20.0 arcmin. Using a methodology similar to that in the first paper in\nthis series, we solve the Jeans equations in oblate axisymmetric geometry to\ninfer the galaxy's mass profile. Our modeling reveals a significant degeneracy\ndue to the unknown galaxy inclination, which is overlooked under spherical\nsymmetry assumptions. This degeneracy allows acceptable fits across a range of\ndark matter profiles, from cuspy to cored. While we do not directly constrain\nthe inclination with our Jeans models, higher-order line-of-sight velocity\nmoments provide useful additional constraints: comparisons with scalefree\nmodels from de Bruijne et al. (1996) favor highly flattened (more face-on)\nconfigurations. Adopting an inclination well consistent with these comparisons\n($i = 57.1$ degrees), we find, alongside radial velocity anisotropy, a dark\nmatter density slope of $\\Gamma_{\\rm dark} = 0.29^{+0.31}_{-0.41}$ within the\nradial extent of the 3D velocity data, ruling out a cusp with $\\Gamma_{\\rm\ndark} \\leq -1$ at 99.8% confidence. This confidence increases for lower\ninclinations and decreases drastically for nearly edge-on configurations.

This background is the accumulated\nsignal from unresolved sources throughout cosmic history and encodes\ninformation about the merger history of compact binaries throughout the\nUniverse, as well as exotic physics and potentially primordial processes from\nthe early cosmos. Our cross-correlation analysis reveals no statistically\nsignificant background signal, enabling us to constrain several theoretical\nscenarios. For compact binary coalescences which approximately follow a 2/3\npower-law spectrum, we constrain the fractional energy density to $\\Omega_{\\rm\nGW}(25{\\rm Hz})\\leq 2.0\\times 10^{-9}$ (95% cred.), a factor of 1.7 improvement\nover previous results. Scale-invariant backgrounds are constrained to\n$\\Omega_{\\rm GW}(25{\\rm Hz})\\leq 2.8\\times 10^{-9}$, representing a 2.1x\nsensitivity gain. We also place new limits on gravity theories predicting\nnon-standard polarization modes and confirm that terrestrial magnetic noise\nsources remain below detection threshold. Combining these spectral limits with\npopulation models for GWTC-4, the latest gravitational-wave event catalog, we\nfind our constraints remain above predicted merger backgrounds but are\napproaching detectability. The joint analysis combining the background limits\nshown here with the GWTC-4 catalog enables improved inference of the binary\nblack hole merger rate evolution across cosmic time. Employing GWTC-4 inference\nresults and standard modeling choices, we estimate that the total background\narising from compact binary coalescences is $\\Omega_{\\rm CBC}(25{\\rm\nHz})={0.9^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\\times 10^{-9}}$ at 90% confidence, where the largest\ncontribution is due to binary black holes only, $\\Omega_{\\rm BBH}(25{\\rm\nHz})=0.8^{+1.1}_{-0.5}\\times 10^{-9}$."}

Our method projects galaxy Spectral Energy\nDistributions (SEDs) onto a two-dimensional map, identifying regions that are\nsparsely sampled by existing spectroscopic observations. These under-sampled\nareas are then augmented with simulated galaxies, yielding a more\nrepresentative spectroscopic training dataset. To assess the efficacy of this\nSOM-based data augmentation in the context of the forthcoming Legacy Survey of\nSpace and Time (LSST), we employ mock galaxy catalogues from the\nOpenUniverse2024 project and generate synthetic datasets that mimic the\nexpected photometric selections of LSST after one (Y1) and ten (Y10) years of\nobservation. We construct 501 degraded realisations by sampling galaxy colours,\nmagnitudes, redshifts and spectroscopic success rates, in order to emulate the\ncompilation of a wide array of realistic spectroscopic surveys. Augmenting the\ndegraded mock datasets with simulated galaxies from the independent CosmoDC2\ncatalogues has markedly improved the performance of our photometric redshift\nestimates compared to models lacking this augmentation, particularly for\nhigh-redshift galaxies ($z_\\mathrm{true} \\gtrsim 1.5$). This improvement is\nmanifested in notably reduced systematic biases and a decrease in catastrophic\nfailures by up to approximately a factor of 2, along with a reduction in\ninformation loss in the conditional density estimations. These results\nunderscore the effectiveness of SOM-based augmentation in refining photometric\nredshift estimation, thereby enabling more robust analyses in cosmology and\nastrophysics for the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory."}

We illustrate this with Standard-Model neutrino decoupling,\nstrong-washout leptogenesis, dark-matter scenarios where kinetic decoupling\nprecedes chemical freeze-out (resonant/forbidden, conversion/coannihilation,\ncoscattering), and dark sectors at with temperatures distinct from the\nvisible-sector temperature, with semi-annihilation or 3 $\\to$ 2 cannibal\ndynamics. The moral of the story is simple: Chemical equilibrium governs\nnumbers, kinetic equilibrium governs shapes. In an expanding Universe the\noperators that control them rarely fade at the same time, and when they do not,\nthe order of decoupling is model dependent. Turning to phase-space evolution\nwhenever momentum selectivity matters is the surest way to obtain robust\ncosmological predictions."}

In particular, we consider a higher-dimension operator\ncoupling the Kretschmann scalar to a baryon-number-violating current which\ngenerates an effective chemical potential at the black hole horizon and leads\nto asymmetric Hawking radiation. Relative to earlier studies, we account for\nentropy dilution from evaporation, incorporate chemical potential dependent\ngreybody factors and numerically track the fully coupled evolution of a PBH\npopulation in an expanding universe. We show that the observed baryon asymmetry\ncan be reproduced within a viable region of parameter space for several PBH\nmass spectra including log-normal, critical-collapse, and power-law\ndistributions."}
