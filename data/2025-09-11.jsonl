Submitted to ApJ", "summary": "Observations of extreme starbursts, often located in the cores of\nprotoclusters, challenge the classical bottom-up galaxy formation paradigm.\nGiant elliptical galaxies at $z=0$ must have assembled rapidly, possibly within\nfew 100 Myr through an extreme growth phase at high-redshift, characterized by\nelevated star-formation rates of several thousand solar masses per year\ndistributed over concurrent, gas-rich mergers. We present a novel view of the\n$z=4.3$ protocluster core SPT2349$-$56 from sensitive multi-cycle ALMA dust\ncontinuum and [CII]158$\\mu$m line observations. Distributed across 60 kpc, a\nhighly structured gas reservoir with a line luminosity of\n$L_\\mathrm{[CII]}=3.0\\pm0.2\\times10^9$ $L_\\odot$ and an inferred cold gas mass\nof $M_{gas}= 8.9\\pm0.7\\times10^{9}$ $M_\\odot$ is found surrounding the central\nmassive galaxy triplet.

For a dust temperature of 30 K,\nthe [CII] emission from the ejected clumps carry $\\gtrsim$3% of the FIR\nluminosity, translating into an exceptionally low mass-to-light ratio of\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{[CII]}=2.95\\pm0.3$ $M_\\odot$ $L_\\odot^{-1}$, indicative of\nshock-heated molecular gas.

We analyzed the deep and well-characterized sample of groups detected\nwith AMICO in the COSMOS(-Web) field. Our study of the quiescent galaxy\npopulation is based on a machine-learning classification tool based on\nrest-frame magnitudes. The algorithm learns from several traditional methods to\nestimate the probability of a galaxy being quiescent, achieving high precision\nand recall. Starting from this classification, we computed quiescent galaxy\nfractions within groups via two methods: one based on the membership\nprobabilities provided by AMICO, which rely on an analytical model, and another\nusing a model-independent technique. We then detected the RS by estimating the\nridgeline position using photometric data, followed by sigma clipping to remove\noutliers. This analysis was performed using both rest-frame and observed-frame\nmagnitudes with rest-frame matching. We compared the results from both\napproaches and investigated the $z$ and richness dependence of the RS\nparameters. We found that the quiescent galaxy population in groups builds up\nsteadily from z=1.5-2 across all richnesses, with faster and earlier growth in\nthe richest groups. The first galaxies settle onto the RS ridgeline by $z \\sim\n2$, consistent with current evolutionary scenarios. Notably, we reported a rare\noverdensity of quiescent galaxies at z=3.4, potentially one of the most distant\nearly RSs observed. Extending our study to X-rays, we found that X-ray faint\ngroups have, on average, lower quiescent fractions than X-ray bright ones,\nlikely reflecting their typical location in filaments.

Estimating the amplitude of the GWB from the local mass\nfunction is therefore simpler than general measurements of scaling relations\nand galaxy mass/luminosity functions for two reasons: the contribution to the\ncharacteristic strain is dominated by a narrow range of masses, and the mass\nproxy $X$ is always marginalized over. While consistent errors in $X$ in both\ncatalogs are irrelevant, relatively small biases between them can produce\nsignificant shifts in the predicted SMBH abundance.

This enables the identification and individual study of lensing\nevents that would otherwise only be accessible through statistical weak lensing\nanalyses. Our approach focuses on high-redshift SMGs from H-ATLAS in the range\n$1.2 < z < 4.0$, and searches for associated AllWISE sources within an angular\ndistance of 18 arcsec. Candidate lenses are selected based on their WISE colors\n($0.5 < \\mathrm{W2} - \\mathrm{W3} < 1.5$ mag), consistent with those of\nelliptical galaxies, and further filtered using $J-\\mathrm{W1}$ color and\nphotometric redshift cuts to reduce stellar contamination.

Two main formation models have been proposed: the hadronic model, in\nwhich relativistic electrons are continuously injected by cosmic-ray protons;\nand the leptonic turbulent re-acceleration model, where cluster mergers\nre-energise electrons in situ. A key discriminant between the two models would\nbe the existence of ultra-steep spectrum radio halos (USSRHs), which can only\nbe produced through turbulent re-acceleration. Here we report the discovery of\nan USSRH in the galaxy cluster SPT-CLJ2337$-$5942 at redshift $z = 0.78$ in the\nMeerKAT-South Pole Telescope 100 deg$^2$ survey. This discovery is noteworthy\nfor two primary reasons: it is the highest redshift USSRH system to date; and\nthe close correspondence of the radio emission with the thermal ICM as traced\nby $\\mathit{Chandra}$ X-ray observations, further supporting the leptonic\nre-acceleration model.

Erection of a high-altitude\nhose offers an affordable and near-term approach to deliver sulfur-bearing\nfluids to the stratosphere in order to perform geoengineering via solar\nradiation management. We discuss the design of a hose extending to an altitude\nof 20 km and sized to deliver 100 ktons of sulfur per year. The sulfur, in the\nform of H$_2$S, is pushed up the hose by a pump on the ground and then sprayed\nout at the top, forming H$_2$SO$_4$ aerosols which scatter enough sunlight to\nperform geoengineering. Because the hose operates continuously, it only has to\ndeliver about 50 gallons/minute (little more than a garden hose). The flux from\na single hose is not sufficient to stop global warming by itself, but is enough\nto test the effect of the aerosols, and, once replicated to about 20 sites\nacross the planet, can offset all the warming caused by atmospheric CO$_2$.\n  Two varieties of hose are presented here, one delivering H$_2$S as a liquid\nand the other as a gas. Pumping liquid H$_2$S through a narrow 20 km hose\nrequires high pressure, which can be handled by strong and lightweight hose\nwalls or by placing intermediate pumps along the hose. The hose is held up by a\nsuite of balloons, either all at its top, or with some placed along its length\nas well. The greatest challenge in suspending such a hose is wind, which if not\ndealt with properly (by streamlining both the balloons and the hose) will\ncollapse the hose.

We\nderive the criterion analytically using a toy model of hydrogen and oxygen, and\ncalibrate it for realistic compositions with metallicities in the range\n$Z/Z_{\\odot}=0.01-50$, using CLOUDY. We generalize the model to the\nThomson-thick regime, where we consider, alongside photoabsorption, electron\nscattering, Compton heating, Comptonization, and photon degradation. In this\ncase, the emergent spectrum depends on the boundary condition experienced by\nphotons scattered back towards the source. We discuss the effect of a\nreflective boundary and a reprocessing boundary. We provide simple criteria for\nthe expected absorption state, and discuss additional effects that alter the\nspectrum. The main motivation of our modeling is X-ray emission from supernovae\ninteracting with circumstellar medium; however, we expect it to be useful to\nmany other applications."}

Estimating the amplitude of the GWB from the local mass\nfunction is therefore simpler than general measurements of scaling relations\nand galaxy mass/luminosity functions for two reasons: the contribution to the\ncharacteristic strain is dominated by a narrow range of masses, and the mass\nproxy $X$ is always marginalized over. While consistent errors in $X$ in both\ncatalogs are irrelevant, relatively small biases between them can produce\nsignificant shifts in the predicted SMBH abundance.

Using H I column density measurements derived from H I Lyman alpha\nspectroscopy toward 164 stars inside 100 pc, we have generated 2D\nspatially-interpolated N(HI) maps for different distance shells.

For greater distance shells, log N(HI) increases to 18.3\n(10-20 pc), then to 18.4 (20-70 pc), and finally increasing to 18.6 (70-100\npc). This last increase is likely associated with the detection of the Local\nBubble boundary, thus making the plateau of column density from 20-70 pc\nnotable and suggestive of the rarity of warm LISM material beyond ~10-20 pc. We\nestimate that the uncertainties associated with N(HI) values inferred from the\ninterpolated sky maps are approximately inversely correlated with the number of\nsamples in each distance shell and are in the range of 0.20-0.48 dex, compared\nto 0.01-0.30 dex typically determined from direct Lyman alpha observations.
