By applying the UPMASK algorithm to Gaia astrometric data for the estimation of cluster membership probabilities, it has been determined that 808 stars in NGC 869 and 707 stars in NGC 884 exhibit the highest statistical likelihood of being cluster members. The fundamental astrophysical parameters of the clusters were inferred within a Bayesian framework using Gaia data and PARSEC stellar evolutionary isochrones, through the application of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique. The estimated parameters are: colour excess E(B-V) = 0.516 +0.17/-0.24 mag and 0.516 +0.22/-0.33 mag, distances 2376 +301/-278 and 2273 +230/-290 pc, ages log(t/yr) = 7.31 +0.17/-0.32 and log(t/yr) = 7.30 +0.13/-0.29, and metallicities [Fe/H] = -0.24 +/- 0.12 and [Fe/H] = -0.25 +/- 0.12 dex for NGC 869 and NGC 884, respectively. Since spectroscopic observations are not available for the clusters, SED analysis was employed for the member stars, yielding results consistent with those obtained using the MCMC method. Kinematic and Galactic orbital analyses suggest that the open clusters originated in nearby regions of the Galaxy. This interpretation is supported by their similar space velocities and Galactic orbital parameters. Furthermore, orbital integration over 1 Gyr indicates a potential interaction between the clusters within the next 11 Myr. This study provides strong evidence of a common origin and a possible future dynamical interaction, contributing valuable insights into the formation and evolution of binary open clusters in the Milky Way."}

The majority of the systems (~60%) is observed in the very deep NIRCam observations of the cluster AbellS1063 (GLIMPSE program), showing the power that deep observations, combined with lensing, has to reveal these primordial stellar structures. We perform simultaneous size-flux estimates in all available NIRCam filters and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis to recover star cluster physical properties. All star cluster candidates have very high magnification. Star clusters and clumps show similar ages and redshift distributions, although noticeable differences are seen in their masses, sizes and stellar surface densities inherent to the lack of resolution in the latter group. We reconstruct the formation redshift of star clusters and find that the large majority of the observed star clusters show young ages (<100 Myr) and seems to form at cosmic noon (CN,1<z<4). A small sample of CN star clusters is about 1 Gyr old, these potential globular clusters have formed well within cosmic reionization. Star clusters have stellar densities in the range 10^2 to 10^6 M/pc^2, with median values around 10^4 pc2. Their sizes and densities better overlap with those of nuclear star clusters in the local Universe. These intrinsic properties make high-z star clusters a viable channel to grow intermediate mass black holes. We use Bayesian inference to make first direct measurement of the star cluster mass function at z>1, based on a subsample of 60 star clusters younger than 100 Myr and with masses above 2e6 Msun. The star cluster mass function is well described by a power-law with slope beta = -1.89 suggesting that a power-law -2 function might already be in place in the distant Universe."}

We find that the intrinsic scatter in \\rline\\ does not significantly evolve with redshift across $3<z<7$, though it may increase at $z\\gtrsim8$. We build population-level toy models using \\texttt{fsps} to help interpret our observations, and find that scatter in \\rline\\ primarily reflects the amplitude of SFH fluctuations; this implies that our observed lack of evolution in the scatter of \\rline\\ is due to similar star formation burstiness from $z\\sim3$ to $z\\sim7$. Our observations are best reproduced by a set of SFHs with rising, long-duration, and large-amplitude bursts. Finally, we demonstrate that the toy model that best describes our $z\\sim6$ data can boost UV brightness by up to $ΔM_{\\rm UV}\\sim-2.0\\,{\\rm mag}$ compared with a 200\\,Myr constant SFH, and naturally produces a large number of galaxies at $z>10$.

The core of the approach is local: dot-product relations in the equatorial curved geometry relate the conserved light-deflection parameter to the observed detector angle at finite distance, providing a connection between sky positions and photon constants of motion. These local identities feed a closed model for the frequency shift of photons traveling between a maser clump circularly orbiting a black hole and a finite-distance detector, making explicit the dependence on the metric at emission and detection radii.\n  We also apply the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to this construction on the equatorial two-manifold as an intrinsic cross-check. This theorem provides a global consistency relation between the local emission and detection angles, helping to validate sign conventions and angle branch choices in the local setup. In this sense, the local and global perspectives on the megamaser system support each other.\n  To supplement the instantaneous information contained in frequency shifts, we incorporate the time-domain general relativistic invariant, the redshift rapidity. We further introduce a prospective angular-domain observable, the angular redshift rate, and give its analytic expression in the SSS framework. The results are formulated for generic SSS backgrounds, providing closed relations suited for likelihood-based inference from VLBI positions and spectral monitoring. In particular, for a Schwarzschild background, the black hole mass, its distance to Earth and megamaser orbital radius are fully constrained in the language of astrophysical observables."}

This discrepancy may be due to observational biases in bar detectability when comparing simulations with observations. We present a proof-of-concept study quantifying how Euclid-like observational conditions affect bar detectability in TNG50. We analysed the entire galaxy sample at $z = 0.5$ and highlight one borderline case with a bar length of 2.1 kpc and bar strength $A_2 = 0.4$. Synthetic images were produced with Monte Carlo radiative transfer and realistic post-processing, and analysed with ellipse fitting and Fourier decomposition, as well as the recently constructed Zoobot analysis. Results were compared to idealised, noise-free stellar mass maps. In the illustrative case the bar is clearly detected in the mass map and remains visible in the Euclid VIS $I_{\\rm E}$ filter, where Zoobot also classifies it as barred, but becomes undetectable in $Y_{\\rm E}$ and in the VIS-NISP RGB composite, with all methods failing outside VIS. Extending to the full $z = 0.5$ sample, Zoobot recovers only 31/141 galaxies, while $A_2$ and ellipse fitting perform better (80/141 and 67/141) but still miss many short or weak bars. When non-detections are counted as unbarred, the bar fraction of 44 percent falls to $12\\!-\\!33$ percent depending on the method. These results demonstrate the strong impact of observational effects on bar detectability and motivate bar-fraction estimates which incorporate realistic instrumental conditions across redshift in cosmological simulations."}

In the laboratory, we have quantified readout noise, dark current, gain, and full-well capacity via bias, dark, and photon transfer curve analysis at all acquisition modes.

The technique successfully reproduces the values in the manufacturer specifications.

In analogy to what occurs in the case of a homogeneous medium, there exist a family of solutions that satisfy the boundary conditions. A shooting method is employed to isolate those solutions that fulfill a specific set of physical and mathematical constraints. The tail is found to be both densest and slowest when the scaleheight $H$ is equal to the gravitational radius $ξ_{0}\\equiv GM/v_{0}^{2}$, where $v_{0}$ its relative velocity with respect to the medium. The location of the stagnation point is evaluated as a function of $H$ and $ξ_{0}$, and an empirical fitting formula is provided. While the distance to the stagnation point is maximized when $H\\simeq ξ_{0}$, the mass accretion rate attains its maximum value for $H \\ll ξ_{0}$ at fixed surface density. When instead the midplane density is held constant and $H$ is varied, the accretion rate hardly changes once $H$ exceeds about $2ξ_{0}$. Additionally, we investigate how both the drag force resulting from mass accretion and the gravitational drag arising from its tail depend on $H/ξ_{0}$. We highlight how the effect of varying the degree of mixing in the tail influences the resulting drag force. Finally, for the particular case of an infinitely thin layer, we provide a simple analytical solution, which may serve as a useful pedagogical reference."}

Submitted to MNRAS. Comments are welcome", "summary": "Tomographic reconstruction of reionization is a long-sought goal. It would move the field beyond global summary statistics, such as the volume-averaged ionised fraction, to direct, field-level constraints on the ionization topology. With this in mind, we present TORRCH (TOmographic Reconstruction of the Reionization of Cosmic Hydrogen), a deep-learning framework that reconstructs the neutral-hydrogen fraction field during the epoch of reionization from the spatial distributions of Ly$α$ emitters (LAEs) and non-Ly$α$-selected galaxies (NLSGs) at luminosity limits comparable to current surveys. Using hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with radiative transfer, we train a deterministic 3D U-Net on mock surveys spanning diverse reionization scenarios and predict the neutral-fraction field. We find that TORRCH recovers the large-scale ionization morphology from synthetic data comparable to current surveys with high fidelity, and reproduces both the one-point distribution and the 2D power spectrum of projected neutral fractions. The predicted galaxy-IGM cross-correlation is also captured well, including the expected small-scale anti-correlation and its decline towards zero at large separations. Reconstruction quality depends on tracer completeness, with deep joint LAE+NLSG samples yielding the most accurate morphology, while LAE-only selections retain bubble-scale topology but with reduced fidelity. Robustness tests show that the method is stable to variations in ionization conditions between training and test data, and to realistic redshift uncertainties. Our results suggest that galaxy-based tomography can potentially deliver reliable reionization maps across realistic survey redshift windows."}

We selected a sample consisting of JO201 and JW100, undergoing ram-pressure stripping, and NGC 5291 and NGC 7252, formed through gravitational interactions, to investigate how different perturbation mechanisms influence dust content and star formation in extragalactic features. In both cases, star formation can be observed outside the main disks of the galaxies. We present new results of dust attenuation for JO201 and JW100, while for NGC 5291 and NGC 7252 we use results from our previous study, based on high-resolution observations obtained with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope onboard AstroSat. Dust attenuation is determined from the ultraviolet continuum slope ($β$) calculated using the FUV-NUV colour, and the star formation rates of the star-forming knots are corrected accordingly. It is seen that dust attenuation and dust-corrected SFR densities of the knots in the ram-pressure stripped tails of JO201 and JW100 are comparable to those in the collisional ring of the NGC 5291 system and the tidal tails of the NGC 7252 system. We conclude that, though the formation scenarios of the tails of JO201 and JW100, the NGC 5291 ring, and the NGC 7252 tails are different, their dust content and star formation activity are notably similar."}

This white paper explores three key science priorities in this field: unravelling the physics of cosmic inflation, investigating the accelerating expansion of the Universe, and precisely measuring the sum of the neutrino masses. Achieving these goals requires a dedicated survey to map the large-scale structure at high redshift in unprecedented detail. We describe how this can be achieved through a mission concept called SIRMOS, providing a high-throughput, highly multiplexed spectroscopic capability to obtain accurate redshifts for over 100 million galaxies over a wide sky area. Such a survey would leverage the deepest existing wide-area photometric catalogues for targeting, with spectra offering continuous 1.25-2.5~$μ$m wavelength coverage at moderate resolution, allowing precise redshift measurements in the $1<z<4$ range with minimal bias. We outline the scientific opportunities this presents. Recent years have seen significant advances in instrumentation, including digital micromirror devices, complex telescope mirrors, large detector arrays, and data processing pipelines. While these technologies have been demonstrated in terrestrial applications, such a survey is a unique opportunity to apply these proven capabilities in space to address fundamental questions in cosmology. Participation in such a mission will simultaneously deliver a compelling science case, help align UK Space Agency and STFC strategies, demonstrate the UK's growing capability in end-to-end space missions, and strengthen the national space economy through high-value industrial participation."}

However, direct evidence for a hot (million-Kelvin) CGM around present-day L* galaxies remains elusive. Here, we present the first systematic search of the hot CGM around nearby (< 50 Mpc) L* galaxies, by stacking their X-ray images and spectra from the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey. Significant diffuse X-ray emission is detected out to ~ 50 kpc, with spectral signatures consistent with a hot gas but arguing against a predominantly non-thermal origin. The radial distribution and total amount of the hot gas are in agreement with prediction by IllustrisTNG simulations. The constraints on the hot CGM derived in this study hold promise for calibrating key physical processes in next-generation cosmological simulations."}

However, traditional social media is reliant on benevolent corporations providing a free service without compromising on quality, and the recent takeover and decline of Twitter has shown how vulnerable these platforms can be. In this proceeding, we present The Astrosky Ecosystem, which is an initiative to develop open-source tools and integrations for social media, principally the Bluesky social network.

Both trace cosmic-ray electrons in the intracluster medium, though recent observations suggest their distinction is not always clear. We present new 903-1655 MHz MeerKAT observations of Abell 1775 and Abell 1795, both hosting cool cores and cold fronts. Combined with reprocessed 120-168 MHz LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey data, we perform imaging and spectral analyses of their radio emission. In both clusters, we detect radio haloes with distinct inner and outer components. In Abell 1775, the halo appears diffuse at 1.3 GHz, while LOFAR images reveal steep-spectrum filaments. In Abell 1795, the inner component corresponds to a previously reported mini-halo candidate, but the full structure extends to $\\sim$1 Mpc with a spectral index of $α=-1.08\\pm0.06$. The presence of such a large, flat-spectrum halo in a dynamically relaxed cluster makes Abell 1795 an outlier relative to typical merging systems. This suggests that some relaxed clusters may still retain sufficient turbulence to sustain particle re-acceleration, or that hadronic interactions producing secondary electrons play a significant role. Together with other recent discoveries in cool-core systems, our results indicate that some large radio haloes may have been overlooked in past studies due to limited dynamic range near bright central AGN. Finally, we detect steep-spectrum emission south of Abell 1795's central AGN, tracing a 45 kpc X-ray and optical filament that terminates in an X-ray cavity, likely linked to a past AGN outburst."}

Elemental abundances based on high-resolution spectra are provided for 487 RRLs and 64 BHB stars. We identified candidate RRLs associated to the main Galactic components and their iron distribution function (IDF) becomes more metal-rich when moving from the Halo ([Fe/H]=-1.56) to the Thick (TCD; [Fe/H]=-1.47) and Thin (TND; [Fe/H]=-0.73) disk. Furthermore, Halo RRLs and RRLs in retrograde orbits are $α$-enhanced ([$α$/Fe]=0.27, $σ$=0.18), while TCD RRLs are either $α$-enhanced ([Fe/H]$\\le$-1.0) or $α$-poor ([Fe/H]$>$-1.0), and TND RRLs are mainly $α$-poor ([$α$/Fe]=-0.01, $σ$=0.20). We also identified RRLs associated to the main stellar streams (Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus [GSE]; Sequoia, Helmi, Sagittarius) and we found that their IDFs are quite similar to Halo RRLs. However, GSE RRLs lack the metal-poor/metal-rich tails and their $α$-element distribution is quite compact. The iron radial gradient in Galactocentric distance for TND, TCD and Halo RRLs is negative and it decreases from -0.026, to -0.010, and to -0.002 dex/kpc. The iron radial gradient based on dry Halo (Halo without substructures) RRLs is, within the errors, equal to the global Halo. We also found a strong similarity between iron and [$α$/Fe] radial gradients of Milky Way RRLs and M31 globular clusters throughout the full range of galactocentric distances covered by the two samples."}

Accurately simulating its dynamics is critical to improving our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution, however, due to their multi-scale and multi-physics nature, multiphase systems are highly challenging to model. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of numerical simulations of multiphase gas in and around galaxies. We begin by outlining the environments where multiphase gas arises and the physical and computational challenges associated with its modeling. Key quantities that characterize multiphase gas dynamics are discussed, followed by an in-depth look at idealized setups such as turbulent mixing layers, cloud-wind interactions, thermal instability, and turbulent boxes. The review then transitions to less idealized and/or larger-scale simulations, covering radiative supernovae bubbles, tall box simulations, isolated galaxy models including dwarf and Milky Way-mass systems, and cosmological zoom-in simulations, with a particular focus on simulations that enhance resolution in the halo. Throughout, we emphasize the importance of connecting scales, extracting robust diagnostics, and comparing simulations to observations. We conclude by outlining persistent challenges and promising directions for future work in simulating the multiphase Universe."}

These massive clusters, identified in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program field, provide an ideal sample for probing the dynamical state of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the early Universe. We performed uniform X-ray imaging and spectral analyses to measure the ICM temperature and bolometric luminosity, and investigated cluster morphology through offsets between the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the X-ray peak. Extended X-ray emission was detected from all targets, but only one system was classified as dynamically relaxed, indicating a low relaxed fraction ($\\sim 10\\%$) at high redshift. By combining this high-$z$ sample with a lower-redshift CAMIRA cluster sample, we derived scaling relations among richness, temperature, luminosity, and mass. The results are broadly consistent with predictions from both the self-similar model and the baseline model incorporating the mass--concentration relation. We find no significant redshift evolution, strengthening the view that cluster scaling relations are largely established by $z \\sim 1$. We also examined the AGN fraction among member galaxies and found significantly higher AGN activity in high-redshift clusters, particularly in the outskirts, suggesting enhanced AGN triggering during early cluster assembly and a possible connection to the thermodynamic state of dynamically young clusters. These findings provide new insights into the formation and evolution of massive clusters and the thermodynamic history of the ICM, and complement large-area X-ray surveys such as eROSITA."}

Apart from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST-NIRCam (Near-infrared camera) photometry for these galaxies, there are JWST-NIRSpec (Near-infrared spectrograph) spectra for 13 galaxies and mid-infrared photometry (mostly JWST-MIRI) for 15 of them. Spectroscopical analyses included Balmer emission lines, Balmer + 4000 angstroms breaks or CaII lines. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with photometry include old and young stellar populations, emission lines associated to HII regions, AGN, interstellar dust extinction and intergalactic extinction from neutral hydrogen. By adopting realistic extinction curves and taking into account the V-shaped SED and low emission at near infrared at rest, the analyses show that AGN contribution in these galaxies ('little red dots' most of them) should be small on average in the reddest wavelengths, though important for few of the 31 galaxies. Average age of the 31 galaxies: $0.61\\pm 0.31$(95% CL) Gyr, while the average age of the $Λ$CDM universe is 0.70 Gyr. This corresponds to a formation epoch $z_{ form.}>11.2$(97.5% CL). Reddest galaxies present largest ages. One of these very red galaxies gets an age incompatible to be younger than the age of the Universe within $>4.7σ$. TP-AGB effect cannot explain this tension. None the less, there may be other uncertainties in the models, so this tension is a provisional result and further research is needed to confirm it."}

Our analysis employs a unified modelling framework that combines radial-velocity orbits, TESS light curves, and blue-to-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs), providing a robust alternative to traditional isochrone-based age determinations. By adopting common cluster-wide parameters (age, distance, and line-of-sight extinction) when solving for the stellar parameters of the binary components, we obtain a coherent set of masses, radii, effective temperatures, and luminosities for all twelve stars. The combined SED, eclipsing-binary, and radial-velocity analysis yields a well-constrained cluster age of $1.26 \\pm 0.09$ Gyr and an extinction of $A_V = 0.90 \\pm 0.05$ mag, while remaining consistent with the Gaia DR3 distance of $d \\simeq 2.06$ kpc used as an external prior. An independent Gaia DR3 astrometric analysis gives a distance of $2082 \\pm 142$ pc and confirms the membership of all six systems. The twelve binary components occupy the turnoff and subgiant regions of the cluster, enabling stringent evolutionary tests: in the radius--mass, radius--temperature, and temperature--mass diagrams, they show excellent agreement with modern stellar evolution models for the derived cluster parameters. NGC 7789 thus serves as a valuable benchmark for multi-observable, binary-based age determinations in open cluster studies."}

However, the extent to which B-fields are decisive relative to turbulence and gravity remains uncertain. This study aims to ascertain the role of B-fields in the fragmentation of molecular clouds. We examine the B-field observed with ALMA at core scales towards the infrared dark cloud G14.225-0.506, focusing on 3 regions with shared physical conditions, and juxtapose it with prior observations at the Hub-filament system scale. Our findings indicate a similar B-field strength and fragmentation level between the 2 hubs. However, distinct B-field morphologies are identified across the 3 regions where polarized emission is detected. In the region N, the large-scale B-field, which is perpendicular to the filamentary structure, persists at smaller scales in the southern half but becomes distorted near the more massive condensations in the northern half. Notably, these condensations exhibit signs of impending collapse, as evidenced by supercritical mass-to-flux values. In the region S, the B-field is considerably inhomogeneous among the detected condensations, and we do not observe a direct correlation between the field morphology and the condensation density. Lastly, in an isolated dust clump located within a southern filament of the northern hub, the B-field aligns parallel to the elongated emission, suggesting a transition in the field geometry. The B-field shows a clear evolution with spatial scales. We propose that the most massive condensations detected in the northern Hub are undergoing gravitational collapse, as revealed by the relative significance of the magnetic field and gravitational potential and mass-to-flux ratio. The distortion of the B-field could be a response to the flow of material due to the collapse."}

I obtained from GEMINI GMOS spectra mean radial velocities of star clusters formed in situ, which added to derived mean proper motions and heliocentric distances, allowed to compute their 3D space velocity components. These space velocities differentiate from those that the clusters would have if they instead orderly rotated with the galaxy, i.e., their residual velocities are larger than the upper limit for an object pertaining to the SMC main body rotation disk. The level of kinematic disturbance depends on the SMC rotation disk adopted; galaxy rotation disks traced using relatively old objects are discouraged.The resulting kinematic disturbance arises in younger and older stellar populations, so that the epoch of close interaction between both Magellanic Clouds cannot be uncovered on the basis of the kinematics behavior of stellar populations populating the outer SMC"}

The high resolving power, R~120000, enables the identification of extremely weak H2 lines in several rotational levels at a total column density of N(H2)~2x10^14 cm^-2, among the lowest ever measured in quasar absorption systems. Remarkably, this constitutes the highest-redshift H2 detection to date. Two velocity components are resolved, separated by only 3 km/s: a narrow (b~1.7 km/s) and a broader (b~6.2 km/s) component. Modelling the rotational population of H2 yields density of log nH/cm^-3 ~ 2.8 with temperature of ~40K (typical of the cold neutral medium) for the narrow component and log nH/cm^-3 ~ 1.4 , T~600K for the warmer, more turbulent component under a moderate ultraviolet (UV) field, suggesting at least several Mpc distance from the quasar. This system reveals the existence of tiny (down to ~0.01 pc), cold overdensities in the neutral medium. Their detection among only 7 damped Lyman-alpha systems in EQUALS suggests that they may be widespread yet usually remain undetected. H2 provides an exceptionally sensitive probe of these structures: even a minute molecular fraction produces measurable Lyman-Werner absorption lines along the extremely narrow optical beam -- the size of the quasar's accretion disc -- when observed at sufficiently high spectral resolution. High-resolution spectroscopy on extremely large telescopes may routinely detect and resolve such structures in the distant Universe, when 21-cm absorption will trace the collective contribution of many cold cloudlets toward larger radio background sources."}

However the significance of the discrepancy depends on understanding the systematic associated with crowding, metallicity effects, and extinction of the stellar tracers. Thus additional precision distance indicators in the local universe are desperately needed for investigating the H0 tension. The analysis of MUSE archival data makes the case that the Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function (PNLF) has become such an indicator, as the method can reach distances comparable to HST distances of Cepheid at a fraction of a cost, in terms of telescope time and ground-based. With new wide-field spectroscopic facilities it becomes possible to measure distances to early-type galaxies (ETGs) using the PNLF out to 100 Mpc distance, achieving a precise estimate for the H0 value which is independent of the Type Ia supernova calibration, with only single-epoch measurements."}

We find a critical collapse efficiency, $γ_{\\rm c} \\simeq 0.395$, above which the PBH mass grows without bound. This correction has profound implications for both PBH-induced reheating and dark matter (DM) production. Specifically, we find that the reheating temperature can be suppressed, and the DM parameter space for the PBH reheating scenario can undergo $\\mathcal{O}(10)$-$\\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ corrections, depending on the PBH formation mass and collapse efficiency. Moreover, our results significantly shift the parameter space in which PBHs can account for the entirety of the DM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive phenomenological study to incorporate thermal absorption into PBH evolution and quantify its impact on cosmological observables."}

We investigate the velocity structure of the multitemperature X-ray gas in M87, particularly in the eastern and southwestern arms associated with past AGN outbursts, using high-resolution spectroscopy from XRISM/Resolve. We analyze a mosaic of XRISM/Resolve observations covering the core of M87, fitting single- and multi-temperature models to spectra extracted from different regions and energy bands. We assess the line-of-sight velocities and velocity dispersions of the hotter ambient and cooler uplifted gas phases, and evaluate systematic uncertainties related to instrumental gain calibration. The hotter ICM phase, traced by Fe He-$α$ emission, shows velocity dispersions below $\\sim100$ km/s, and no significant velocity shifts between the arms and a relaxed offset region, suggesting limited dynamical impact from older AGN lobes. In contrast, the cooler gas phase appears to exhibit larger line of sight velocity gradients up to several hundred km/s as well as a higher velocity dispersion than the ambient hot phase, although these conclusions remain tentative pending improvements in the robustness of the gain calibration at lower energies. The first microcalorimeter-resolved map of gas dynamics in M87 supports the uplift scenario for the X-ray arms, with the cooler gas in the east and southwest seemingly moving in opposite directions along the line of sight. The kinetic energy is a small fraction of the gravitational potential energy associated with the gas uplift, and XRISM further suggests that AGN-driven motions may be short-lived in the hot ambient ICM. These constraints provide important input towards shaping future models of AGN feedback."}

Building on this, we propose a region (minor-axis and narrow major-axis cusp lenses) where flux-ratio anomalies persist even under globally parameterized models (\"macromodels\") with multipole freedom (capturing disk, asymmetric, or merger-driven structures).

Cosmography is useful for interpreting data in cosmology without imposing assumptions about the field equations of gravity or the matter content in the Universe. Some cosmography methods, denoted covariant cosmography, go even further and stay agnostic to the underlying space-time metric. Due to their high level of generality, covariant cosmography methods can incorporate the anisotropies and inhomogeneities in the observer's vicinity, and may in turn inform about the associated curvature of the relevant structures in our cosmic neighbourhood. Thus, covariant cosmography is a powerful model-independent tool for analysing cosmological data while also enabling the mapping of our local cosmic neighbourhood. In order to be able to explore the covariant cosmography framework to its fullest, it must be tested in tractable models and simulations. In this paper we derive the cosmography of luminosity distance to fourth order in redshift and investigate it in the special case of axially symmetric Szekeres models. We compare the numerical results for the distance-redshift relations of synthetic observers placed within the Szekeres structures with the predictions from the cosmography, and comment on the found level of approximation of the cosmography in relation to other results in the litterature."}

The high spatial resolution of JWST cleanly separates AGN emission from host-galaxy contamination, enabling detections of high-ionization potential lines more than an order of magnitude fainter than previously measured. Emission-line diagnostics reveal a transition at log($L_{bol}/L_{Edd}$) ~ -3.5, where the spectral energy distribution becomes increasingly deficient in ultraviolet photons. We find that rotational H$_2$ excitation temperatures are elevated (~500 K higher) compared to both higher-luminosity AGN and star-forming galaxies, while the H$_2$(0-0)S(3)/PAH$_{11.3 μm}$ ratios are consistent with those observed in the AGN population. We discuss the possible roles of outflows, jets, and X-ray dominated regions in shaping the interstellar medium surrounding LLAGN.

We adopt next stage SKA survey specifications, alone or in combination with concurrently expected DR3 Euclid survey release, paying attention to the modeling and recipe of the implementation of the galaxy clustering and lensing probes obtained from the two surveys. We consider two data mock models: one with deviation of the intermediate parameters at the level of 10 \\% (yielding however $w_{\\rm eff}=-1.03$) and another sub-percently close to $Λ$CDM. We found that the three parameters deviation from $Λ$CDM could only be detected at 1 $σ$ from SKA alone, while this improves to $\\sim$ 2 $σ$ when we combine with Euclid. An improvement of the order of 30\\% on the bounds is reached after projecting the three parameters into a single $w_{\\rm eff}$ parameter. However, this affects both cases and thus it does not change much, though it improves the level of detection with respect to $Λ$CDM values. We conclude that synergy from both surveys benefits to tighten our constraints, but also that our highly generalized parameterization, although impacting at both the background and the perturbation level, will be hard to disentangle from $Λ$CDM at the level at which our forecast is performed and it still needs, to the least, data from more advanced stages of the adopted surveys to hope reach this target."}

However, its value is often determined by considering an asymptotic constant value that works for all redshift, or else following a chosen parameterisation. Here we formulate the growth index as function of three quantities that could be directly related to observables in redshift bins, $fσ_8(z_i)$, $f(z_i)$ and $H(z_i)$. We determine its value and its derivative at observed nodal center of redshift bins and use the shape function method, after showing insightful connection with its underlying governing virtual-work conservation principle, to construct a redshift dependence of the $γ$ without assuming a specific parameterization. We then use the resulting shape function to test if we can disentangle between different scenarios where there are discrepancies between its three constituent measured components. We also tested whether it can be used to rule out models of modified gravity, or extended parametric models of the growth index that capture more general behaviors with an additional parameter as function of the scale factor or dark energy. Adopting forecasted measurements from next generation surveys on the three quantities used to construct $γ$, we find that reported discrepancies between them could be detected with our method, but at the bins where the errors and lost of precision from our addition of degrees of freedom is small with respect to the deviation of $γ$. The same could be concluded for first order extensions to $γ$ or common modified gravity models, and to a lesser degree for dynamical dark energy models after supposing the latest DESI values. We conclude that this method is a strong tool to investigate cosmology in a model-independent way especially with forthcoming data delivered by further stage-IV surveys with more stringent uncertainties.(Abridged)"}

Submitted to MNRAS. Comments are welcome", "summary": "Tomographic reconstruction of reionization is a long-sought goal. It would move the field beyond global summary statistics, such as the volume-averaged ionised fraction, to direct, field-level constraints on the ionization topology. With this in mind, we present TORRCH (TOmographic Reconstruction of the Reionization of Cosmic Hydrogen), a deep-learning framework that reconstructs the neutral-hydrogen fraction field during the epoch of reionization from the spatial distributions of Ly$α$ emitters (LAEs) and non-Ly$α$-selected galaxies (NLSGs) at luminosity limits comparable to current surveys. Using hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with radiative transfer, we train a deterministic 3D U-Net on mock surveys spanning diverse reionization scenarios and predict the neutral-fraction field. We find that TORRCH recovers the large-scale ionization morphology from synthetic data comparable to current surveys with high fidelity, and reproduces both the one-point distribution and the 2D power spectrum of projected neutral fractions. The predicted galaxy-IGM cross-correlation is also captured well, including the expected small-scale anti-correlation and its decline towards zero at large separations. Reconstruction quality depends on tracer completeness, with deep joint LAE+NLSG samples yielding the most accurate morphology, while LAE-only selections retain bubble-scale topology but with reduced fidelity. Robustness tests show that the method is stable to variations in ionization conditions between training and test data, and to realistic redshift uncertainties. Our results suggest that galaxy-based tomography can potentially deliver reliable reionization maps across realistic survey redshift windows."}

By adopting common cluster-wide parameters (age, distance, and line-of-sight extinction) when solving for the stellar parameters of the binary components, we obtain a coherent set of masses, radii, effective temperatures, and luminosities for all twelve stars.

We use \\texttt{CoLoRe} simulations to create mock DESI 5-year Ly$α$ forests and Rubin Observatory LSST 10-year photometric galaxies up to $z=3$, and measure the galaxy redshift distribution via their angular cross-correlations. Due to large redshift-space distortions in the Ly$α$ forest, the conventional $n(z)$ estimator for clustering redshifts does not apply, and we develope a theoretical framework to model the angular cross-correlation directly. Using the simulations, we explore effects of instrumental noise, continuum fitting, and contamination in the Ly$α$ forest, cross-correlation angular scales ($θ$), and redshift bin size ($Δz$) on the signal-to-noise (SNR) of the measurements. We find that continuum fitting methods strongly impact the SNR of the measurements. With our baseline continuum fitting method, \\texttt{LyCAN}, at angular scales $θ\\sim10$ arcmin and $Δz=0.1$, we measure the cross-correlation signal at $24σ$. If the shape of the redshift distribution and galaxy bias evolution are known well for $z<2$, the cross-correlation can constrain the mean redshift of the galaxy sample to $σ_z/(1+\\bar{z}) = 0.006$ at a mean redshift of $\\bar{z}=2$. This demonstrates that Ly$α$ cross-correlation is a reliable and promising method to calibrate the high-redshift tails of photometric Stage IV galaxy surveys."}

The high resolving power, R~120000, enables the identification of extremely weak H2 lines in several rotational levels at a total column density of N(H2)~2x10^14 cm^-2, among the lowest ever measured in quasar absorption systems. Remarkably, this constitutes the highest-redshift H2 detection to date. Two velocity components are resolved, separated by only 3 km/s: a narrow (b~1.7 km/s) and a broader (b~6.2 km/s) component. Modelling the rotational population of H2 yields density of log nH/cm^-3 ~ 2.8 with temperature of ~40K (typical of the cold neutral medium) for the narrow component and log nH/cm^-3 ~ 1.4 , T~600K for the warmer, more turbulent component under a moderate ultraviolet (UV) field, suggesting at least several Mpc distance from the quasar. This system reveals the existence of tiny (down to ~0.01 pc), cold overdensities in the neutral medium. Their detection among only 7 damped Lyman-alpha systems in EQUALS suggests that they may be widespread yet usually remain undetected. H2 provides an exceptionally sensitive probe of these structures: even a minute molecular fraction produces measurable Lyman-Werner absorption lines along the extremely narrow optical beam -- the size of the quasar's accretion disc -- when observed at sufficiently high spectral resolution. High-resolution spectroscopy on extremely large telescopes may routinely detect and resolve such structures in the distant Universe, when 21-cm absorption will trace the collective contribution of many cold cloudlets toward larger radio background sources."}

Read out with a Ge thermistor, the detector achieves a low energy threshold and, for the first time, enables the derivation of a dark matter exclusion limit using PbWO$_4$ as target material, for both spin-dependent interactions on neutrons and spin-independent interactions. Although limited in mass and not representative of the final RES-NOVA detector design, this prototype demonstrates effective control of mechanical vibrations and low-energy noise in a cryogenic system, which is a key requirement for rare-event searches. The experiment therefore provides a proof of principle for the RES-NOVA detection concept, validating the use of archaeological Pb-based PbWO$_4$ crystals, low-background operation, and robust data-analysis procedures.

If these couplings are sufficiently strong, Earth's atmosphere acts to shield the dark matter, thereby limiting the effectiveness of laboratory-based experiments. Experiments performed at altitudes exceeding the dark matter de Broglie wavelength experience the same orbit-averaged field amplitude as in the absence of scattering. Quantum clocks are capable of detecting variations in fundamental parameters due to the dark matter background. If based on the International Space Station, they are therefore well-suited to probe dark matter masses $m_{\\rm DM}\\gtrsim 10^{-9} \\text{\\, eV}$. Moreover, when the dark matter de Broglie wavelength is smaller than Earth's radius ($m_{\\rm DM} \\gtrsim 10^{-10}$ eV), the dark matter profile around Earth exhibits a dipole feature. In Low Earth Orbits this dipole temporally modulates potential dark matter signals. This provides a powerful cross-check of the orbit-averaged effect and can enhance the sensitivity of these experiments. We find optical clocks could give rise to world-leading constraints in some cases. Orbiting nuclear clocks could probe even more of the parameter space inaccessible to ground-based experiments."}

Building on this, we propose a region (minor-axis and narrow major-axis cusp lenses) where flux-ratio anomalies persist even under globally parameterized models (\"macromodels\") with multipole freedom (capturing disk, asymmetric, or merger-driven structures). Within this region, J1042+1641 is $>3σ$ incompatible with both CDM and SIDM. Our results yield a Bayes factor exceeding $100$, providing very strong evidence for FDM over even the most optimistic CDM and SIDM scenarios. As only 11 cusp lenses lie within this region, extending to larger samples will be essential for assessing its statistical generality and for decisively confirming these findings with future microlensing-free flux ratio data."}

It allows us to analytically and numerically analyze the $M1$ contribution to the $α(d,γ)^6$Li reaction. Isoscalar $M1$ transitions from an initial $S$ wave are shown to be forbidden in radiative capture reactions when distortion is neglected in the initial state. A calculation in a three-body model with proton, neutron, and a structureless $α$ interacting through effective forces leads to a negligible $M1$ $S$-factor at small energies. The dominant $M1$ contribution comes from transitions from an initial $S$ wave to isospin 1 components of the $^6$Li ground state. It is suggested that using this effective $M1$ operator in other models should clarify the origin of large discrepancies between $M1$ $S$-factors appearing in the literature."}

Among known young stellar objects (YSOs), those exhibiting the most dramatic increases in brightness due to sudden increase in mass accretion rate are eruptive young stars. Gaia20dsk is one of the Gaia-alerted young star candidates that has displayed a double, nonperiodic brightening resembling that of other young eruptive stars.\n  Aims. The goal of this work is to determine the physical and accretion properties of Gaia20dsk to confirm its classification as an eruptive young star.\n  Methods. We combined publicly available optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry with our X-shooter optical/NIR spectrum. In our analysis, we examined the optical and IR light curves from the bursts, reviewing the color-magnitude diagrams across different bands, reporting the detection of emission lines, and providing estimates of the star's accretion rates during the burst.\n  Results. The optical light curve shows two major and one brief brightening events with a maximum amplitude of ~1.8 mag in the last five years. A classification based on spectral index indicates that Gaia20dsk is a flat-spectrum star. The X-shooter spectrum exhibit emission lines characteristic of accreting low-to-intermediate-mass young stars, displaying features typical of MNor-type objects. The mass accretion rate is between (0.5-1.8)*10^{-6} M_sun/yr.\n  Conclusions. Gaia20dsk is an eruptive YSO that exhibits photometric features similar to those of MNors, including its characteristic brightening amplitude and burst duration, along with similar spectroscopic features and accretion rates."}

We first deform the GR Hamiltonian by adding an extra weight $+1$ density to the potential. We show that potential deformations of this type leave the (reduced) Dirac algebra unchanged and the modification is naturally reinterpreted as an effective anisotropic stress energy contribution. While the fluid reproduces an isothermal-like mass scaling, its pressure anisotropy prevents it from giving flat rotation curves. We then turn to HL gravity, where the deformed Dirac algebra induces a controlled nonconservation law for an emergent dust component. Generalizing earlier results, we identify a restricted class of LTB backgrounds for which the HL source term yields a positive scaling dark matter density, consistent with ghost-freedom, and recovery of GR in the infrared. The analysis is conditional on a prescribed background: obtaining a fully backreacted areal radius solution consistent with the HL field equations is left as a natural direction for future work."}

Apart from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and JWST-NIRCam (Near-infrared camera) photometry for these galaxies, there are JWST-NIRSpec (Near-infrared spectrograph) spectra for 13 galaxies and mid-infrared photometry (mostly JWST-MIRI) for 15 of them. Spectroscopical analyses included Balmer emission lines, Balmer + 4000 angstroms breaks or CaII lines. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with photometry include old and young stellar populations, emission lines associated to HII regions, AGN, interstellar dust extinction and intergalactic extinction from neutral hydrogen. By adopting realistic extinction curves and taking into account the V-shaped SED and low emission at near infrared at rest, the analyses show that AGN contribution in these galaxies ('little red dots' most of them) should be small on average in the reddest wavelengths, though important for few of the 31 galaxies. Average age of the 31 galaxies: $0.61\\pm 0.31$(95% CL) Gyr, while the average age of the $Λ$CDM universe is 0.70 Gyr. This corresponds to a formation epoch $z_{ form.}>11.2$(97.5% CL). Reddest galaxies present largest ages. One of these very red galaxies gets an age incompatible to be younger than the age of the Universe within $>4.7σ$. TP-AGB effect cannot explain this tension. None the less, there may be other uncertainties in the models, so this tension is a provisional result and further research is needed to confirm it."}

However the significance of the discrepancy depends on understanding the systematic associated with crowding, metallicity effects, and extinction of the stellar tracers. Thus additional precision distance indicators in the local universe are desperately needed for investigating the H0 tension. The analysis of MUSE archival data makes the case that the Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function (PNLF) has become such an indicator, as the method can reach distances comparable to HST distances of Cepheid at a fraction of a cost, in terms of telescope time and ground-based. With new wide-field spectroscopic facilities it becomes possible to measure distances to early-type galaxies (ETGs) using the PNLF out to 100 Mpc distance, achieving a precise estimate for the H0 value which is independent of the Type Ia supernova calibration, with only single-epoch measurements."}

We investigate the velocity structure of the multitemperature X-ray gas in M87, particularly in the eastern and southwestern arms associated with past AGN outbursts, using high-resolution spectroscopy from XRISM/Resolve. We analyze a mosaic of XRISM/Resolve observations covering the core of M87, fitting single- and multi-temperature models to spectra extracted from different regions and energy bands. We assess the line-of-sight velocities and velocity dispersions of the hotter ambient and cooler uplifted gas phases, and evaluate systematic uncertainties related to instrumental gain calibration. The hotter ICM phase, traced by Fe He-$α$ emission, shows velocity dispersions below $\\sim100$ km/s, and no significant velocity shifts between the arms and a relaxed offset region, suggesting limited dynamical impact from older AGN lobes. In contrast, the cooler gas phase appears to exhibit larger line of sight velocity gradients up to several hundred km/s as well as a higher velocity dispersion than the ambient hot phase, although these conclusions remain tentative pending improvements in the robustness of the gain calibration at lower energies. The first microcalorimeter-resolved map of gas dynamics in M87 supports the uplift scenario for the X-ray arms, with the cooler gas in the east and southwest seemingly moving in opposite directions along the line of sight. The kinetic energy is a small fraction of the gravitational potential energy associated with the gas uplift, and XRISM further suggests that AGN-driven motions may be short-lived in the hot ambient ICM. These constraints provide important input towards shaping future models of AGN feedback."}

Even compared to the limits from the neutrino detectors with a larger target size, LZ 2025 can put stringent constraints in certain parameter space of the mediator, excluding the previously unexplored regions."}

We present CosmoSlider, a lightweight visualization tool that enables real-time exploration of CMB power spectra as multiple cosmological parameters are varied simultaneously. The tool employs a neural-network emulator implemented using TensorFlow Lite, allowing rapid evaluation of spectra without relying on large grids of precomputed models or on-demand execution of Einstein--Boltzmann solvers. CosmoSlider is available both as an iOS application and as a web-based tool, making it accessible across platforms and suitable for use in classrooms, lectures, and self-guided study. By providing immediate visual feedback, CosmoSlider supports the development of intuition for the physical processes underlying CMB anisotropies and serves as a complementary resource to traditional theoretical instruction."}
