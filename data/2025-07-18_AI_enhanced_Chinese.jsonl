However, significant discrepancies\nremain between circular speed curves inferred from stellar dynamical modeling\nand those derived from the terminal-velocity method applied to gas kinematics.\nTo investigate this, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations\nincluding cooling, heating, star formation, and feedback, under a realistic\ngravitational potential derived from stellar dynamical models calibrated to\nobservational data.

Previous XMM-Newton data hinted at soft diffuse\nX-ray emission inside the ring but lacked sufficient exposure for detailed\ncharacterisation.
