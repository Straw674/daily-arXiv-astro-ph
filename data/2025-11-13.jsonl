Here we bridge these scales by embedding a first-principles, GRMHD-informed prescription for black hole accretion and feedback--derived from multi-zone simulations that self-consistently connect inflows and outflows from the horizon to the Bondi radius--within cosmological magnetohydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of $\\sim10^{14}\\,M_\\odot$ halos. These GRMHD results predict a \"suppressed Bondi\" regime in which magnetic stresses and relativistic winds strongly reduce effective accretion rates in a spin-dependent manner. We find that black holes cannot grow efficiently by accretion until they exceed $\\sim10^{7}\\,M_\\odot$, regardless of the feedback strength. Beyond this threshold, systems bifurcate: low-spin ($η\\!\\sim\\!0.02$) black holes continue to accrete without quenching star formation, while high-spin ($η\\!\\gtrsim\\!0.3$) black holes quench effectively but become starved of further growth. Early, massive seeding partially alleviates this tension through merger-driven assembly, yet an additional cold or super-Eddington accretion mode appears essential to reproduce the observed SMBH population and the empirical black hole--galaxy scaling relations. Our results demonstrate that GRMHD-informed feedback models can account for the maintenance-mode behavior of low-luminosity AGN like M87*, but cannot by themselves explain the full buildup of SMBH mass across cosmic time. A unified, multi-regime framework is required to capture the evolving interplay between spin-dependent feedback, cold inflows, and mergers in driving co-evolution."}

However, rest-frame optical tracers can miss sources with high dust attenuation, leading to misclassification of the dominant ionizing source. Longer wavelength tracers, such as those in the near-infrared, carry the power to diagnose ionizing sources while being more robust than optical tracers to the presence of dust. The diagnostics used in this work employ the ratios of bright near-infrared emission lines [S III] 9530, [Fe II] 12566 and [Fe II] 16443 to Paschen lines in publicly-available JWST/NIRSpec MSA medium-resolution spectroscopy of 55 galaxies at z < 3. We compare the rest-frame near-infrared and rest-frame optical diagnostics and find that ~90% of our sample have consistent classifications across wavelengths (49/55), while the remaining sources can be explained through ionizing radiation obscured by dust and/or elevated N/Fe abundances. We identify three objects classified as star-forming in the rest frame optical and as active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the rest-frame near-infrared, which we interpret as obscured AGN. We also identify three objects which are classified as AGN in the rest-frame optical and star forming in the rest-frame near-infrared. We interpret two of these objects as AGN with obscured star formation and the other with elevated N/Fe. We discuss how future spatially-resolved and/or mid-infrared spectroscopy can test the relative contributions of AGN and stars to the ionizing photon budgets of these disagreeing sources."}

These galaxies have formation times that cover well the range inferred from recent observational data, including a few rare objects with very short formation time-scales and early formation epochs. Model high-z quiescent galaxies are alpha-enhanced and exhibit a wide range of stellar metallicity, in broad agreement with current observational estimates. Massive high-z quiescent galaxies in our model occupy a wide range of environments, from void-like regions to dense knots at the intersections of filaments. Quiescent galaxies in underdense regions typically reside in halos that collapsed early and grew rapidly at high redshift, though this trend becomes difficult to identify observationally due to large intrinsic scatter in star formation histories. The descendants of high-z massive quiescent galaxies display a broad distribution in mass and environment by z=0, reflecting the stochastic nature of mergers. About one-third of these systems remain permanently quenched, while most rejuvenation events are merger-driven and more common in overdense regions. Our results highlight the diversity of early quiescent galaxies and caution against assuming that all such systems trace the progenitors of present day most massive clusters."}

We modeled key optical components, such as the transmission apodizing filter, the wavefront corrector, and the focal plane mask using the HCIPy package. A $10^{-8}$ contrast dark hole region, consistent with design specifications, was simulated using the Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) optimization method, and broadband observation effects were considered.

This model simulates complex instrumental features including dark current, charge transfer efficiency, clock-induced charge, multiplication noise factor, and various readout effects like striping and drift.

This selection method is uncommon, as most cluster samples in the literature are selected based on signals originating from cluster baryons. We analize a complete sample of 13 gravity-selected clusters at intermediate redshifts (with $0.12 \\leq z_{phot} \\leq 0.40$) with weak-lensing signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 7. We measured cluster richness by counting red-sequence galaxies, identifying two cases of line-of-sight projections in the process, later confirmed by spectroscopic data. Both clusters are sufficiently separated in redshift that contamination in richness can be straighforwardly dealt because the two red sequences do not blend each other. We find an exceptionally tight richness--mass relation using our red-sequence-based richness estimator, with a scatter of just $\\sim0.05$ dex, smaller than the intrinsic scatter of Compton Y with mass for the same sample. The lower scatter highlights the effectiveness of richness compared to Compton $Y$. No outliers are found in the richness-mass scaling, whether or not one cluster with a mass likely affected by projection effects is included in the sample. In the Compton $Y$-richness plane, the data do not delineate a clear trend. The limited sample size is not the sole reason for the unclear relation between Compton $Y$ and richness, since the same sample, with identical richness values, exhibits a highly significant and tight mass-richness correlation."}

This representative XRG sample includes 15 XRGs newly reported here, which we selected from the LOTSS-DR2 survey, following well-defined criteria. The evidence for in-situ particle acceleration comes from the observed cessation of steepening, or even flattening (i.e., gradient reversal) of the spectral index profile along the lobe into the associated wing, as determined here by combining the LoTSS-DR2 (144 MHz) and FIRST (1.4 GHz) maps. Interestingly, the afore-mentioned trends in spectral gradient, indicative of in-situ particle acceleration, are mostly found to set in near the region where the lobe plasma stream bends to connect to the wing. Such a spatial coincidence with bending of radio lobe/tail has been noticed in recent years for just a couple of radio galaxies. The large increase in such examples, as reported here, is expected to give a fillip to observational, theoretical and numerical simulation follow-up investigations of this important clue about the occurrence of in-situ particle acceleration in lobes of radio galaxies."}

Extended version of the conference paper arXiv:2307.04994. Comments welcome", "summary": "The advent of increasingly advanced surveys and cosmic tracers has motivated the development of new inference techniques and novel approaches to extracting information from cosmic fields. A central challenge in this endeavor is to quantify the information content carried by these summary statistics in cosmic fields. In particular, how should we assess which statistics are more informative than others and assess the exact degree of complementarity of the information from each statistic? Here, we introduce mutual information (MI) that provides, from an information-theoretic perspective, a natural framework for assessing the sufficiency and complementarity of summary statistics in cosmological data. We demonstrate how MI can be applied to typical inference tasks to make information-theoretic evaluations, using two representative examples: the cosmic microwave background map, from which the power spectrum extracts almost all information as is expected for a Gaussian random field, and the 21~cm brightness temperature map, from which the scattering transform extracts the most non-Gaussian information but is complementary to power spectrum and bispectrum. Our results suggest that MI offers a robust theoretical foundation for evaluating and improving summaries, thereby enabling a deeper understanding of cosmic fields from an information-theoretic perspective."}

A significantly larger number of identified GPs in the Local Universe might provide a better characterization of their high-redshift analogs and Lyman continuum escape. In this paper, we confront the challenges of robustly identifying GPs without spectroscopic information, a needed approach considering the incompleteness of spectroscopic surveys for compact sources. The principal difficulty stems from a significant contamination of photometric candidates by stars and quasars of similar color. To solve this, we introduce an SED matching method, which separates candidate GPs from contaminants on the basis of SDSS and WISE photometry of spectroscopically confirmed stars, quasars and galaxies. The method has an effectiveness of 85%, and a contamination rate of ~10%. With it we identify ~9600 GP candidates expected to lie in the 0.12 < z < 0.36 range - a tenfold increase over what would be selected using SDSS DR18 spectra. Some of the new GPs are as bright as r~19, and 1200 are predicted to have [OIII]5007 equivalent widths in excess of 500 A. The new population contains many \"Extended Peas\", which are absent among known GPs and possibly represent merging systems. We provide catalogs containing 8313 newly identified GP candidates, as well as 917 GPs confirmed using SDSS spectroscopy and 521 GPs with spectroscopic redshifts from LAMOST and other sources."}

However, AlMn has only barely been explored as a KID material. To this end, we first improved the modeling techniques used for Al KIDs within BCS theory by eliminating the use of analytical approximations for the expressions of the complex conductivity and found these changes reduced fit parameter degeneracy in the analysis of AlMn.

We present an analytical approach to describe the evolution of fluctuations in a mixed fluid composed of cold dark matter (CDM) and baryonic matter. Assuming that the Universe is governed by General Relativity, we employ the Vlasov equation to derive the general equations of motion for this mixed cosmological fluid, incorporating baryonic effects through the stress tensor by considering only the contributions from baryonic pressure. We introduce the Jeans filtering functions as a biasing tool that allows us to describe baryonic fluctuations with CDM as a tracer, and we obtain an analytical description of the fluctuations -a novel and uncommon approach compared to the accepted computational advances currently available in this field. First- and second-order solutions are obtained through a single iteration of the equations of motion, with the aim of identifying how the filtering scale behaves in a second-order theory compared to the linear one, as well as some of its impacts on the matter power spectrum without the need to compute it explicitly. For the first time, these kind of solutions are derived entirely through an analytical method. Finally, we obtain analytical expressions for baryonic fluctuations in the density and velocity fields, which can be readily evaluated and provide valuable insights into the role of baryons in the Large-scale structure of the Universe. Consequently, these results reveal how pressure effects shift the filtering scale and how including this component could influence parameters such as the filtering mass and the temperature of the pressure-supported components."}

Recent general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations demonstrate that strong magnetic fields can substantially suppress Bondi accretion by creating magnetically arrested disk (MAD) states, reducing inflow rates by up to two orders of magnitude relative to classical Bondi predictions. We incorporate this magnetic suppression prescription from Cho et al. (2023, 2024) into the Dark Sage semi-analytic model (SAM), which tracks SMBH and galaxy co-evolution within hierarchical merger trees derived from the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation. Implementing the suppression across different Eddington-ratio regimes, we explore its impact on black hole mass functions (BHMFs), stellar mass functions (SMFs), and AGN luminosity functions. Restricting suppression to sub-Eddington accretors ($f_{\\rm Edd} < 3 \\times 10^{-3}$) and rescaling AGN feedback efficiencies gives simultaneous agreement with observed $z = 0$ SMFs and BHMFs, as illustrated by Case D in this work. At $z > 6$, super-Eddington growth episodes dominate in the SAM, reproducing JWST-inferred luminous AGN number densities. Our results highlight the critical sensitivity of galaxy assembly to the coupling between small-scale accretion physics and large-scale feedback regulation. Magnetic suppression of hot gas accretion can reconcile low-redshift constraints while preserving the rapid black hole growth required at early cosmic epochs, thereby providing a physically motivated bridge between horizon-scale GRMHD simulations and cosmological galaxy-formation models."}

After correcting the inferred H$α$ velocities for asymmetric drift, we find a TFR of the form $\\log(M_\\ast / M_\\odot) = a \\log(V_{\\rm circ,f} / 150~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}) + b$, with $a=3.82^{+0.55}_{-0.40}$ and $b=10.27^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$, as well as a FR of the form $\\log(j_\\ast / \\mathrm{kpc\\,km\\,s^{-1}}) = a \\log(M_\\ast / 10^{10.5} M_\\odot) + b$, with $a=0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ and $b=2.86^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$.\n  When compared to their $z=0$ counterparts, we find moderate evolution in the TFR and strong evolution in the FR over the past $8$ Gyr. We interpret our findings in the context of the galaxy-to-halo scaling parameters $f_{\\rm M}=M_\\ast/M_{\\rm vir}$ and $f_{\\rm j}=j_\\ast/j_{\\rm vir}$. We infer that at $z=0.9$ both $f_{\\rm M}$ and $f_{\\rm j}$ are higher and less mass-dependent than at $z=0$. We speculate that the evolution of $f_{\\rm j}$ can be driven by more efficient and centrally concentrated stellar feedback at $z=0.9$, or by an appreciable dry merger history. We also show that assuming the galaxies populating our $z=0.9$ relations evolve into those populating the $z=0$ relations leads to an apparent discrepancy with the hierarchical growth of dark matter halos. To solve this issue, one needs to evoke a progenitor bias scenario, unknown systematics affecting our and previous measurements, or consider the possibility that H$α$ kinematics is not a reliable dynamical tracer."}

For this purpose, 30 catalogs of radio source positions computed in 1997-2025 were analyzed. Over these years, the median source position uncertainty represented by the semi-major axis of the error ellipse for 467 sources in common to all catalogs improved by one order of magnitude: from 0.156 mas to 0.015 mas. It was also found that the improvement in the position uncertainty over time follows a power law with high accuracy. The number of observations used for determination of the coordinates of the common sources in the input catalogs increased over time from 1.3 to 14.4 million, also following a power law. A discussion of the results led us to the conclusion that the number of observations is the primary factor in improving the source positions uncertainty compared to the number of sessions in which the source was observed."}

We investigate the clumping factor using the GAMER adaptive mesh refinement cosmological hydrodynamical simulation code. We introduce a new, physically-motivated definition of the IGM based on the effective transmission factor of ionizing photons. We perform large-scale, full-box simulations with varying intensities of the uniform ultraviolet background, and we find that our physically-defined clumping factor is significantly lower than the values derived from traditional overdensity thresholds. We also introduce an analytic model that distinguishes between the volume-weighted and mass-weighted averages of the neutral fraction, and we find the difference in reionization timing of $Δz \\sim 2$ depending on the assumed clumping factor and the relation between the volume-weighted and mass-weighted neutral fractions. Our zoom-in simulations further show that, while SN feedback increases the clumping factor locally, the effect is limited to $\\sim 100$ kpc scales and does not significantly alter the global clumping factor. The substantially lower clumping factor reduces the required ionizing photon budget, potentially alleviating tension for reionization scenarios driven by rare, bright sources like active galactic nuclei."}

Multiple possible seeding pathways have been proposed across a variety of mass scales, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. One such channel is a direct collapse black hole (DCBH), thought to form from the deaths of supermassive stars in pristine atomic cooling halos in the early universe. In this work, we investigate the ability to identify halos likely to form a DCBH based on their properties using a support vector machine (SVM). We implement multiple methods to improve the accuracy of the model, including selecting subsets of critical features and optimizing SVM hyperparameters. We find that our best model requires quantities relevant to star formation, such as the metallicity, incident flux of Lyman-Werner radiation, and halo stellar mass. The SVMs produced from this work can serve as probabilistic and holistic seeding prescriptions for DCBHs in cosmological simulations."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "A major goal of ongoing and future cosmological surveys of the large-scale structure is to measure local type primordial non-Gaussianity in the galaxy power spectrum through the scale-dependent bias. General relativistic effects have been shown to be degenerate with this measurement, therefore requiring a non-Newtonian approach. In this work, we develop a consistent framework to compute integrated effects, including lensing convergence, time delay, and integrated Sachs--Wolfe, along with the local relativistic projection and wide-separation corrections in the multipoles of the power spectrum. We show that, for a \\textit{Euclid}-like H$α$-line galaxy survey and a MegaMapper-like Lyman-break galaxy survey, ignoring these effects leads to a bias on the best fit measurement of the amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity, $f_{\\rm NL}$, of around $ 3\\,σ$ and $ 20 \\, σ$ respectively. When we include these corrections, the uncertainty in our knowledge of the luminosity function leads to further uncertainty in our measurement of $f_{\\rm NL}$. In this work, we show that this degeneracy can be partly mitigated by using a bright-faint multi-tracer analysis, where the observed galaxy sample is subdivided into two separate populations based on luminosity, which provides a $15$--$20\\%$ improvement on the forecasted constraints of local type $f_{\\rm NL}$. In addition, we present a novel calculation of the full multi-tracer covariance with the inclusion of wide-separation corrections~-- all of these results are implemented in the \\textit{Python} code \\textsc{CosmoWAP}."}

To address this challenge, we develop a deep learning framework based on a residual one-dimensional convolutional neural network for lensed GW identification under multiband observations. The model directly processes multiband waveforms from binary neutron star systems, covering the early inspiral observed by the DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO) and the late inspiral observed by the Einstein Telescope (ET), corresponding approximately to the wave-optics and geometrical-optics regimes, respectively. It enables end-to-end classification of five classes: pure noise, unlensed GWs, and three representative lensed GWs corresponding to singular isothermal sphere (SIS), cored isothermal sphere (CIS), and Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles. A dataset of 10^6 simulated samples was constructed with signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) ranging from 5 to 100. The deep learning model with multiband observations achieves an accuracy of 97.0% and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.97, significantly exceeding the single-detector performance, where DECIGO and ET reach 72.8% and 62.3%, respectively. Even in the low-SNR regime (SNR < 20), the model maintains an accuracy above 63%, while in the high-SNR regime (SNR > 80), its accuracy approaches 99.8%. These results demonstrate that multiband GW observations effectively enhance the detection of lensed GWs within complex noise environments, providing a robust and efficient pathway for the automated identification of lensed GWs in future multiband observations."}

In this paper, we study the Hubble tension problem in the framework of holographic dark energy (HDE). To perform a systematic and comprehensive analysis, we select six representative theoretical models from all four categories of HDE. For the observational data, we adopt the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), a collection of alternative BAO data, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) distance priors from the $Planck$ 2018, the type Ia supernovae (SN) data from the PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5 compilations. We find that HDE models that employ the Hubble scale or its combinations as the IR cutoff cannot alleviate the Hubble tension problem. In contrast, HDE models that employ the future event horizon as the IR cutoff can significantly alleviate the Hubble tension problem. It must be stressed that these two key conclusions hold true for cases of adopting different theoretical HDE models and different observational data. Our findings advocate for further exploration of HDE models using other types of cosmological observations."}

By extremising the Boltzmann entropy, we obtain the Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution for a self-gravitating isothermal Newtonian gas, which is a stationary solution of the Vlasov--Poisson system. From this distribution, the corresponding Poisson--Boltzmann equation for the gravitational potential is deduced. The second variation of entropy reproduces the classical Antonov instability criterion: the critical energy is $E_c \\simeq -0.335\\,\\frac{G M^2}{R}$, below which no local entropy maximum exists and the configuration becomes unstable (the so-called \"gravothermal catastrophe\"). In this work, we assume $E>E_c$, so all equilibria lie on the stable branch, and the Antonov instability does not affect the analysis. Specializing to spherical symmetry, we recover the classical equation for the isothermal gas sphere, as originally studied by Chandrasekhar, which has applications to the formation of red giant stars. We also derive the fundamental equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, the energy integral and the virial theorem directly from the stationary Vlasov--Poisson solution, demonstrating also that an isothermal gas exhibits negative specific heat.

Despite over 50 years of research and measurements their prompt emission remains poorly understood, with key questions surrounding the structure of relativistic jets, magnetic field configurations, and dominant radiation mechanisms. Polarization measurements are critical in resolving these uncertainties. The POLAR mission, operational in 2016-2017 on Tiangong-2, provided the most statistically significant GRB polarization data. Its results indicated low time-averaged polarization with hints of temporal evolution. However, POLAR's limited sensitivity, small effective area, and restricted energy range prevented more detailed time- and energy-resolved analyses in addition to a larger sample of GRB polarization measurements. POLAR-2 is designed to address these limitations by offering a fourfold increase in effective area (at least) and an extended energy range of 30-800 keV by utilizing Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) and an updated module design, enabling the differentiation of competing GRB emission models. The instrument comprises of 100 polarimeter modules (each with 64 plastic scintillator bars), wherein the polarization angle is extracted through Compton Scattering of the gammas.

In this paper we develop a phase-folding mapmaking framework to enable targeted searches of such periodic cosmological signals with frequencies up to the detector sampling rate of $O(100)$ Hz. We demonstrate the power of this framework with two cosmological applications: (1) constraining a stochastic gravitational wave background via its time-dependent lensing signature, and (2) the search for an oscillating polarization rotation from axion-like particles. We show that this technique transforms CMB experiments into broadband probes of the oscillating sky, extending their constraining power from the microhertz regime up to $O(100)$ Hz-an expansion of over seven orders of magnitude in frequency.

This kink is reproduced by TNG100 simulations, implying that hierarchical merger processes might explain it. Second, astrophysical scatter in N is high for galaxies with $σ< 100$ km s$^{-1}$. Due to the restricted list of nucleosynthetic sources for N, it is likely that asymptotic giant branch stars provide most of this N. A varied star formation history (compared to that of massive galaxies) along with variable retention and recycling of N-enriched gas might explain the fuzz of N abundance in low-$σ$ galaxies.

In the first case, the $k$-cut framework yields precise and unbiased $S_8$ constraints even with limited knowledge of large-scale modes. In the second, the BNT transform serves as a powerful diagnostic tool, revealing internal inconsistencies in the assumed IA model across $k$- and redshift-space, indicating that the corresponding cosmological constraints cannot be trusted until a more accurate IA model is adopted."}

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "Molecular gas traces both the fuel for star formation and the processes that regulate it. Observing its physical state (e.g., excitation) reveals when and why galaxies stop forming stars. We observed the CO(5-4) emission of 8 post-starburst galaxies at z ~ 0.6-1.3. To our knowledge, this is the first time that high-J transitions are probed for quiescent galaxies beyond the local Universe. All targets are detected in CO(2-1) or CO(3-2) and have molecular gas fractions up to 20%. Using the ratio R52=L'CO(5-4)/L'CO(2-1) as a proxy for gas excitation, we test how quenching occurs. Low R52 values would indicate suppressed fractions of dense/warm gas relative to cold and diffuse gas, while ratios typical of main-sequence galaxies would imply that quenching is still ongoing and that star formation may exhaust the remaining gas. On average our post-starbursts have R52 = 0.31, comparable to high-redshift galaxies. However, CO(5-4) non-detections, corresponding to galaxies without signs of interaction, yield R52<0.11, 2 times lower than local star-forming galaxies. The average CO Spectral Line Energy Distribution (SLED) peaks at J = 3, similar to the Milky Way. Three galaxies show signs of ongoing mergers and have R52 = 0.49 and CO SLEDs peaking at J > 4-5, similar to high-redshift galaxies. At least one requires additional mechanisms (AGN, shocks) to explain the rise of the SLED up to J=5. CO excitation helps distinguishing among mechanisms driving the low star formation efficiency (SFE) of post-starburst galaxies. The low SFE might be due to high kinetic temperatures and low gas densities yielding high excitation, or due to low gas densities implying low excitation. On average, our sample favours the latter scenario, suggesting that gas stabilization, feedback, or stripping are needed to keep galaxies quiescent, and that residual star formation alone cannot deplete the remaining molecular gas."}

In cosmological correlators, such a mixing is obtained by taking a folded limit of a generic tree graph, which is a special case of degenerate kinematics. In this work, we continue our exploration of massive inflationary amplitudes with a focus on degenerate kinematics. With a suitable change of variables, we derive new differential equations and full analytical solutions for generic tree graphs, making it trivial to take the folded limit and partial-energy limit at a vertex. Our result shows that folded tree graphs generally involve functions of smaller transcendental weights than their nondegenerate counterparts.

To achieve this, we utilized approximately 2 million spectroscopy pairwise combinations observed across different epochs for $\\sim90,000$ AGNs. We estimate the ensemble variability structure function (SF) for subsamples categorized by various AGN properties, such as black hole mass, AGN luminosity ($L$), and Eddington ratio, to investigate how AGN variability depends on these parameters. We found that the SFs are strongly correlated with $L$, Eddington ratio, and rest-frame wavelength ($λ$). The analysis, with each parameter held fixed, reveals that SFs depend primarily on $L$ and $λ$, but not on the Eddington ratio. Consequently, under the assumption that AGNs follow a universal SF, we found that the variability timescale ($τ$) is proportional to both $L$ and $λ$, expressed as $τ\\propto L^{0.62\\pm0.07} λ^{1.74\\pm0.23}$. This result is broadly consistent with predictions from the standard accretion disk model ($τ\\propto L^{0.5} λ^{2}$). However, when considering only shorter wavelengths ($λ\\leq 3050$ Å) to minimize contamination from the host galaxy and the Balmer continuum, the power-law index for $λ$ drops significantly to $1.12 \\pm 0.24$. This value is lower than predicted by approximately $3-$4\\ σ$, suggesting that the radial temperature profile may be systematically steeper than that predicted by the standard disk model, although other mechanisms may also contribute to this discrepancy. These findings highlight the power of temporal spectroscopic data in probing AGN variability, as they allow robust estimation of continuum fluxes without interference from strong emission lines."}

The resulting frequency-resolved maps recover strong 12CO(2-1) and 13CO(2-1) emission, and a continuum component whose spectral index discriminates free-free emission in the circumnuclear disk (CND) versus thermal dust emission in the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds.

We also show that assuming the galaxies populating our $z=0.9$ relations evolve into those populating the $z=0$ relations leads to an apparent discrepancy with the hierarchical growth of dark matter halos. To solve this issue, one needs to evoke a progenitor bias scenario, unknown systematics affecting our and previous measurements, or consider the possibility that H$α$ kinematics is not a reliable dynamical tracer."}

A crucial aspect of this analysis involves predicting stellar population parameters from the observed galaxy photometry. In this study, we combine the exquisite J-PAS photometry with state-of-the-art single stellar population (SSP) libraries to accurately predict stellar age, metallicity, and dust attenuation with a neural network (NN) model. The NN is trained on synthetic J-PAS photometry from different SSP librares (E-MILES, Charlot & Bruzual, XSL), to enhance the robustness of our predictions against individual SSP model variations and limitations. To create mock samples with varying observed magnitudes we add artificial noise in the form of random Gaussian variations within typical observational uncertainties in each band.

Extended version of the conference paper arXiv:2307.04994. Comments welcome", "summary": "The advent of increasingly advanced surveys and cosmic tracers has motivated the development of new inference techniques and novel approaches to extracting information from cosmic fields. A central challenge in this endeavor is to quantify the information content carried by these summary statistics in cosmic fields. In particular, how should we assess which statistics are more informative than others and assess the exact degree of complementarity of the information from each statistic? Here, we introduce mutual information (MI) that provides, from an information-theoretic perspective, a natural framework for assessing the sufficiency and complementarity of summary statistics in cosmological data. We demonstrate how MI can be applied to typical inference tasks to make information-theoretic evaluations, using two representative examples: the cosmic microwave background map, from which the power spectrum extracts almost all information as is expected for a Gaussian random field, and the 21~cm brightness temperature map, from which the scattering transform extracts the most non-Gaussian information but is complementary to power spectrum and bispectrum. Our results suggest that MI offers a robust theoretical foundation for evaluating and improving summaries, thereby enabling a deeper understanding of cosmic fields from an information-theoretic perspective."}

It is well known that the SM Higgs field features a deeper, more stable minimum at large field values. While it is possible that our Universe began and remained in the electroweak vacuum at all times, this scenario is extremely fine-tuned from the point of view of initial conditions. This fine-tuning can be ameliorated by the exponential expansion of spacetime during inflation: intriguingly, this requires at least $\\sim 40$ e-folds of inflation, tantalizingly close to the $50-60$ e-folds expected from horizon and flatness considerations. The Higgs could thus provide the reason for a prolonged epoch of inflation in our cosmic history. Otherwise, the most natural initial state corresponds to our Universe initialized in the more stable but \"wrong\" Higgs vacuum, and subsequently driven dynamically to the weak scale vacuum during reheating. An important, hitherto unexplored aspect of this dynamics is that the barrier between the two vacua persists when the electroweak vacuum becomes energetically favorable, becoming arbitrarily small as the temperature increases, and therefore triggers a first-order phase transition. This transition produces ultra-high (megahertz to gigahertz) frequency gravitational waves (GWs), serving as a challenging but unique SM target for GW experiments. Novel pathways for various beyond the Standard Model phenomena such as the production of dark matter and baryon asymmetry also become possible in this configuration."}

In this work, we present WATSON-Net, a new open-source neural network classifier and data preparation package designed to compete with current state-of-the-art tools for vetting and validation of transiting exoplanet signals from space-based missions.

For Kepler targets, WATSON-Net achieves a recall-at-precision of 0.99 (R@P0.99) of 0.903, ranking second, with only the ExoMiner network performing better (R@P0.99 = 0.936). For TESS signals, WATSON-Net emerges as the best-performing non-fine-tuned machine learning classifier, achieving a precision of 0.93 and a recall of 0.76 on a test set comprising confirmed planets and false positives.

To illustrate this idea, we consider a field-theoretic model of a three-form gauge field coupled to a cosmological fluid composed of ordinary matter and radiation. In the absence of interactions, the 3-form gauge theory describes only a global, non-propagating state, which can be associated with dark energy. However, when coupled to the cosmic fluid, the theory gives rise to an emergent, dynamical in-medium state. We identify this emergent state of the 3-form gauge field with dark matter. Thus, our proposal provides a unified framework for the dark sector of the universe within the context of an interacting three-form gauge theory. Furthermore, we speculate that the three-form field may have a gravitational origin, potentially supported by the lepton-number asymmetry in the primordial plasma. If this scenario is correct, conventional direct and indirect searches for dark matter would likely be futile."}

We used the photoionization code CLOUDY to generate synthetic spectra with the same spectral range and resolution, simulating a wide range of gas phases and abundances. We then determined the contribution of each phase to the spectra. Once the abundances and contribution from each phase of the gas were determined, we identified four dominant phases and performed a spatial analysis to determine their contribution to each spaxel of the datacubes. We find that in both the CND and the CC, the bulk of the emission originates from warm ionized gas with temperatures of between $10^4$ and $10^{4.8}$~K. In the CND, molecular gas contributes significantly to the flux and is spatially structured, while the CC shows minimal molecular gas content, as is expected from these regions. Coronal gas is detected in both regions at the interface between molecular and warm ionized gas. The observed abundance pattern (enhanced CNO and $α$ elements with suppressed Fe) indicates a chemically young environment, recently enriched by core-collapse supernovae and stellar winds, with a limited contribution from older Type Ia supernovae.

The nominal Roman Coronagraph observing plan involves alternating observations of a science target and a bright, nearby reference star. High contrast is achieved using wavefront sensing and control, also known as \"digging a dark hole\", where performance depends on the properties of the reference star, requiring V<3, a resolved stellar diameter <2 mas, and no stellar multiplicity. The imposed brightness and diameter criteria limit the sample of reference star candidates to high-mass main sequence and post-main sequence objects, where multiplicity rates are high. A future HWO coronagraph may have similarly restrictive criteria in reference star selection. From an exhaustive literature review of 95 stars, we identify an initial list of 40 primary and 18 reserve reference star candidates relevant to both the Roman Coronagraph and HWO. We present results from an initial survey of these candidates with high-resolution adaptive optics imaging and speckle interferometry and identify no new companions.

This embryo structure of LRDs ($M_{\\bullet}<\\mathscr{M}_{m_{\\bullet}}$) is formed as a consequence of gravitational collapse of primordial clouds. In this Chimera, accretion onto sMBHs powers the rest-frame optical continuum of the LRDs but the UV continuum is jointly contributed by slim parts of the cMBH-disks and nuclear starbursts in the core of collapsing clouds governing the appearance of the observed V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Outflowing clumped-envelopes are unavoidably formed by radiation pressure leading to absorption features of the Balmer lines. The present model works very well for LRDs' SEDs and avoids the issues of overly massive cMBHs. Evolution of LRDs is briefly discussed including gravitational waves."}

Launched in 2020, our project has made significant progress since then. These advancements have convinced us that a single-phase LHe TPC is technologically feasible. Compared to liquid xenon and liquid argon TPCs, one of the unique challenges for LHe TPCs is event overlap caused by the 13-second lifetime scintillation.

Formally, the conservation and gauge invariance of $I_H$ require the vanishing of certain boundary terms related to the strength of long-range spatial correlations. These boundary terms represent the ability (or otherwise) of the turbulence to organise fluxes over arbitrarily large distances to deplete or enhance fluctuations of magnetic helicity. In this work, we present a theory of these boundary terms, employing a methodology analogous to that of Batchelor & Proudman (1956, Philos. Trans. R. Soc. A 248, 369) to determine the relevant asymptotic forms of correlation functions. We find that long-range correlations of sufficient strength to violate the conservation of $I_H$ cannot develop dynamically if the evolution equation for the magnetic vector potential is chosen to be local in space. Likewise, we find that such correlations cannot develop for a wide class of gauge choices that make this equation non-local (including the Coulomb gauge). Nonetheless, we also identify a class of non-local gauge choices for which correlations that are sufficiently strong to violate the conservation of $I_H$ do appear possible. We verify our theoretical predictions for the case of the Coulomb gauge with measurements of correlation functions in a high-resolution numerical simulation."}

For sub-pc BBHs in BLAGN, two main characteristics on $α_{5100}$ can be expected. First, if a BLAGN harbours a central sub-pc BBH, the expected unique variability in $α_{5100}$ should lead the BLAGN to be an outlier in the space of $α_{5100}$ versus continuum luminosity $L_{5100}$ determined from normal BLAGN. Second, BLAGN harbouring central sub-pc BBHs could lead to periodic variations in $α_{5100}$. Here, after checking the two-epoch SDSS spectra of quasar SDSS J0012-1022 reported as a candidate of sub-pc BBH by large velocity offset between narrow and broad Balmer emission lines, unique variability of $α_{5100}$ can be explained by effects of obscurations related to an assumed central sub-pc BBH.

A crucial aspect of this analysis involves predicting stellar population parameters from the observed galaxy photometry. In this study, we combine the exquisite J-PAS photometry with state-of-the-art single stellar population (SSP) libraries to accurately predict stellar age, metallicity, and dust attenuation with a neural network (NN) model. The NN is trained on synthetic J-PAS photometry from different SSP librares (E-MILES, Charlot & Bruzual, XSL), to enhance the robustness of our predictions against individual SSP model variations and limitations. To create mock samples with varying observed magnitudes we add artificial noise in the form of random Gaussian variations within typical observational uncertainties in each band. Our results indicate that the NN can accurately estimate stellar parameters for SSP models without evident degeneracies, surpassing a bayesian SED-fitting method on the same test set.

Numerical or analytical models generally consider that the mass, momentum, and energy injections result from bursts in a nuclear star formation region. However, star formation bursts have recently been observed in ring-like regions in the nuclear part of the galaxies. One example is NGC 253, which has shown a central toroidal burst and an asymmetric galactic wind observed in thermal X-ray emission. The general aim of this work is to study the effect of mechanical energy injection from stellar winds and supernova explosions in star-forming bursts distributed in rings around the nucleus of the galaxy NGC 253. Additionally, these partial objectives allow us to analyze the asymmetry of the outflows due to the bursts position as well as to study the formation of filaments with optical emission and make comparisons with recent observations of galaxies with these types of star-forming bursts. We used the hydrodynamic code AMRVAC to simulate galactic wind ejection coming from a central ring-like starburst located at different vertical positions. We showed that including a ring-shaped starburst (RSS) generates a more complex structured wind than what would be expected for a spherical starburst injection. Besides the interaction between the wind generated by the RSS and the host galaxy, it can generate dense filamentary structures with H alpha emission. The mass flux analysis of our models shows that the variation in the vertical position of the starburst can generate a variation in the mass flux of each lobe of the wind up to an order of magnitude. However, this difference is sustained only for a short period, with the flux tending to be symmetrical once it enters into a free-wind solution."}

However, analyses based on time-division CMB maps are fundamentally limited by the mapmaking cadence, restricting sensitivity to frequencies below $\\sim 10^{-5}$ Hz. In this paper we develop a phase-folding mapmaking framework to enable targeted searches of such periodic cosmological signals with frequencies up to the detector sampling rate of $O(100)$ Hz. We demonstrate the power of this framework with two cosmological applications: (1) constraining a stochastic gravitational wave background via its time-dependent lensing signature, and (2) the search for an oscillating polarization rotation from axion-like particles. We show that this technique transforms CMB experiments into broadband probes of the oscillating sky, extending their constraining power from the microhertz regime up to $O(100)$ Hz-an expansion of over seven orders of magnitude in frequency. This provides a new observational window, complementary to other approaches by probing under-explored frequency ranges for gravitational waves and axion-like particles."}

We analize a complete sample of 13 gravity-selected clusters at intermediate redshifts (with $0.12 \\leq z_{phot} \\leq 0.40$) with weak-lensing signal-to-noise ratios exceeding 7. We measured cluster richness by counting red-sequence galaxies, identifying two cases of line-of-sight projections in the process, later confirmed by spectroscopic data. Both clusters are sufficiently separated in redshift that contamination in richness can be straighforwardly dealt because the two red sequences do not blend each other. We find an exceptionally tight richness--mass relation using our red-sequence-based richness estimator, with a scatter of just $\\sim0.05$ dex, smaller than the intrinsic scatter of Compton Y with mass for the same sample. The lower scatter highlights the effectiveness of richness compared to Compton $Y$. No outliers are found in the richness-mass scaling, whether or not one cluster with a mass likely affected by projection effects is included in the sample. In the Compton $Y$-richness plane, the data do not delineate a clear trend. The limited sample size is not the sole reason for the unclear relation between Compton $Y$ and richness, since the same sample, with identical richness values, exhibits a highly significant and tight mass-richness correlation."}

We assess the success of these theoretical proposals by implementing different statistical metrics and ranking them. The DM-$z$ relations are also tested using 100 realizations of 500 simulated FRBs, which follow the observed DM trends. Relying on our theoretical modeling, we establish the probability of $\\sim$1000 FRBs with unknown $z$ (from the latest CHIME data release) to be hosted by galaxies in the SDSS archival dataset.

Gravitational waves affect the path of radio pulses propagating from a pulsar to Earth, causing the arrival times of those pulses to deviate from expectations based on the physical characteristics of the pulsar system. By correlating these timing residuals in a pulsar timing array (PTA), one can search for a statistically isotropic background of gravitational waves by revealing evidence for a distinctive pattern predicted by General Relativity, known as the Hellings \\& Downs curve. On June 29 2023, five regional PTA collaborations announced the first evidence for GWs at light-year wavelengths, predicated on support for this correlation pattern with statistical significances ranging from $\\sim\\!2-4σ$. The amplitude and shape of the recovered GW spectrum has also allowed many investigations of the expected source characteristics, ranging from a cosmic population of supermassive binary black holes to numerous processes in the early Universe. In the future, we expect to resolve signals from individual binary systems of supermassive black holes, and probe fundamental assumptions about the background, including its polarization, anisotropy, Gaussianity, and stationarity, all of which will aid efforts to discriminate its origin.

Independent research project using public astronomical archives (DSS2, GALEX, 2MASS, ROSAT/XMM/Chandra) and open-source tools (Aladin, Python). Not peer-reviewed", "summary": "We study five nearby galaxies (M100/NGC 4321, NGC 1300, M 74, M 60, and NGC 7331) by combining multiband imaging (optical, UV, NIR, and X-rays) with simple photometric measurements to show how each spectral window traces different physical components: UV/blue emphasizes recent star formation, NIR outlines the old stellar mass and internal structure, and X-rays reveal compact sources and hot gas. For M100 we present a multiband mosaic with X-ray contours including the SN 1979C region. We compare isophotal morphology in NGC 1300 (barred) and M 74 (unbarred), quantify ellipticity and equivalent radius in M 60, and illustrate a Tully-Fisher distance estimate for NGC 7331, discussing assumptions (inclination, internal corrections) and consistency with classical scales. Our results underscore that a layered view reduces interpretative biases and that straightforward integrations of public data with open-source software yield robust introductory-level physical diagnostics."}
