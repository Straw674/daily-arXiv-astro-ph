### [1] [Ambipolar diffusion and the mass-to-flux ratio in a turbulent collapsing cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20391)
*Aris Tritsis*

**TL;DR**: 通过三维非理想磁流体动力学模拟研究了超临界湍流分子云坍缩中的中性-离子漂移速度和质量-磁通比的空间特征和时间演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 恒星形成受非理想磁流体动力学效应、重力和湍流的复杂相互作用支配，计算挑战阻碍了对这种相互作用的全面三维探索，成为理解云和核心的长期挑战。

Data: 使用了包含115种物种的非平衡化学网络自洽计算云的电阻率。

Method: 开发了一种新的广义方法来测量三维模拟中的真实质量-磁通比，并使用了不同带电物种的平均碰撞速率计算电阻率。

Result: 研究发现中性-离子漂移速度在早期遵循二维轴对称非理想磁流体动力学模拟的预期结构，后期变得复杂；真实质量-磁通比随时间单调增加，而观测到的质量-磁通比与真实值和云密度结构相关性较差。

Abstract: The formation of stars is governed by the intricate interplay of nonideal
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects, gravity, and turbulence. Computational
challenges have hindered a comprehensive 3D exploration of this interplay,
posing a longstanding challenge in our understanding of clouds and cores. Our
objective was to study the spatial features and time evolution of the
neutral-ion drift velocity and the mass-to-flux ratio in a 3D nonideal MHD
chemo-dynamical simulation of a supercritical turbulent collapsing molecular
cloud. The resistivities of the cloud were computed self-consistently from a
vast non-equilibrium chemical network containing 115 species. To compute the
resistivities we used different mean collisional rates for each charged species
in our network. We additionally developed a new generalized method for
measuring the true mass-to-flux ratio in 3D simulations. Despite the cloud's
turbulent nature, at early times, the neutral-ion drift velocity follows the
expected structure from 2D axisymmetric non-ideal MHD simulations with an
hourglass magnetic field. At later times, however, the neutral-ion drift
velocity becomes increasingly complex, with many vectors pointing outward from
the cloud's center. Specifically, we find that the drift velocity above and
below the cloud's ``midplane'' is in ``antiphase''. We explain these features
on the basis of magnetic helical loops and the correlation of the drift
velocity with the magnetic tension force per unit volume. Despite the complex
structure of the neutral-ion drift velocity, we demonstrate that, when averaged
over a region, the true mass-to-flux ratio monotonically increases as a
function of time and decreases as a function of the radius from the center of
the cloud. In contrast, the ``observed'' mass-to-flux ratio shows poor
correlation with the true mass-to-flux ratio and the density structure of the
cloud.

### [2] [Exploring the interplay of dust and gas phases in DustPedia star-forming galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20392)
*Francesco Salvestrini,Simone Bianchi,Edvige Corbelli*

**TL;DR**: This study explores the relationship between molecular gas, atomic gas, dust, and galaxy properties in nearby late-type galaxies, identifying scaling relations and proposing mid/far-IR luminosities as proxies for molecular gas mass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Molecular gas is crucial for star formation, and understanding its dependencies on galaxy properties is essential for galaxy evolution studies. Current correlations between molecular gas mass (M_H2), star formation rate (SFR), and stellar mass (M_star) exhibit large scatter, especially for galaxies with quenched star formation.

Data: The study uses CO maps for 121 galaxies from the DustPedia project to accurately determine the global molecular gas mass (M_H2).

Method: The research investigates scaling relations for M_H2 based on correlation strength and intrinsic dispersion, including a "fundamental plane" of star formation combining M_H2, M_star, and SFR. It also examines correlations between ISM components and monochromatic luminosities at different wavelengths.

Result: The study confirms that the total gas mass correlates tightly with dust mass, and molecular gas also shows a good correlation with dust. Mid and far-IR luminosities are proposed as reliable proxies for molecular gas mass, with mid-IR bands capturing PAH emission useful for tracing molecular gas and dust masses.

Abstract: Molecular gas is the key ingredient of the star formation cycle, and tracing
its dependencies on other galaxy properties is essential for understanding
galaxy evolution. In this work, we explore the relation between the different
phases of the interstellar medium (ISM), namely molecular gas, atomic gas, and
dust, and galaxy properties using a sample of nearby late-type galaxies. To
this goal, we collect CO maps for 121 galaxies from the DustPedia project,
ensuring an accurate determination of $M_{H2}$, the global molecular gas mass.
We investigate which scaling relations provide the best description of
$M_{H2}$, based on the strength of the correlation and its intrinsic
dispersion. Commonly used correlations between $M_{H2}$ and star formation rate
(SFR) and stellar mass ($M_{\star}$) are affected by large scatter, which
accounts for galaxies that are experiencing quenching of their star formation
activity. This issue can be partially mitigated by considering a "fundamental
plane" of star formation, fitting together $M_{H2}$, $M_{\star}$, and SFR. We
confirm previous results from the DustPedia collaboration that the total gas
mass has the tightest connection with the dust mass and that the molecular
component also establishes a good correlation with dust. Although dust grains
are necessary for the formation of hydrogen molecules, the strength of
gravitational potential driven by the stellar component plays a key role in
driving density enhancements and the atomic-to-molecular phase transition.
Eventually, we investigated the correlations between ISM components and
monochromatic luminosities at different wavelengths: we proposed mid and far-IR
luminosities as reliable proxies of $L^{\prime}_{CO}$ for sources lacking
dedicated millimeter observations. Luminosities in mid-IR photometric bands
collecting PAH emission can be used to trace molecular gas and dust masses.

### [3] [NEXUS: A Spectroscopic Census of Broad-line AGNs and Little Red Dots at $3\lesssim z\lesssim 6$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20393)
*Ming-Yang Zhuang,Junyao Li,Yue Shen,Xiaojing Lin,Alice E. Shapley,Feige Wang,Qiaoya Wu,Qian Yang*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过NIRCam/WFSS光谱观测，在红移3到6范围内发现了23个宽线活动星系核（BLAGNs），其中15个被归类为小红点（LRDs），并分析了它们的物理特性和空间分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前对高红移宽线活动星系核（BLAGNs）和小红点（LRDs）的研究仍存在不足，尤其是在红移3到6范围内的物理特性和空间分布方面。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Data: 使用了NEXUS调查中NIRCam/WFSS光谱仪在F322W2+F444W波段观测的中央100平方角分区域的数据。

Method: 通过光谱分析、黑体质量和爱丁顿比估计、以及小尺度聚类分析等方法进行研究。

Result: 研究发现LRDs的数量密度约为10的负5次方每立方共动兆秒差距，且在红移较低端有下降趋势；BLAGNs和LRDs的黑洞质量和爱丁顿比存在较大系统误差；LRDs的宿主星系贡献了显著的紫外辐射；聚类分析显示BLAGNs和LRDs在小尺度上可能存在过强的聚类效应。

Abstract: We present a spectroscopic sample of 23 broad-line AGNs (BLAGNs) at
$3\lesssim z\lesssim 6$ selected using F322W2+F444W NIRCam/WFSS grism
spectroscopy of the central 100 ${\rm arcmin^2}$ area of the NEXUS survey.
Among these BLAGNs, 15 are classified as Little Red Dots (LRDs) based on their
rest-frame UV-optical spectral slopes and compact morphology. The number
density of LRDs is $\sim 10^{-5}\,{\rm cMpc^{-3}}$, with a hint of declining
towards the lower end of the probed redshift range. These BLAGNs and LRDs span
broad H$\alpha$ luminosities of $\sim 10^{42.2}-10^{43.7}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$,
black hole masses of $\sim 10^{6.3}-10^{8.4}\,M_\odot$, and Eddington ratios of
$\sim 0.1-1$ (median value 0.4), though the black hole mass and Eddington ratio
estimates carry large systematic uncertainties. Half of the LRDs show strong
Balmer absorption, suggesting high-density gas surrounding the line-emitting
region. We detect extended (hundreds of parsec) rest-frame UV-optical emission
from the host galaxy in the majority of these LRDs, which contributes
significantly or even dominantly to their total UV emission. This host emission
largely accounts for the peculiar UV upturn of the LRD spectral energy
distribution. We also measure the small-scale ($\lesssim 1\,{\rm cMpc}$)
clustering of these BLAGNs and LRDs by cross-correlating with a photometric
galaxy sample. Extrapolating the power-law two-point correlation function model
to large linear scales, we infer a linear bias of $3.30_{-2.04}^{+2.88}$ and
typical halo masses of a few $\times 10^{11}\,h^{-1}M_\odot$ for BLAGNs at the
sample median redshift of $z\sim 4.5$. However, the inferred linear bias and
halo masses of LRDs, while formally consistent with those for BLAGNs at $\sim
1.5\sigma$, appear too large to be compatible with their space density,
suggesting LRDs may have strong excess clustering on small scales.

### [4] [Neutral gas phase distribution from HI morphology: phase separation with scattering spectra and variational autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20407)
*Minjie Lei,S. E. Clark,Rudy Morel,E. Allys,Iryna S. Butsky,Caleb Redshaw,Drummond B. Fielding*

**TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种基于数据驱动的方法，利用中性氢（HI）发射强度的空间形态结构，结合散射光谱统计和高斯混合变分自编码器模型，成功分离了冷中性介质（CNM）、暖中性介质（WNM）和噪声成分，揭示了HI形态与相结构之间的物理联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 中性氢（HI）的多相结构研究对于理解银河系的生命周期至关重要，但HI相分离是一个具有挑战性且约束不足的问题。目前，中性气体相的分布通常通过HI发射的谱线结构推断。

Data: 使用了GALFA-HI发射的二维通道图，覆盖高纬度（|b|>30度）区域的窄速度通道（Δv=3 km/s）。

Method: 结合散射光谱（SS）统计和高斯混合变分自编码器（VAE）模型，从HI发射强度的多尺度形态结构中提取不同HI相的统计模型，并用于分解HI发射图。

Result: 成功分离了CNM、WNM和噪声成分，发现CNM图与现有基于光谱方法生成的图高度相关，但新方法在小尺度上恢复了更多空间相干结构。研究揭示了HI形态与相结构之间的物理联系，为未来结合HI光谱和空间信息的3D PPV空间分解提供了新途径。

Abstract: Unraveling the multi-phase structure of the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM)
as traced by neutral hydrogen (HI) is essential to understanding the lifecycle
of the Milky Way. However, HI phase separation is a challenging and
under-constrained problem. The neutral gas phase distribution is often inferred
from the spectral line structure of HI emission. In this work, we develop a
data-driven phase separation method that extracts HI phase structure solely
from the spatial morphology of HI emission intensity structures. We combine
scattering spectra (SS) statistics with a Gaussian-mixture variational
autoencoder (VAE) model to: 1. derive an interpretable statistical model of
different HI phases from their multi-scale morphological structures; 2. use
this model to decompose the 2D channel maps of GALFA-HI emission in diffuse
high latitude ($|b|>30$\degree) regions over narrow velocity channels ($\Delta
v=3$ km/s) into cold neutral medium (CNM), warm neutral medium (WNM), and noise
components. We integrate our CNM map over velocity channels to compare it to an
existing map produced by a spectrum-based method, and find that the two maps
are highly correlated, while ours recovers more spatially coherent structures
at small scales. Our work illustrates and quantifies a clear physical
connection between the HI morphology and HI phase structure, and unlocks a new
avenue for improving future phase separation techniques by making use of both
HI spectral and spatial information to decompose HI in 3D
position-position-velocity (PPV) space. These results are consistent with a
physical picture where processes that drive HI phase transitions also shape the
morphology of HI gas, imprinting a sparse, filamentary CNM that forms out of a
diffuse, extended WNM.

**TL;DR**: 研究通过DESI One-Percent Survey测量了发射线星系（ELGs）的投影两点相关函数，并建模了其对恒星质量和[OII]光度的依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域关注发射线星系（ELGs）的聚类特性及其与恒星质量和[OII]光度的关系，但现有研究在测量不确定性和红移依赖性方面存在不足。

Data: 使用了DESI One-Percent Survey中约180,000个红移在0.8到1.6之间的ELGs数据。

Method: 通过定义27个样本并根据红移、恒星质量和[OII]光度进行切割，采用描述[OII]光度-恒星质量分布随晕质量变化的框架，同时建模所有样本的聚类测量。

Result: 研究发现大多数ELGs是中心星系，位于窄质量范围的晕中（典型中值约为10的12.2-12.4次方h逆M太阳质量），恒星质量对聚类振幅的依赖性较弱，而高红移（1.2 < z < 1.6）下[OII]光度与星系偏差之间存在趋势。

Abstract: We measure the projected two-point correlation functions of emission line
galaxies (ELGs) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)
One-Percent Survey and model their dependence on stellar mass and [OII]
luminosity. We select $\sim$180,000 ELGs with redshifts of $0.8 < z < 1.6$ and
define 27 samples according to cuts in redshift and both galaxy properties.
Following a framework that describes the conditional [OII] luminosity-stellar
mass distribution as a function of halo mass, we simultaneously model the
clustering measurements of all samples at fixed redshift. Based on the modeling
result, most ELGs in our samples are classified as central galaxies, residing
in halos of a narrow mass range with a typical median of $\sim$10$^{12.2-12.4}$
$h^{-1} M_\odot$. We observe a weak dependence of clustering amplitude on
stellar mass, which is reflected in the model constraints and is likely a
consequence of the 0.5-dex measurement uncertainty in the stellar mass
estimates. The model shows a trend between galaxy bias and [OII] luminosity at
high redshift ($1.2 < z < 1.6$) that is otherwise absent at lower redshifts.

**TL;DR**: 研究通过NBODY6++GPU模拟揭示了初始旋转对含原始双星的星团早期演化的显著影响，包括角动量传输和形态变化，并提供了与未来观测对比的合成数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 年轻星团可以从其形成的分子云中继承整体旋转，这种旋转可能影响星团的长期演化及其恒星组成。目前研究旨在表征不同初始旋转程度对含原始双星星团的影响。

Data: 模拟数据通过NBODY6++GPU生成。

Method: 使用NBODY6++GPU进行数值模拟，研究初始旋转对星团演化的影响。

Result: 初始旋转强烈影响星团的早期演化，快速旋转的星团表现出角动量从内部向外传输，导致核心坍缩，并形成高度拉长的棒状结构。旋转和非旋转星团在潮汐场作用下分别经历角动量方向的变化。研究还提供了与未来Gaia、CSST和HST观测对比的合成数据。

Abstract: Young star clusters can inherit bulk rotation from the molecular clouds from
which they have formed. This rotation can affect the long-term evolution of a
star cluster and its constituent stellar populations. In this study, we aim to
characterize the effects of different degrees of initial rotation on star
clusters with primordial binaries. The simulations are performed using
NBODY6++GPU. We find that initial rotation strongly affects the early evolution
of star clusters. Rapidly rotating clusters show angular momentum transport
from the inner parts to the outskirts, resulting in a core collapse. Angular
momentum transport is accompanied by a highly elongated bar-like structure
morphology. The effects of bulk rotation are reduced on the timescale of
two-body relaxation. Rotating and non-rotating clusters experience changes in
the direction of angular momentum near the dissolution and early evolution due
to the tidal field, respectively. We present synthetic observations of
simulated clusters for comparison with future observations in filters of Gaia,
CSST, and HST. This work shows the effects of bulk rotation on systems with
primordial binaries and could be used for the identification of rotation
signatures in observed open clusters.

### [7] [Gaseous Dynamical Friction on Hyperbolic Scatterings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20470)
*David O'Neill,Daniel J. D'Orazio,Martin E. Pessah*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过线性扰动理论分析了均匀气体介质中质量相等的双曲线相遇，揭示了气体对轨道能量、角动量及拱点进动的影响，并识别了六种不同的轨道类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域关注气体介质中天体相遇的动力学效应，但现有研究对双曲线轨道中气体对轨道参数的具体影响尚未充分探索。

Data: 研究使用了均匀气体介质中的双曲线相遇数据。

Method: 采用线性扰动理论计算了密度尾迹及其对轨道参数的影响。

Result: 研究发现气体总是耗散轨道能量，导致半长轴减小和近心点马赫数增加；轨道角动量可能增减，而轨道偏心率通常被阻尼，促进了超音速气体捕获。此外，气体施加的力并非严格摩擦性，与现有理论预测的瞬时力显著不同。

Abstract: We present a study of equal-mass hyperbolic encounters, embedded in a uniform
gaseous medium. Using linear perturbation theory, we calculate the density
wakes excited by these perturbers and compute the resulting forces exerted on
them by the gas. We compute the changes to orbital energy, orbital angular
momentum and apsidal precession across a wide range of eccentrities and
pericenter Mach numbers. We identify six distinct classes of hyperbolic orbits,
differing through their wake structure and subsequent orbital evolution. We
find the gas to always dissipate orbital energy, leading to smaller semi-major
axes and higher pericenter Mach numbers. The orbital angular momentum can
either increase or decrease, whereas we typically find the orbital eccentricity
to be damped, promoting supersonic gas-captures. Additionally, we find that the
force exerted by the gas is not strictly frictional -- particularly for
asymptotically subsonic trajectories. Therefore, despite the orbit-integrated
changes to orbital parameters being similar to those predicted by the
\cite{O99} prescription, the time evolution of the density wakes and the
instantaneous forces exerted on the perturbers are significantly different.

*Hyein Yoon,O. Ivy Wong,Aeree Chung,Shan Huang*

**TL;DR**: 研究分析了Virgo星系团周围大尺度纤维结构和星系群中星系的恒星形成和中性氢气体特性，揭示了低密度环境中星系在进入高密度区域前的预处理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究旨在理解星系在进入高密度区域（如Virgo星系团）之前，如何在低密度环境中被处理。当前研究关注星系在低密度环境中的恒星形成和中性氢气体特性。

Data: 研究使用了Virgo星系团周围三个大尺度纤维结构和两个星系群中星系的空间分布和多波段颜色数据（如W3-W1、NUV-r和g-r）。

Method: 通过分析星系的空间分布和多波段颜色数据，结合中性氢气体含量，研究了星系的恒星形成和气体特性。

Result: 研究发现，大部分星系呈现蓝色，表明恒星形成正常或增强，但某些纤维结构和星系群中存在显著比例的红色星系（32%和20%），表明恒星形成在低密度环境中已被抑制。此外，部分星系的中性氢气体含量较低，类似于星系团中的星系，但整体上中性氢缺乏的星系比例不如红色星系比例高，表明低密度环境中气体特性受环境影响较小。某些红色星系可能已在进入Virgo星系团前被预处理。

Abstract: We investigate the star formation and neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) gas
properties of galaxies along three large-scale filaments and two galaxy groups
in the wide field around the Virgo cluster. Our goal is to understand how
galaxies are processed in low-density environments before falling into
high-density regions. Combining the spatial distribution of galaxies with
multiwavelength colors such as W3-W1, NUV-r, and g-r, we find a predominance of
blue galaxies across the structures, indicating normal-to-enhanced star
formation, similar to that of isolated galaxies. However, one filament and one
group show a significant number of red galaxies (32% and 20%, respectively),
suggesting that star formation has been suppressed in low-density environments
before reaching high-density regions. Intriguingly, these red galaxies span a
wide range of stellar masses, and the presence of red dwarfs support that not
only mass but also environment plays an important role in the quenching of star
formation in cluster outskirts. One particular filament, potentially connected
to Virgo, already has a group of red populations outside Virgo's R_200, making
these galaxies good candidates for being "preprocessed" before entering the
Virgo cluster. In addition, several galaxies in the filaments and groups
possess relatively low HI gas contents, similar to cluster galaxies. However,
the overall fraction of HI-deficient galaxies is not as significantly high as
the fraction of red galaxies in these structures. This suggests that HI gas
properties are less influenced by the environment than star formation
properties in low-density regions, possibly due to gas replenishment through
accretion.

*Shaohua Zhang,Yuchong Luo,Shangchun Xie,Chao Gao,Zhijian Luo,Chenggang Shu,Hubing Xiao*

**TL;DR**: A systematic study of quasar-associated 2175 Å dust absorbers using SDSS DR16 data reveals insights into dust properties and their evolution in quasar environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The study addresses the properties and origins of dust absorbers in quasar environments, highlighting gaps in understanding dust composition and evolution influenced by factors like metallicity and radiation fields.

Data: Spectroscopic data from SDSS DR16, including optical spectra and multi-band magnitudes of 557,674 quasars in the redshift range 0.7 ≤ z ≤ 2.4.

Method: Analysis of quasar spectra and magnitudes to identify and characterize 843 dust absorbers, comparing their properties to known extinction curves like those of the LMC.

Result: Identified 843 dust absorbers with weak bump strengths and narrow widths, showing similarities to LMC extinction curves but with a shallower slope; found a negative correlation between bump strength and redshift, suggesting dust property evolution.

Abstract: We present, for the first time, a systematic study of quasar-associated 2175
\AA\ dust absorbers using spectroscopic data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) Data Release 16 (DR16). By analyzing the optical spectra and multi-band
magnitudes of 557,674 quasars in the redshift range of $0.7 \le z \le 2.4$, we
identify 843 absorbers that share the same redshifts as quasars and are
believed to originate from dust in the quasar nuclei, the host galaxies, or
their surrounding environments. These absorbers exhibit weak bump strengths
($A\rm_{bump}=0.49\pm0.15~\mu m^{-1}$) and narrow widths
($\gamma\rm=0.81\pm0.14~\mu m^{-1}$), while their peak positions span a broad
range from $x_0 = 4.2$ to $4.84~ \mu m^{-1}$. Their average extinction curves
resemble those of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) but exhibit a shallower
slope. In broad absorption line (BAL) quasars, the absorption bumps show
systematic shifts in peak positions. Although further confirmation is needed,
this may suggest environmental differences in dust grain properties. We find a
statistically significant negative correlation between bump strength and
redshift, suggesting possible evolution in dust properties. These findings
highlight the changing composition and physical conditions of dust in quasar
environments, likely influenced by factors such as metallicity, radiation
fields, and dust processing mechanisms. Future studies incorporating
ultraviolet and infrared data will be essential for refining the dust evolution
models. Machine learning techniques and high-resolution spectroscopic
follow-ups could enhance sample completeness and provide deeper insights into
the chemical properties of the dust absorbers.

*Gu Ying,Zheng Qi,Cheng Peizheng,Li Xiao,Xing-Qian Cheng,Zhang XueGuang,Liang EnWei*

**TL;DR**: 通过分析SDSS J2334的光变曲线和光谱数据，发现其可能是一个真正的2型活动星系核（TT2AGN）候选体，且中心黑洞附近存在潮汐撕裂事件（TDE）的证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 目前对活动星系核（AGN）的分类通常基于光谱中是否存在宽发射线，但真正的2型AGN（TT2AGN）是否存在隐藏的宽线区仍存在争议。本研究通过潮汐撕裂事件（TDE）的变异性特征，探索了一种新的方法来识别TT2AGN。

Data: 使用了SDSS J2334的20年光学光变曲线数据，以及来自不同巡天项目的光谱数据。

Method: 通过分析光变曲线拟合TDE模型，结合BPT图确认AGN活动，并通过比较宽线区假设下的黑洞质量与M-sigma关系预测的黑洞质量，排除了宽发射线的存在。

Result: SDSS J2334被确认为一个潜在的TT2AGN候选体，其中心黑洞附近存在TDE的证据，且光谱中仅显示窄发射线，支持其为真正的2型AGN。

Abstract: In this manuscript, through applications of TDE (tidal disruption event)
expected variability properties, a potential candidate for True type-2 AGN
without hidden central broad line regions (=TT2AGN) is reported in the SDSS
J233454.07+145712.9 (=SDSS J2334). Through analyzing the 20-years optical light
curves of SDSS J2334 from different Sky Survey projects, a TDE is preferred
with a $4.7{\rm M_\odot}$ main-sequence star tidally disrupted by the central
BH with mass $11.7\times 10^6{\rm M_\odot}$, indicating that central region
within distance about 20 light-days to central BH in SDSS J2334 is directly in
the line-of-sight. Moreover, AGN activities in SDSS J2334 can be confirmed
through applications of BPT diagrams. Meanwhile, comparing virial BH mass
determined through assumed broad Balmer emission components and M-sigma
expected BH mass by well measured stellar velocity dispersion through stellar
absorption features, optical broad emission lines in SDSS J2334 are disfavored
with confidence level higher than 6$\sigma$. Therefore, combining the unique
properties of the TDE and the spectroscopic results with only narrow emission
lines, SDSS J2334 can be well identified as a potential candidate for a TT2AGN.
The results indicate the to detect TDE expected flares in normal Type-2 AGN
classified by spectroscopic results should be a new practicable method for
identifying

*Rui Zhang,Xiaotong Guo,Qiusheng Gu,Guanwen Fang,Jun Xu,Hai-Cheng Feng,Yongyun Chen,Rui Li,Nan Ding,Hongtao Wang*

**TL;DR**: 研究者使用随机森林算法在Chandra Deep Field-South (CDFS)中成功识别出67个新的Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (CT-AGNs)，显著提高了CT-AGNs的比例，并发现其宿主星系具有更高的恒星形成活动水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (CT-AGNs)因其高柱密度（NH ≥ 1.5 × 10^24 cm^-2）而发射微弱的X射线辐射，甚至难以被X射线仪器探测到。尽管CT-AGNs被认为是宇宙X射线背景（CXB）的重要贡献者，但目前在CDFS中仅识别出约11%的AGNs为CT-AGNs，远低于理论预测的30%或更高比例。

Data: 研究使用了210个AGNs的安全分类子集来训练和评估随机森林算法，并进一步应用于254个AGNs的子集。

Method: 研究者采用了随机森林算法来识别CT-AGNs，并在训练集上达到了90%的准确率。

Result: 研究成功识别出67个新的CT-AGNs，显著提高了CDFS中CT-AGNs的比例，使其更接近CXB的理论预测值。此外，研究发现CT-AGNs的宿主星系表现出更高的恒星形成活动水平。

Abstract: Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (CT-AGNs), which are defined by column
density $\mathrm{N_H} \geqslant 1.5 \times 10^{24} \ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, emit
feeble X-ray radiation, even undetectable by X-ray instruments. Despite this,
the X-ray emissions from CT-AGNs are believed to be a substantial contributor
to the cosmic X-ray background (CXB). According to synthesis models of AGNs,
CT-AGNs are expected to make up a significant fraction of the AGN population,
likely around 30% or more. However, only $\sim$11% of AGNs have been identified
as CT-AGNs in the Chandra Deep Field-South (CDFS). To identify hitherto unknown
CT-AGNs in the field, we used a Random Forest algorithm for identifying them.
First, we build a secure classified subset of 210 AGNs to train and evaluate
our algorithm. Our algorithm achieved an accuracy rate of 90% on the test set
after training. Then, we applied our algorithm to an additional subset of 254
AGNs, successfully identifying 67 CT-AGNs within this group. This result
significantly increased the fraction of CT-AGNs in the CDFS, which is closer to
the theoretical predictions of the CXB. Finally, we compared the properties of
host galaxies between CT-AGNs and non-CT-AGNs and found that the host galaxies
of CT-AGNs exhibit higher levels of star formation activity.

### [12] [The MUSE view of ram pressure stripped galaxies in clusters: the GASP sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21107)

**TL;DR**: GASP survey利用VLT/MUSE观测了39个星系团中的76个星系，发现89%的候选剥离星系确实受到冲压剥离作用，并揭示了不同剥离阶段的分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系团中的冲压剥离（ram pressure stripping）是研究星系演化的重要机制，但现有研究在样本选择和剥离阶段分类上存在不足。

Data: 39个星系团中的76个星系，包括64个候选剥离星系和12个对照样本（恒星形成和被动星系）。

Method: 基于VLT/MUSE的空间分辨电离气体和恒星动力学数据，评估气体不对称性的物理起源。

Result: 89%的候选剥离星系被确认受到冲压剥离作用，且剥离星系被分类为不同剥离阶段；还发现对照样本中的3个恒星形成星系也显示出冲压剥离迹象。

Abstract: We present the full sample of 76 galaxies in 39 galaxy cluster fields at
z=0.04-0.07 observed with VLT/MUSE by the GASP survey. Most of them (64) were
observed as possible ram pressure stripped galaxies (stripping candidates)
based on optical B-band images, while the remaining 12 were a control sample of
both star-forming and passive galaxies. Based on spatially resolved ionized gas
and stellar kinematics, we assess the physical origin of the gas asymmetries
and find that 89% of the stripping candidates are confirmed by the VLT/MUSE
data. In addition, also 3 of the 4 star-forming galaxies in the control sample
show signs of ram pressure. These control galaxies display a ring of unusual
emission line ratios, which we see also in field galaxies, possibly originating
from the interaction with a hotter surrounding medium. The stripped galaxies
are classified into various classes corresponding to different degrees of
stripping, from weakest stripping to strong and extreme (jellyfish galaxies)
stripping, as well as truncated gas disks with gas left only in the galaxy
center. Our results show that selecting cluster stripping candidates based on
optical imaging yields a sample that is indeed largely dominated by galaxies
affected by ram pressure at different stages and stripping strength, though
some contamination is present, mostly by tidal processes. Strong ram pressure
cases are found in galaxies over the whole range of stellar masses studied
(10^9-10^11.5 Msun) both in low-mass and high-mass clusters (cluster velocity
dispersions sigma = 500-1100 km/s). We examine the possible connection between
the progressive stages of stripping, up to the phase of a truncated gas disk,
and the subsequent complete stripping of gas. We discuss the incompleteness
intrinsic to this and other methods of selection to obtain a complete census of
ram pressure stripping in clusters.

*Eva Sextl,Rolf-Peter Kudritzki,Fabio Bresolin,Kathryn Grasha,Hye-Jin Park,Qian-Hui Chen,Andrew J. Battisti,Mark Seibert,Barry F. Madore,Jeffrey A. Rich*

**TL;DR**: 通过种群合成技术分析M83星系的TYPHOON长缝光谱，揭示了年轻和年老星族金属丰度的空间分布、尘埃分布以及恒星形成率，并首次实现了全光谱拟合与年轻恒星探针金属丰度的空间一对一比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: M83是一个星暴棒旋星系，研究其尘埃分布、恒星形成率、年龄和金属丰度有助于理解星系化学演化和星际介质特性。现有研究缺乏对年轻和年老星族金属丰度的空间一对一比较。

Data: 使用了TYPHOON长缝光谱数据，覆盖M83星系中心5角分边长的区域。

Method: 应用种群合成技术分析光谱数据，通过红化和消光分析确定尘埃分布，并结合全光谱拟合技术和年轻恒星探针（如蓝超巨星、年轻大质量星团和超级星团）进行金属丰度比较。

Result: 研究发现年轻星族的金属丰度超太阳且无径向梯度，但在星系中心狭窄区域出现金属丰度下降；确认了中心附近260 pc直径的尘埃空洞，并发现尘埃吸收与分子CO发射的空间相关性以及RV与光解区域分子发射强度的反相关性。

Abstract: We apply population synthesis techniques to analyze TYPHOON long slit spectra
of the starburst barred spiral galaxy M83. The analysis covers a central square
of 5 arcmin side length. We determine the spatial distribution of dust through
the analysis of reddening and extinction, together with star formation rates,
ages, and metallicities of young and old stellar populations. For the first
time, a spatial one-to-one comparison of metallicities derived from
full-spectral fitting techniques with those obtained from individual young
stellar probes has been carried out. The comparison with blue supergiant stars,
young massive star clusters, and super star clusters shows a high degree of
concordance when wavelength coverage in the $B$-band is available. The
metallicity of the young population is supersolar and does not show a radial
metallicity gradient along the investigated part of the disk, in agreement with
our chemical evolution model. However, a notable decrease in metallicity is
observed in a tightly confined region at the galaxy center, coinciding with
circumnuclear orbits. We attribute this to matter infall either from the
circumgalactic medium or a dwarf galaxy interloper or, alternatively, to
AGN-interrupted chemical evolution. We confirm the presence of a dust cavity
with a diameter of 260~pc close to the galaxy center. Dust absorption and
molecular CO emission are spatially well correlated. We find an anticorrelation
between R$_V$, the ratio of dust attenuation to reddening, and the emission
strength of molecular species present in photo-dissociation regions. We confirm
our results by using alternative fitting algorithms and stellar libraries.

*Heinrich Steigerwald*

**TL;DR**: 该研究提出了一个结合理论和经验关系的框架，用于估算星系中暗物质诱导的瞬变事件率，并应用于暗物质以原始黑洞形式存在的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 暗物质（DM）的直接探测实验一直未能成功，近年来，研究转向通过暗物质穿越或积累在恒星中产生的非引力信号来识别暗物质。然而，如果这些信号导致宿主恒星毁灭，高暗物质密度区域的恒星数量可能在宇宙时间内减少，除非通过恒星形成补充。因此，需要结合星系恒星形成历史来推导暗物质诱导的瞬变事件率。

Data: 研究使用了星系结构、恒星形成和恒星初始质量函数的理论和经验标度关系。

Method: 研究结合理论和经验标度关系，构建了一个简单高效的框架，用于估算星系中目标恒星形成率和质量函数随星系恒星质量和宇宙时间的变化。

Result: 该框架被应用于假设暗物质以原始黑洞形式存在时，与白矮星碰撞引发正常Ia型超新星的场景，具体应用将在后续论文中展示。

Abstract: The dark matter (DM) conundrum is one of the most intriguing due to its
resistance in direct detection experiments. In recent years, attempts to
identify non-gravitational signatures as the result of DM traversing or
accumulating within stars have attracted a lot of attention. These calculations
are usually evaluated at the order-of-magnitude level for stellar populations
where the DM density is highest, such as galactic centers. However, if the
signature implies the destruction of the host star, their population could have
been diminished over a Hubble time in the most DM-dense regions, unless
replenished by star formation. This circumstance exemplifies the need for
galactic star formation history profiles when deriving DM-induced transient
rates, in particular for predicting the host-offset distribution. Here, we
combine theoretical and empirical scaling relations of galaxy structure, star
formation, and stellar initial mass function to construct a simple and
efficient framework that permits us to estimate the target population formation
rate and mass function within galactocentric radial zones across galaxy stellar
masses and cosmic time. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to the
hypothesis that DM in the form of primordial black holes accounts for the
ignition of normal type Ia supernovae when colliding with white dwarf stars.

**TL;DR**: 通过更新辐射和碰撞数据，研究星际C2分子的高激发态观测，提出化学激发机制解释观测结果，并建议使用完整的PDR模型进一步研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 最近的 spectroscopic 测量揭示了C2分子比以往观测更高的旋转能级吸收，同时伴随更新的辐射和碰撞数据的可用性。

Data: 观测到的C2分子的多个旋转能级数据。

Method: 构建了一个无空间结构的C2激发模型，包括高达J=34的能级，引入了更新的辐射和碰撞激发数据以及化学形成激发。

Result: 确认了C2与H2分子碰撞激发速率系数的重要性，提出化学激发机制解释高激发态观测，并建议使用完整的PDR模型进一步研究。

Abstract: Context. Recent spectroscopic measurements have revealed absorption from
higher rotational levels in C$_2$ than previous observations. These
improvements are accompanied by the availability of updated radiative and
collisional data. Aims. We revisit the density and radiation field intensity
diagnostics provided by the observations of many rotational levels of inter-
stellar C$_2$ and extensive molecular information. Methods. We built an
excitation model of C2 without spatial structure, including levels up to J= 34
where updated radiative and collisional excitation data are introduced as well
as excitation by chemical formation. Results. We confirm the importance of the
recent collisional excitation rate coefficients of C$_2$ by molecular H$_2$. We
show that the new higher level observations cannot be explained by the standard
balance between collisional excitation and radiative transitions. We propose
that chemical excitation at formation provides a plausible mechanism to explain
the observed high excitation of C$_2$. In addition, it allows us to lift the
degeneracy of the density over radiation field strength parameter in the
excitation model. Conclusions. A 0D model remains limited and it is highly
desirable to use a full Photon Dominated Region (PDR) model, which includes all
excitation processes introduced here and full chemical and thermal balance.

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过分析七颗0/I类原恒星系统中CH3OH和CH3CN的同位素比例，揭示了在恒星和行星形成过程中12C/13C比值的演化特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 尽管12C/13C同位素比值已在冷云（20-50 K）和一些原行星盘及系外行星大气中测得，但在年轻低质量原恒星周围的热气体（>100 K）中直接测量该比值的研究仍然稀缺，这对于研究恒星和行星形成过程中的演化至关重要。

Data: 研究使用了PRODIGE大型项目中NOEMA在1mm波段采集的数据，分析了CH3OH和CH3CN的发射谱线。

Method: 通过LTE（局部热力学平衡）分析，计算了12C和13C同位素分子的柱密度比值，并结合天体化学模型对结果进行了比较和解释。

Result: 研究发现12C/13C比值范围为4至30，显著低于预期的局部星际介质比值（约68），表明在早期原恒星阶段，COMs中13C的富集可能继承自其前体物种，且这种低比值可能在后续演化阶段部分保留。

Abstract: The 12C/13C isotope ratio has been derived towards numerous cold clouds
(20-50 K) and a couple protoplanetary disks and exoplanet atmospheres. However,
direct measurements of this ratio in the warm gas (>100 K) around young
low-mass protostars remain scarce, but are required to study its evolution
during star and planet formation. We derived 12C/13C ratios from the
isotopologues of the complex organic molecules (COMs) CH3OH and CH3CN in the
warm gas towards seven Class 0/I protostellar systems to improve our
understanding of the evolution of the 12C/13C ratios during star and planet
formation. We used the data that were taken as part of the PRODIGE large
program with the NOEMA at 1mm. The emission of CH3OH and CH3CN is spatially
unresolved in the PRODIGE data (300au scale). Derived rotational temperatures
exceed 100K, telling us that they trace the gas of the hot corino, where CH3CN
probes hotter regions than CH3OH on average (290 K versus 180 K). The column
density ratios between the 12C and 13C isotopologues, derived from LTE
analysis, range from 4 to 30, thus, are significantly lower than the expected
local ISM isotope ratio of about 68. Assuming that CH3CN and CH3OH may inherit
the 12C/13C ratio from their precursor species, astrochemical models were
conducted for the latter and compared with our observational results. We
conclude that an enrichment in 13C in COMs at the earliest protostellar stages
is likely inherited from the COMs' precursor species, whose 12C/13C ratios are
set during the prestellar stage via isotopic exchange reactions. This also
implies that low 12C/13C ratios observed at later evolutionary stages could at
least partially be inherited. A final conclusion on 12C/13C ratios in
protostellar environments requires improved observations to tackle current
observational limitations and additional modelling efforts.

**TL;DR**: 利用HST成像和MUSE积分视场单元数据，研究发现碰撞环星系AM0644-741中心存在一个特殊的恒星结构，揭示了其内部动力学状态和可能的AGN活动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 碰撞环星系AM0644-741的中心区域存在一个特殊的恒星结构，但其动力学状态和形成机制尚不明确。

Data: HST F814W波段光学图像和MUSE积分视场单元数据。

Method: 使用Galfit拟合Sérsic成分，利用GIST管道构建恒星视线速度、速度弥散、速度矩和恒星年龄分布图。

Result: 发现内部成分存在旋转恒星结构，速度弥散较高，且与外部成分的位置角相差约60度，表明近期碰撞对内部恒星轨道影响较小，但影响了外部盘的形成。此外，核源显示出LINER型电离，暗示AGN活动。

Abstract: We present the discovery of a peculiar central stellar structure in the
collisional ring galaxy AM0644-741 using HST imaging and MUSE integral field
unit (IFU) data. We identified two S\'ersic components with a S\'ersic index of
1.72 (inner part) and 1.11 (outer part) in the HST F814W band optical image
using \textsc{Galfit}. We utilized the MUSE data cube to construct stellar line
of sight velocity (V$_{\rm LOS}$), velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm LOS}$),
h$_3$ \& h$_4$ velocity moments, and stellar population age maps using the
\textsc{GIST} pipeline for further investigating both S\'ersic components,
which have a difference of $\sim$ 60 degrees in their position angle. The inner
component, with an effective radius $\sim$1 kpc, shows a strong anticorrelation
between V$_{\rm LOS}$/$\sigma_{\rm LOS}$ and h$_3$, indicating the presence of
a rotating stellar structure. In addition, the inner component also shows a
relatively higher velocity dispersion (average values reaching up to $\sim$240
km sec$^{-1}$) along with disky isophotes and stronger Mg~$b$ line strength,
which all together highlight a peculiar dynamical state of AM0644-741's central
region. Our analysis suggests that the recent encounter has had a smaller
impact on the stellar orbits within the inner component. In contrast, it has
specifically affected the stellar orbits of the progenitor's outer disk when
forming the star-forming ring. The BPT analysis of the unresolved nuclear
source shows a LINER-type ionization, hinting at AGN activity in the galaxy.
Our study projects the dynamical evolution of collisional systems and provides
scope for simulations to explore the central region in greater detail.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 第三星族恒星（Pop III）是宇宙早期由原始气体形成的第一代恒星，对宇宙再电离、早期化学富集和第一批星系的形成具有重要影响，但由于其寿命短和高红移特性，至今未被直接观测到。JWST的发射为通过强引力透镜放大观测这些恒星提供了机会。

Data: 本研究使用了JWST的波段和星等限制数据。

Method: 研究扩展了之前对非旋转、零龄主序星（ZAMS）Pop III恒星光谱特性的计算，加入了恒星旋转和后ZAMS演化的影响。

Result: 研究发现，虽然旋转在ZAMS阶段对可观测性影响不大，但后续演化会显著增亮恒星，使得质量最大的恒星在适度透镜条件下可能被观测到。

Abstract: Population III (Pop III) stars, the first generation of stars formed from
primordial gas, played a fundamental role in shaping the early universe through
their influence on cosmic reionization, early chemical enrichment, and the
formation of the first galaxies. However, to date they have eluded direct
detection due to their short lifetimes and high redshifts. The launch of the
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revolutionized observational
capabilities, providing the opportunity to detect Pop~III stars via caustic
lensing, where strong gravitational lensing magnifies individual stars to
observable levels. This prospect makes it compelling to develop accurate models
for their spectral characteristics to distinguish them from other stellar
populations. Previous studies have focused on computing the spectral properties
of non-rotating, zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) Pop III stars. In this work, we
expand upon these efforts by incorporating the effects of stellar rotation and
post-ZAMS evolution into spectral calculations. We use the JWST bands and
magnitude limits to identify the optimal observing conditions, both for
isolated stars, as well as for small star clusters. We find that, while
rotation does not appreciably change the observability at ZAMS, the subsequent
evolution can significantly brighten the stars, making the most massive ones
potentially visible with only moderate lensing.

*Aleksandra Leśniewska,Jens Hjorth,Christa Gall*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过分析超过12万个红外选星系的数据，发现宇宙尘埃移除时间尺度随红移增加而缩短，从红移0.05时的18亿年降至红移大于3时的不足5亿年。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 理解星系中尘埃的演化对研究气体动力学、冷却、恒星形成及化学演化至关重要。现有研究主要集中在低红移（z < 0.4）的星系，而尘埃移除的主要驱动力被认为是年老恒星群体和活动星系核（AGN）。

Data: 使用了由赫歇尔望远镜观测到的公开红外选星系目录数据，包括尘埃质量、恒星质量和恒星年龄等信息。

Method: 通过推断尘埃质量、恒星质量和恒星年龄，计算了超过12万个星系样本中的尘埃移除时间尺度。

Result: 研究发现，随着红移增加，尘埃移除时间尺度从红移0.05时的18亿年缩短至红移大于3时的不足5亿年，表明高红移星系中的尘埃移除效率更高，可能由AGN活动、超新星冲击和恒星形成驱动。

Abstract: Understanding the evolution of dust in galaxies is crucial because it affects
the dynamics and cooling of gas, star formation, and chemical evolution. Recent
work on dust removal in galaxies indicates timescales of gigayears, with old
stellar populations and AGNs as the primary drivers of this process. However,
most statistically significant studies are focused on low redshifts $z < 0.4$.
Here, we determine the dust removal timescale in galaxies over a wide range of
redshifts, up to $z \sim 5$. We use publicly available catalogue data of
infrared-selected galaxies, observed by \textit{Herschel}. Using the inferred
dust masses, stellar masses, and stellar ages, we calculate the dust removal
timescale in a sample of more than 120,000 galaxies. We find that, with
increasing redshift, the dust removal timescale decreases from 1.8 Gyr at
redshift $z \sim 0.05$ to less than 500\,Myr at $z > 3$. Galaxies at higher
redshifts undergo more efficient dust removal than galaxies at lower redshift,
likely driven by AGN activity, supernova shocks, and astration. These findings
indicate that dust removal evolves over cosmic time, reflecting the changing
mechanisms regulating dust content of galaxies as the Universe evolves.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 暗物质（DM）仍然是基础物理学中最引人注目的未解决问题之一，这促使人们寻找新的探测方法。

Data: 本文使用了四量子比特和九量子比特系统的数据。

Method: 研究采用了基于网络的量子传感器架构，每个节点是一个超导量子比特，通过受控Z门在对称拓扑结构中连接，并使用变分量子计量框架优化状态准备和测量。此外，还采用了贝叶斯推断从测量结果中提取暗物质引起的相位偏移。

Result: 结果表明，优化的网络配置显著优于传统的基于GHZ的协议，同时在噪声中等规模量子硬件上保持浅电路深度，且灵敏度在局部退相干噪声下保持稳健。

Abstract: Dark matter (DM) remains one of the most compelling unresolved problems in
fundamental physics, motivating the search for new detection approaches. We
propose a network-based quantum sensor architecture to enhance sensitivity to
ultralight DM fields. Each node in the network is a superconducting qubit,
interconnected via controlled-Z gates in symmetric topologies such as line,
ring, star, and fully connected graphs. We investigate four- and nine-qubit
systems, optimizing both state preparation and measurement using a variational
quantum metrology framework. This approach minimizes the quantum and classical
Cramer-Rao bounds to identify optimal configurations. Bayesian inference is
employed to extract the DM-induced phase shift from measurement outcomes. Our
results show that optimized network configurations significantly outperform
conventional GHZ-based protocols while maintaining shallow circuit depths
compatible with noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware. Sensitivity remains
robust under local dephasing noise. These findings highlight the importance of
network structure in quantum sensing and point toward scalable strategies for
quantum-enhanced DM detection.

Result: 研究发现重子密度分布在0.3到50 Mpc/h尺度上得到良好约束，重子分布的外斜率比某些模拟预测的更浅，且忽略重子会导致GGL模型低估晕质量约20%。

Abstract: We present the first joint analysis of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ)
effect with galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) for CMASS galaxies in the Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We show these complementary probes can
disentangle baryons from dark matter in the outskirts of galactic halos by
alleviating model degeneracies that are present when fitting to kSZ or GGL
measurements alone. In our joint kSZ+GGL analysis we show that the baryon
density profile is well constrained on scales from 0.3 to 50 Mpc/$h$. With our
well constrained profile of the baryon density, we provide direct comparisons
to simulations. For our model we find an outer slope of the baryon distribution
that is shallower than predicted by some hydrodynamical simulations, consistent
with enhanced baryonic feedback. We also show that not including baryons in a
model for GGL can bias halo mass estimates low by $\sim 20\%$ compared to a
model that includes baryons and is jointly fit to kSZ+GGL measurements. Our
modelling code galaxy-galaxy lensing and kSZ (\texttt{glasz}) is publicly

**TL;DR**: 利用ASTRID宇宙流体动力学模拟，研究JWST观测到的“小红点”星系（LRDs）的模拟对应物，发现这些星系具有高恒星质量和大质量黑洞，处于由黑洞反馈引起的短暂“迷你熄灭”演化阶段。

Background: JWST观测到的“小红点”星系（LRDs）是一类具有特殊颜色和大小的星系，其研究有助于理解星系演化中的黑洞反馈机制。

Data: 使用ASTRID宇宙流体动力学模拟中的星系数据（红移范围5到8）。

Method: 通过模拟ASTRID中的星系并筛选符合LRDs颜色和大小标准的样本，分析其恒星质量、黑洞质量、尘埃衰减等特性。

Result: 发现17个符合LRDs标准的星系，这些星系具有高恒星质量（log(M*/Msun)≥9.7）、大质量黑洞（log(MBH/Msun)≥6.8）、密集的恒星分布和显著的尘埃衰减，处于由黑洞反馈引起的“迷你熄灭”阶段。

Abstract: We present simulated counterparts of the ``Little Red Dot'' (LRD) galaxies
observed with JWST, using the large cosmological hydrodynamic simulation,
ASTRID. We create mock observations of the galaxies ($5 \leq z \leq 8$) in
ASTRID, and find seventeen which fit the color and size criteria of LRDs. These
LRDs are galaxies with high stellar masses ($\rm log(M_*/M_{\odot}) \geq 9.7$),
and massive black holes ($\rm log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot}) \geq 6.8$). The host
galaxies are dense, with stellar half mass radii ($\rm 325\,pc \leq r_{{\rm
half},*} \leq 620\,pc$), and dust attenuation in the F444W band above 1.25.
Their star formation has been recently quenched. They host relatively bright
AGN that are dust-obscured and contribute significantly to the rest-frame
optical red slope and have relatively low luminosity in the rest-frame
ultraviolet, where the host galaxy's stars are more dominant. These LRDs are in
an evolutionary phase of miniquenching that is the result of AGN feedback from
their massive black holes. The LRDs in ASTRID are bright with F444W magnitudes
of $23.5-25.5$. The less massive and fainter galaxies in ASTRID lack the dust
concentration necessary to produce the red slope of an LRD, though this could
be an effect of limited resolution. Most of the highest Eddington black holes
are not LRDs due to their host galaxies having typical dust levels and
relatively high star formation rates accompanying their highly accreting black
holes, resulting in their spectra being too flat.

**TL;DR**: 通过比较BPASS和SeBa模型预测的双白矮星（DWDs）数量与实际观测数据，研究发现BPASS模型低估了短周期DWDs的数量，而SeBa模型与观测结果一致，表明LISA的观测将有助于约束恒星演化理论。

Background: 目前关于银河系中双白矮星（DWDs）的研究发现，不同恒星演化模型（如BPASS、SeBa和BSE）对LISA可探测的DWDs数量预测存在显著差异，尤其是BPASS模型预测的数量比其他模型少20至40倍，这与质量转移和共包层事件（CEEs）的处理方式有关。

Data: 研究使用了BPASS和SeBa星系模型预测的DWDs数据，并与已知的DWDs目录及Zwicky瞬变设施（ZTF）观测的DWDs样本进行了比较。

Method: 通过比较BPASS和SeBa模型预测的DWDs数量与实际观测数据（ZTF观测样本），并考虑了ZTF的观测限制和偏差。

Result: 研究发现BPASS模型低估了短周期DWDs的数量至少一个数量级，而SeBa模型在距离超过500 pc的DWDs中与观测结果一致，表明LISA的观测将有助于改进恒星演化理论模型。

Abstract: Context: Studies of the Galactic population of double white dwarfs (DWDs)
that would be detectable in gravitational waves by LISA have found differences
in the number of predicted detectable DWDs of more than an order of magnitude,
depending on the binary stellar evolution model used. Particularly, the binary
population synthesis code BPASS predicts 20 to 40 times fewer detectable DWDs
than the codes SeBa or BSE, which relates to differing treatments of mass
transfer and common-envelope events (CEEs).
  Aims: We aimed to investigate which of these models are closer to reality by
comparing their predictions to the DWDs known from electromagnetic
observations.
  Methods: We compared the DWDs predicted by a BPASS galaxy model and a SeBa
galaxy model to a DWD catalogue and the sample of DWDs observed by the Zwicky
Transient Facility (ZTF), taking into account the observational limits and
biases of the ZTF survey.
  Results: We found that BPASS underpredicts the number of short-period DWDs by
at least an order of magnitude compared to the observations, while the SeBa
galaxy model is consistent with the observations for DWDs more distant than 500
pc. These results highlight how LISA's observations of DWDs will provide
invaluable information on aspects of stellar evolution such as mass transfer
and CEEs, which will allow theoretical models to be better constrained.
