We analyze the dynamics in triaxial\nmerger remnants and subsequent interactions with geometrically thick nuclear\ndiscs. We confirm that gravitational torques in triaxial potentials efficiently\nextract angular momentum, resulting in binary formation with high initial\neccentricities. We then analyze the binary-disc interaction using a 3D\nanalytical framework incorporating the Airy formalism and potential softening.\nWe present a self-consistent derivation demonstrating that the 3D suppression\nof high-order torques leads to distinct scalings with disc thickness ($h$):\nmigration rates $\\tau_a^{-1} \\propto h^{-3}$ and eccentricity damping rates\n$\\tau_e^{-1} \\propto h^{-5}$. This establishes a timescale hierarchy,\n$\\tau_e/\\tau_a \\propto h^2$. For typical parameters ($h\\approx 0.2$),\neccentricity damping is significantly faster than orbital decay ($\\tau_e\n\\approx 0.04 \\, \\tau_a$). We further develop a wavelet-based formalism to\nquantify the impact of disc inhomogeneities arising from accretion feedback and\nturbulence. We derive the stochastic torque variance in the wavelet domain and\nemploy a Fokker-Planck analysis to determine the equilibrium eccentricity\ndistribution. While stochastic fluctuations counteract deterministic damping,\nthe strong damping imposed by the thick disc geometry ensures the equilibrium\neccentricity remains small unless the fluctuations are highly non-linear.\nHence, even if born highly eccentric, SMBHBs are rapidly circularized. This\ncircularization trap forces binaries to approach the gravitational\nwave-dominated regime on nearly circular orbits, prolonging the total merger\ntimescale. This introduces a substantial cosmological delay governed by stellar\nrelaxation, which impacts detection rates and the modeling of SMBH assembly in\ncosmological frameworks."}

A large, 28 m diameter telescope is used in monoscopic mode to access\nthe lowest energies ($E \\gtrsim 30$ GeV), while the four smaller, 12 m diameter\ntelescopes are used in stereoscopic mode to study energies between 150 GeV and\n100 TeV.

In this work, we propose for the first\ntime an analysis based on event types capable of exploiting both telescope\ntypes, trigger strategies, and the whole energy range of the experiment. Due to\nthe large differences between monoscopic and stereoscopic reconstructions, the\ntypes are defined based on Hillas parameters of individual events, resulting in\nthree types (Type M, Type B, and Type A), each dominating over a different\nenergy range. The performances of the new analysis configurations are compared\nto the standard configurations in the H.E.S.S. Analysis Package (HAP), Mono and\nStereo. The proposed analysis provides optimal sensitivity over the whole\nenergy range, in contrast to Mono and Stereo, which focus on smaller energy\nranges. On top of that, improvements in sensitivity of 25-45% are found for\nmost of the energy range. The analysis is validated using real data from the\nCrab Nebula, showing the application to data of an IACT analysis capable of\ncombining significantly different telescope types with significantly different\nenergy ranges.

Studying protostellar objects in their earliest stages, particularly\nduring the Class 0 phase, provides key insight into the beginnings of planet\nformation and dust evolution. Disentangling the various components, however, is\nparticularly challenging. High spatial and spectral resolution observations of\nmolecular line emission with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array\n(ALMA) are therefore crucial for probing their complex environments. Methods.\nIn this work, we present high-resolution ($\\sim$30 au) ALMA observations at 1.3\nmillimeters of the Class 0 protostellar system IRAS4A2. Results. We detected\nlarge, well-traced outflows in HCN (3-2), H$_{2}$CO$(2_{1~2}-1_{1~1})$, and\nHCO$^{+}$ (3-2), along with numerous complex organic molecules (COMs) tracing\ncentral, more compact regions.

Specifically, we find\nthat CH$_{3}$CDO and CH$_{3}$OCHO could be both good tracers of the disk,\npossibly tracing its rotation. Lines of OCS (22-21),\nSO$_{2}~(13_{3~11}-13_{2~12})$, HCN, H$_{2}$CO, and HCO$^{+}$, show more\nextended structures around IRAS4A2, likely tracing the envelope, disk,\naccretion shocks, the base of an outflow, and the outflow itself. Conclusions.\nMost COMs appear to trace distinct inner regions near the central protostar,\nwhile other molecules trace more extended structures, such as the envelope or\noutflows. The kinematics, emission patterns, and position-velocity diagrams\nsuggest that individual molecules trace multiple components simultaneously,\nmaking it challenging to disentangle their true origins.

While pulsar timing arrays reach nHz frequencies and\nground-based interferometers probe the audio band, the regime above the MHz\nscale remains essentially untested. We propose a hybrid detection framework in\nwhich gravitons convert to photons via the Gertsenshtein effect in strong\nmagnetic fields; the resulting electromagnetic signal is resonantly enhanced in\na cavity and read out by atomic quantum sensors. Our approach combines multiple\nchannels, including long-coherence Raman interferometry in alkali atoms,\nmicrowave Rydberg transitions, photoionization-based detection, and inner-shell\nelectronic resonances. We derive the graviton-photon conversion probability,\ncompute the induced photon flux, and estimate the shot-noise-limited spectral\nstrain noise density. Depending on configuration, the projected\nshot-noise-limited sensitivity ranges from $\\sqrt{S_{h, {\\rm min}}} \\sim\n10^{-22}{\\rm\\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ in conservative microwave implementations to\n$\\sqrt{S_{h, {\\rm min}}} \\sim 10^{-37}{\\rm\\,Hz^{-1/2}}$ in aggressive optical\nRaman schemes, potentially surpassing the cosmological bound from Big Bang\nNucleosynthesis for stochastic backgrounds, while coherent bursts remain\nunconstrained and detectable. Such reach allows to test scenarios involving\nprimordial black holes, topological defects, violent phase transitions, and\n(p)reheating, motivating advances in high-$Q$ cavities, strong-field magnets,\nand quantum-limited atomic sensors, with broad impact across quantum metrology\nand fundamental physics."}

The inflaton self-interactions are found to be of higher order in\nthe Hubble expansion rate during inflation, and hence unimportant for CMB\nobservations. In contrast, matter couplings to the Starobinsky inflaton can\nhave significant effects on the spectral index of scalar CMB perturbations,\n$n_s$, and on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$. Using a renormalization-group\nimproved analysis of the effective inflationary potential, we find that the\nPlanck measurement of $n_s$ constrains the inflaton coupling to light fermions\nin the Einstein frame: $y < 4.5 \\times 10^{-4}$, corresponding to an upper\nlimit on the reheating temperature $T_{\\rm RH} < 2 \\times 10^{11}~{\\rm GeV}$,\nwhereas the ACT DR6 measurement of $n_s$ corresponds to $3.8 \\times 10^{-4} < y\n< 5.6 \\times 10^{-4}$ and $1.7 \\times 10^{11} ~{\\rm GeV} < T_{\\rm RH} < 2.8\n\\times 10^{11}~{\\rm GeV}$, while the upper limits on $r$ provide weaker\nconstraints.

Searches for gravitational-wave lensing by the\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration have begun. One common method focuses on\nstrong gravitational-wave lensing, which produces multiple \"images\": repeated\ncopies of the same gravitational wave that differ only in amplitude, arrival\ntime, and overall \"Morse phase.\" The literature identifies two separate\napproaches to identifying such repeated gravitational-wave events based on\nfrequentist and Bayesian approaches. Several works have discussed selection\neffects and identified challenges similar to the well-known \"birthday problem\",\nnamely, the rapidly increasing likelihood of false alarms in an ever-growing\ncatalogue of event pairs. Here, we discuss these problems, unify the different\napproaches in Bayesian language, and derive the posterior odds for strong\nlensing. In particular, the Bayes factor and prior odds are sensitive to the\nnumber of gravitational-wave events in the data, but the posterior odds are\ninsensitive to it once strong lensing time delays are accounted for. We confirm\nLo et al.'s (2020) finding that selection effects enter the Bayes factor as an\noverall normalisation constant. However, this factor cancels out in the\nposterior odds and does not affect frequentist approaches to strong lensing\ndetection."}

Methods: In this work we show results from the first\ncosmological MHD simulation with an on-the-fly spectral CR model. We model CR\ninjection at shocks, account for adiabatic energy changes and advection of CR\nprotons, and obtain their $\\gamma$-ray emissivity directly from the simulated\nCR energy density and spectra. For this we use constrained initial conditions,\nwhich evolve in a field closely resembling that of the local Universe, allowing\ndirect comparison to Fermi-LAT data on massive clusters. Results: We find CR\nproton acceleration at all structure formation and accretion shocks in galaxy\nclusters and cosmic web filaments. These protons provide the basis for diffuse\n$\\gamma$-ray emission in these regimes. The absolute value of the diffuse\n$\\gamma$-ray emission in our simulation lies a few orders of magnitude below\nthe current upper limits found by Fermi-LAT.
