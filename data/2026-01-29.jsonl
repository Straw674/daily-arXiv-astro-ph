The observations were taken as part of a pilot project for the MAJORS large program at the JCMT telescope. By incorporating prior knowledge of N(H$_2$) and $T_K$, assuming a constant density, and using the RADEX radiative transfer code we found that the HCN and HCO$^+$ abundances range from $X$(HCN) = $0.4-7.0 \\times 10^{-8}$ and $X$(HCO$^+$) = $0.4-7.3 \\times 10^{-9}$. Additional modelling using the NAUTILUS chemical evolution code, that takes H$_2$ density variations into account, however, suggests the HCN and HCO$^+$ abundances may be fairly constant. Careful modelling of three different positions finds $X$(HCN) = $1.3-1.7 \\times 10^{-8}$, $X$(HCO$^+$) = $1.3-3.1 \\times 10^{-9}$. Cross-comparison of the two models also provides a crude estimate of the gas density producing the HCN and HCO$^+$ emission, with H$_2$ densities in the range $5 \\times 10^4 - 5 \\times 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, suggesting that the HCN and HCO$^+$ emission does indeed arise from dense gas. High UV intensity (e.g. $G_o >$ a few thousand) has no effect on the abundances in regions where the visual extinction is large enough to effectively shield the gas from the UV field. In regions where $A_V < 6$, however, the abundance of both species is lowered due to destructive reactions with species that are directly affected by the radiation field."}

We explore four prescription models of the evolution of R3 with UV emission based on the new measurements and results from previous surveys. Applying these models to the GLIMPSE [O III]+Hb luminosity functions, we measure and extrapolate the ionising photon production rate $\\dot{N}_{ion}$ of galaxies down to very faint limits SFR(Ha) > 5e-3 Msun/yr. Our results support the dominant contribution of star-forming galaxies to reionisation, and are consistent with the recent discovery of ultra-faint metal-poor galaxies.

Submitted to ApJ. Comments welcome", "summary": "Ultra-faint galaxies at high-$z$ are fundamental elements of the early galaxy assembly, and spectroscopic characterization of this population is essential to understand the earliest galaxy evolution. Leveraging the ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of a gravitational lensing field of Abell S1063, taken as part of the GLIMPSE survey, we present spectroscopic properties of 16 galaxies fainter than $M_{\\rm UV}=-17$ mag, including the metallicity, dust attenuation, and the ionizing photon production efficiency. The emission lines are generally quite strong, roughly half of which cannot be replicated with standard stellar populations and require an extreme ionizing source. We also identify relatively strong [OIII] emission lines from all sample galaxies, which indicates that the low-mass end of the mass-metallicity relation is extended down to $M_\\star\\sim10^6\\ M_\\odot$ at $z\\sim6$. The strong [OIII] line detection from the lowest-mass galaxy among the sample ($M_\\star\\sim10^{5.6}\\ M_\\odot$) stands in contrast to recent reports of extremely metal-poor galaxy candidates at similar mass and redshift, suggesting that there could be two distinct pathways of the earliest metal enrichment as simulations have predicted. Interestingly, we detect both dust attenuation and galactic outflow in one of the sample galaxies with $M_\\star=10^{6.6}\\ M_\\odot$ at $z=5.5$. All the dust, metal, and outflow contents in this galaxy can be consistently explained by supernovae (SNe), indicative of the key roles of SNe in the earliest galaxy assembly such as dust production, metal enrichment, stellar feedback, and baryon cycle."}

The authors concluded that two types of next-generation detectors are needed to answer these questions: high-accuracy instruments and detectors that maximize exposure at the highest energies. The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA), a proposed dual-satellite observatory, exemplifies the latter class and is designed to increase statistics of the highest-energy cosmic rays and to detect very-high-energy neutrinos following multi-messenger alerts. POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) implements a compact, balloon-borne version of the POEMMA concept, adapted for a Super-Pressure Balloon flight from Wanaka, New Zealand, with an expected campaign exceeding 20 days. PBR couples a wide field-of-view Schmidt telescope and a hybrid optical focal surface with a dedicated radio instrument to deliver simultaneous, complementary measurements of extensive air showers. The mission will validate the fluorescence detection strategy from space and raise technology readiness for a POEMMA-like space mission by observing UHECR-induced fluorescence light from suborbital altitudes, obtaining the first simultaneous optical Cherenkov and radio observations of high-altitude horizontal air showers above the cosmic-ray knee (E>3PeV), enabling energy-spectrum and composition studies at the PeV scale, and performing follow-ups of multi-messenger alerts to search for very-high-energy neutrinos via upward-going air showers. This paper summarizes the PBR payload and its expected performance."}

Studying their progenitors, proto-clusters, sheds light on the earliest stages of cluster formation. Yet, detecting proto-clusters is demanding: their member galaxies are loosely bound and the emerging hot intracluster medium (ICM) may only be in the initial stages of virialization. Recent JWST observations located several proto-cluster candidates by identifying overdensities of $z\\gtrsim5$ galaxies. However, none of these candidates was detected by X-ray observations, which offer a powerful way to unveil the hot ICM. Here, we report the combined Chandra and JWST detection of a proto-cluster, JADES-ID1, at $z\\approx5.68$, merely one billion years after the Big Bang. We measure a bolometric X-ray luminosity of $L_{\\rm bol} = (1.5^{+0.5}_{-0.6}) \\times10^{44} \\ \\rm{erg \\ s^{-1}}$ and infer a total gravitating mass of $M_{500}= (1.8^{+0.6}_{-0.7}) \\times 10^{13} \\ \\rm{M_{\\odot}}$, making this system a progenitor of today's most massive galaxy clusters. The detection of extended, shock-heated gas indicates that substantial ICM heating can occur in massive halos as early as $z\\approx5.7$. In addition, given the limited survey volume, the discovery of such a massive cluster is statistically unlikely, implying that the formation of the large-scale structure must have occurred more rapidly in some regions of the early universe than standard cosmological models predict."}

While COMs were once expected to be efficiently destroyed under UV-irradiated conditions, detections in photodissociation regions (PDRs) have challenged this view. However, the mechanisms by which UV radiation contributes to their formation are still uncertain. Here, we present moderately resolved maps of simple and complex organic molecules at the UV-illuminated edge of the Horsehead nebula, obtained by combining ALMA and IRAM 30m single-dish observations at $\\sim 15^{\\prime\\prime}$ resolution. We analyze the spatial distribution of species such as C$^{17}$O, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, CH$_3$CN, and HC$_3$N. By incorporating previous C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O single-dish data as well as PdBI maps of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH, we derive profiles of gas density, temperature, thermal pressure, and column densities of the organic species as a function of distance from the UV source. Our results show that most organic species$-$particularly H$_2$CO, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, and CH$_3$CN$-$exhibit enhanced column densities at the UV-illuminated edge compared to cloud interiors, possibly indicating efficient dust-grain surface chemistry driven by the diffusion of atomic C and radicals produced via photodissociation of CO and CH$_3$OH, as supported by recent laboratory experiments. The exceptions, HC$_3$N and CH$_3$OH, can be attributed to inefficient formation on dust grains and ineffective non-thermal desorption into the gas phase, respectively. Additionally, contributions from gas-phase hydrocarbon photochemistry$-$possibly seeded by grain-surface products$-$cannot be ruled out. Further chemical modeling is needed to confirm the efficiency of these pathways for the studied species, which could have important implications for other cold, UV-irradiated environments such as protoplanetary disks."}

Current glitch classification methods, such as Gravity Spy, rely on supervised models trained from scratch using labeled datasets. These approaches suffer from a significant ``label bottleneck,\" requiring massive, expertly annotated datasets to achieve high accuracy and often struggling to generalize to new glitch morphologies or exotic GW signals encountered in observing runs. In this work, we present a novel cross-domain framework that treats GW strain data through the lens of audio processing. We utilize the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), a model pre-trained on large-scale audio datasets, and adapt it to the GW domain. Instead of learning time-frequency features from scratch, our method exploits the strong inductive bias inherent in pre-trained audio models, transferring learned representations of natural sound to the characterization of detector noise and GW signals, including IMBHs. We validate this approach by analyzing strain data from the third (O3) and fourth (O4) observing runs of the LIGO detectors. We used t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised clustering technique, to visualize the AST-derived embeddings of signals and glitches, revealing well-separated groups that align closely with independently validated Gravity Spy glitch classes. Our results indicate that the inductive bias from audio pre-training allows superior feature extraction compared to traditional supervised techniques, offering a robust, data-efficient pathway for discovering new, anomalous transients, and classifying complex noise artifacts in the era of next-generation detectors."}

Working in the Einstein frame, we consider a spatially flat FLRW universe filled with pressureless matter and a universally coupled dilaton. Expanding the conformal coupling function and the scalar potential around the least-coupling point, we obtain a closed and self-consistent autonomous system governing the late-time evolution of the scalar-matter sector. The resulting phase space contains a stable fixed point associated with least coupling, approached only asymptotically along cosmological trajectories. Therefore, at any finite epoch the solution typically retains a small displacement from the fixed point. In the DP regime this finite-epoch displacement sets the ambient coupling, and thus determines the magnitude of fifth-force effects and deviations from the equivalence principle in the nonrelativistic limit. By linearising the system around a finite-epoch reference state, we show that the damping of the displacement is controlled by the Jacobian eigenvalues of the DP fixed point. This yields a direct dynamical estimate of how rapidly deviations from the equivalence principle are reduced during cosmological evolution. The mechanism is global and cosmological in origin, and is conceptually distinct from local environmental screening as in chameleon or symmetron scenarios. Overall, our results illustrate how phase-space techniques provide a clear bridge between cosmological dynamics and weak-field departures from General Relativity."}

Since star formation is expected to be fed by external gas accretion, the knowledge about the circumgalactic media (CGM) of these galaxies is essential to understanding how they quench. In this work, we present the discovery of a massive and passive galaxy ($M_\\star\\simeq10^{11}\\,M_\\odot$) within the MQN01 structure at z~3.25, containing one of the largest overdensities of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) found so far at $z\\gtrsim3$.

Surprisingly, it is located at the center of a large cool gas reservoir, as traced by bright Ly$α$ and H$α$ emission. By taking advantage of deep multi-wavelength information unique to this field, including deep Chandra X-ray data, we argue that the inefficient gas accretion from the CGM onto this galaxy over the last few hundreds of Myr, as suggested by the observations, could be caused by an AGN jet of a nearby star-forming galaxy located at a projected distance of 48 kpc. In particular, we argue that the jet feedback may have maintained a high level of CGM turbulence around the passive galaxy and thus caused a reduced gas accretion over the required time-scales. In addition, the elevated ionizing field provided by the AGN overdensity, including the nearby AGN, can illuminate the passive galaxy's cool CGM and make it visible through fluorescent emission. Our study demonstrates that the star formation rates of high-redshift galaxies could be substantially reduced and maintained at a low level even within gas-rich and overdense environments in particular situations."}

Published in The Astrophysical Journal", "summary": "Understanding the variability of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) requires coordinated, multi-wavelength observations that span the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work, we focus on data from four key observatories: Chandra in the X-ray (2-8 keV), GRAVITY on the Very Large Telescope in the near-infrared (2.2 microns), Spitzer in the infrared (4.5 microns), and ALMA in the submillimeter (340 GHz). These multi-band observations are essential for probing the physics of accretion and emission near the black hole's event horizon, yet they suffer from irregular sampling, band-dependent noise, and substantial data gaps. These limitations complicate efforts to robustly identify flares and measure cross-band time lags, key diagnostics of the physical processes driving variability. To address this challenge, we introduce a diffusion-based generative model, for interpolating sparse, multivariate astrophysical time series. This represents the first application of score-based diffusion models to astronomical time series. We also present the first transformer-based model for light curve reconstruction that includes calibrated uncertainty estimates. The models are trained on simulated light curves constructed to match the statistical and observational characteristics of real Sgr A* data. These simulations capture correlated multi-band variability, realistic observation cadences, and wavelength-specific noise. We compare our models against a multi-output Gaussian Process. The diffusion model achieves superior accuracy and competitive calibration across both simulated and real datasets, demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for high-fidelity, uncertainty-aware reconstruction of multi-wavelength variability in Sgr A*."}

Using the measured power spectra, we present constraints on the thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effects, radio galaxies, and cosmic infrared background (CIB). We find that inferred SZ powers are dependent on the detailed modeling of the thermal SZ-CIB correlation, and to a lesser extent on the assumed angular dependence of the SZ spectra. We report constraints for simulation-based model templates as well as fits where the angular dependencies of the SZ and CIB power spectra are allowed to vary.

Our analysis uses the correspondence with the stellar velocity field to split the complex emission line profiles of the CO(1-0) line into components in gravitational and non-gravitational motion. We find a massive ($8\\times10^{9}\\,M_\\odot$) molecular outflow containing about 40% of the total molecular gas mass in the system. The outflow shows a bi-conical morphology centered on the brightest galaxy in the merger, oriented along its minor axis and extending to $\\sim5\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$.

The neutral atomic and ionized gas phases traced by NaI absorption and H$α$ emission show counterparts to the blueshifted cold molecular outflow but are only 15% and 3% as massive. None of the three gas phases show any signs of slowing down over the extent at which we detected the outflow, suggesting an acceleration mechanism acting on the outflowing gas at kiloparsec scales. We also detect $3.5\\times 10^7\\,M_\\odot$ of dust, traced by optical extinction in the MUSE data, in the blueshifted outflowing cold molecular gas. The ionization state of the non-outflowing gas is consistent with star formation, while the outflowing component shows shock-like ionization.

Hogg", "Andrew Sayjdari", "Lily Zhao"], "title": "A constrained linear model for continuum normalization of stellar spectra", "categories": ["astro-ph.SR", "astro-ph.IM"], "comment": "AAS accepted", "summary": "Inferring stellar parameters and chemical abundances by forward modeling stellar spectra usually requires a spectral synthesis code, or an emulator constructed from a curated training set. In these situations continuum normalization is often implemented as a pre-processing step that is independent of stellar parameters. This leads to results that are biased, or inconsistent across signal-to-noise ratios. A more justified approach is to forward model spectra with all nuisances simultaneously, but in practice this can be an expensive or non-convex optimization procedure. Here we describe a constrained linear model that can fit stellar absorption, telluric transmission, the joint continuum-instrument response. Stellar absorption and telluric transmission are each modeled by factorizing a grid of rectified theoretical spectra into two non-negative matrices with a chosen number of basis components. This model characterizes all possible spectra in many fewer parameters than comparable data-driven models. The non-negativity constraint ensures basis vectors are strictly additive, which limits rectified flux to less than or equal to unity, such that we can distinguish normalized spectra from the joint instrument-continuum response. The model requires no initial guess, and the linearity ensures that inference is convex, stable, and fast. This model allows us to reliably fit nuisances (e.g., tellurics, continuum), and is readily extensible to radial velocity and rotational broadening, without any prior knowledge about the fundamental stellar properties. We demonstrate our method by fitting ESO/HARPS high-resolution echelle spectra of BAFGKM-type stars. With repeat observations of $α$-Centauri A we present results that are best in class: consistent across time to 0.2% at S/N ~ 100, and to better than 0.5% at S/N ~ 30."}

We show that could be the case by modelling the inhomogeneities and their effects in three different ways: as clumped matter surrounded by voids, as back-reaction of small-scale structure on the overall expansion of the Universe, and, finally, as a large-scale curvature inhomogeneity. In all of these cases, the propagation of light is affected, and differs from that in a homogeneous and isotropic universe. The net result is that cosmological observables, such as angular diameter and luminosity distances, become distorted. We find, in all three models, that the inclusion of these effects pushes the distance-redshift relation towards closer agreement with recent data from both supernovae Ia from the Dark Energy Survey, and from baryon acoustic oscillations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. The amount of inhomogeneity in these models might not be enough to explain the entirety of the deviation from a cosmological constant, but is found to be of a similar order of magnitude, hinting that these data may be consistent with a universe dominated by a cosmological constant."}

We derive stellar masses and specific star formation rates using Prospector fits to UV-MIR broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 42 TDE hosts, together with a high-mass comparison sample, and combine these with SMBH mass estimates from the literature. We first verify our approach by reproducing the established result that quenched galaxies host more massive SMBHs than star-forming systems at fixed stellar mass, a result widely interpreted as evidence for SMBH growth driving the blue-to-red sequence transition. However, examining the TDE sample in isolation reveals a trend reversal at lower masses, uncovering a surprising population of low-mass ($10^{9.6} \\lesssim M_{\\rm gal} \\lesssim 10^{10.5}$ M$_\\odot$), quenched galaxies hosting SMBHs systematically less massive ($M_{\\rm BH} \\lesssim 10^{6.5}$ M$_\\odot$) than those in star-forming galaxies of comparable stellar mass. After ruling out degeneracies in our SED fits, we conclude that this reflects a physical difference in the quenching mechanism between these TDE hosts and the more massive galaxies. This is unlikely to be driven by AGN feedback, and could instead result from environmental processes, which can end star formation and hinder SMBH growth. We also show that the quenched and post-starburst population within the TDE sample is likely under-represented due to selection biases, suggesting the true fraction could be even higher than observed."}

We present the results from one such effort, the first 24,186 hours of the GREENBURST search for dispersed radio pulses with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). To date, GREENBURST has detected a total of 50 pulsars and three FRBs. One of the pulsars, PSR J0039+5407, has a period of 2.2 s and was previously unknown. Using follow-up observations with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, we found a timing solution for this pulsar which shows it to have a characteristic age of 2 Myr. Additional GBT observations show the pulsar has a very high nulling fraction ($\\sim70-80\\%$). All three of the FRBs are repeating sources that were previously known and were being monitored by the GBT as part of other projects. A major challenge for GREENBURST in the discovery of new FRBs is its single beam. This makes it hard to distinguish some of the pulses from sources of radio frequency interference. We highlight this problem with a case study of an FRB-like pulse that initially passed our interference filters. Upon closer inspection, the event appears to be part of a longer-duration narrow-band source of unknown origin. Further observations and monitoring are required to determine whether it is terrestrial or celestial."}

We test two scenarios for training: (1) on the data vectors and (2) on the full $κ$-maps.

One candidate mechanism is rotational emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which can have the necessary electric dipole moment and size distribution to account for the AME in representative interstellar environments. However, previous investigations have found that AME is better correlated with the far-infrared dust emission rather than the PAH emission. In this work we analyze the correlations between the AME and the PAH and far-infrared dust emission using the 3.3 $μ$m PAH emission feature as observed by band 3 of the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE). This analysis builds on previous work conducted in individual molecular clouds and extends it into fainter, more diffuse structures. In addition, we utilize the COSMOGLOBE DIRBE reduction for this work, building on previous studies that used the original DIRBE data set. We find that the AME is better correlated with far-infrared dust emission ($ρ\\sim$0.9) than the PAH emission ($ρ\\sim$0.7) in the central $|b|\\leq$ 10\\degree\\ region of the sky. This could indicate either that non-PAH dust grains or an alternative physical emission mechanism is primarily responsible for the AME in the Galactic Plane, or that the excitation conditions for mid-infrared emission and for AME from PAHs differ substantially."}

An alternate approach is based on catalogs of galaxies, supplemented with some scheme for filling in for unseen galaxies.

We find factor-two level differences in some regions and even greater in regions toward the Galactic center zone of avoidance (ZoA) (|l| < 30°, |b| < 20°) as filled by Biteau using \"cloning\". Within 11 Mpc the density field is well-determined by the Local Volume catalog (Karachentsev et al. 2018) which Biteau directly incorporates; at larger distances, Biteau (2021) should not be used in the ZoA where \"galaxies\" are entirely fictitious but otherwise is to be preferred over CosmicFlows emphasizing the direction and integrated mass of structures; the radial distribution of mass in Biteau (2021) is less robust due to line-of-sight peculiar velocities.

We investigate the spatial clustering properties of 225,382 quasars from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) within the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Data Release 2 footprint, split by the statistically-calculated fraction of their radio flux densities contributed by jets (relative to the contribution from star formation). We find a positive correlation between the clustering strengths of quasars and their jet fraction, where quasars with a higher jet fraction have a higher clustering amplitude measured by their two-point correlation functions. We show that this correlation is unlikely related to differences in BH masses or bolometric luminosities. Quasars dominated by powerful jet activities generally reside in dark matter haloes $10-100$ times more massive than those without strong jets, with typical halo masses of $10^{13-14}\\ h^{-1}M_\\odot$, establishing a robust link between powerful AGN jets and rich cluster environments. Our results demonstrate that halo mass is important for determining the power of radio jets, but suggest that there is no minimum dark matter halo mass or BH mass required for the triggering of jets. The observed correlation suggests that BH spin is likely to play a minor role in jet production; instead, the key driver could be the presence of a strong magnetic flux."}

In preparation for the forthcoming analysis of the Euclid spectroscopic data, we investigate three approaches to modelling RSD effects on the power spectrum multipoles of mock H$α$ emission line galaxies. We focus on two one-loop perturbation theory models -- the effective field theory (EFT) and velocity difference generator (${\\rm VDG_ \\infty}$) -- which differ in their treatment of the real-to-redshift space mapping on small scales, and a third approach, the BACCO emulator, which adopts a hybrid strategy combining perturbation theory with high-resolution N-body simulations. We assess the ability of these models to recover key cosmological parameters, including the expansion rate $h$, the cold dark matter density parameter $ω_{\\rm c}$, and the scalar amplitude $A_{\\rm s}$, across four redshift bins spanning $0.9 \\leq z \\leq 1.8$. In each bin, we find that ${\\rm VDG_ \\infty}$ and BACCO outperform the EFT model across all scales up to $k_{max} \\lesssim 0.35 h\\,Mpc^{-1} $. While BACCO saturates in constraining power at intermediate scales and higher redshift, the ${\\rm VDG_ \\infty}$ model continues to improve parameter constraints beyond $k_{max} \\gtrsim 0.30 h\\,Mpc^{-1}$. The EFT model, although robust on large scales, exhibits significant parameter biases for $k_{max} \\gtrsim 0.25 h\\,Mpc^{-1}$, limiting its applicability to Euclid-like H$α$ samples.

We use proper motions combined with backward orbit integration in a semi-analytic potential to constrain plausible interaction scenarios for Pisces and And XVI. Both dwarfs are currently M31 satellites, defined as being inside its virial radius. However, our results show that, in our fiducial mass models, 42% (And XVI) and 60% (Pisces) of dwarf orbits support that they were previously satellites of M33 (i.e., once inside its virial radius). Both dwarfs had fly-by encounters with M33 at relative velocities greater than M33's escape speed within the past 1-2 Gyr. In over 70% of orbits, Pisces and And XVI also had a close approach with each other post-M33 interaction and share an orbital plane, suggesting possible past group accretion. We explore a range of mass combinations for M31 and M33, finding that this primarily regulates the likelihood that the dwarfs were satellites of M33 in the past, while upholding conclusions of recent flybys about M33. These close interactions provide new evidence for past satellite exchange and/or group infall scenarios between M31 and M33. Such interactions also affect comparisons to observational surveys that define satellites primarily by their distance relative to host galaxies."}

Known models of inflation, like the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors are at least $2σ$ off the ACT data. In this work we aim to provide a top-to-bottom approach in single scalar field inflationary cosmology compatible with the ACT data. Specifically, inspired by the fact that the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors, all being plateau potentials, result to the same attractor relation between the spectral index of scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which is of the form $n_s(r)=1-αr^{1/2}$, in this work we seek for attractors of the form $n_s(r)=f(r)$ that may lead to ACT-compatible inflation. Specifically, we fix the function $f(r)$ to have a specific desirable form and then solve the differential equation $n_s(r)=f(r)$ to find the potential which results to the relation $n_s(r)=f(r)$. We discovered analytically three classes of potentials which are variants of the general form $n_s(r)=γ\\pm βr \\pm r^{1/2}$ and all these models are found to be compatible with the ACT data."}

In this work we investigate how to realize a smooth transition between a slow-roll and a power-law inflationary regime in the context of single scalar field inflation. As we show it is possible to realize such a smooth transition by generalizing the kinetic energy of single scalar field in the form $\\dotφ^2=β(φ)V(φ)$, where $β(φ)$ is some appropriate function of the scalar field. Using two distinct approaches we show that it is possible to realize a smooth transition from a slow-roll to a power-law inflationary regime, and the two approaches produce identical results regarding the slow-roll regime. Also we show that the slow-roll regime is quite short, about $N\\sim 30$ $e$-foldings, with the flatness and horizon problems being solved with the synergistic effect of the two inflationary patches.

However, masses of distant galaxies are highly uncertain, as they assume a distribution of stellar birth masses (the initial mass function [IMF]) similar to that in the Milky Way (MW). Specifically, the contribution from low-mass stars, which make up the bulk of stellar mass, is not directly observed, but inferred based on an extrapolation of the MW IMF. Here, we provide the first robust measurements of the IMF beyond the local Universe. Using ultra-deep spectra of nine massive, quiescent galaxies at $z\\sim0.7$ from the ambitious JWST-IMFERNO program, extended to bluer wavelengths with deep spectra from LEGA-C [8], we find that these distant galaxies have excess low-mass stars. In other words, they have more bottom-heavy IMFs than the MW. For the oldest two galaxies, which are direct descendants of JWST's \"impossibly early\" galaxies, the bottom-heavy IMFs increase their stellar masses by a factor of $3-4$. These galaxies thus amplify the tension with galaxy formation models."}

Studying their progenitors, proto-clusters, sheds light on the earliest stages of cluster formation. Yet, detecting proto-clusters is demanding: their member galaxies are loosely bound and the emerging hot intracluster medium (ICM) may only be in the initial stages of virialization. Recent JWST observations located several proto-cluster candidates by identifying overdensities of $z\\gtrsim5$ galaxies. However, none of these candidates was detected by X-ray observations, which offer a powerful way to unveil the hot ICM. Here, we report the combined Chandra and JWST detection of a proto-cluster, JADES-ID1, at $z\\approx5.68$, merely one billion years after the Big Bang. We measure a bolometric X-ray luminosity of $L_{\\rm bol} = (1.5^{+0.5}_{-0.6}) \\times10^{44} \\ \\rm{erg \\ s^{-1}}$ and infer a total gravitating mass of $M_{500}= (1.8^{+0.6}_{-0.7}) \\times 10^{13} \\ \\rm{M_{\\odot}}$, making this system a progenitor of today's most massive galaxy clusters. The detection of extended, shock-heated gas indicates that substantial ICM heating can occur in massive halos as early as $z\\approx5.7$. In addition, given the limited survey volume, the discovery of such a massive cluster is statistically unlikely, implying that the formation of the large-scale structure must have occurred more rapidly in some regions of the early universe than standard cosmological models predict."}

While the positive $Λ$ sector [1] yields a continuous spectrum and a single bounce, we show here that the negative $Λ$ sector leads to a discrete spectrum of energy eigenvalues, effectively quantizing the cosmological constant. Within this dual description, the operator-ordering ambiguity parameter appears as the azimuthal quantum number of the hydrogen atom. A skewed Bohr correspondence emerges for the bound states, matching classical evolution at large volumes but deviating near the bounce. By constructing wave packets from these bound states, we demonstrate that the classical Big Bang and Big Crunch singularities are resolved, and the universe oscillates between quantum bounces and classical turnaround points. The expectation values of the observables indicate a cyclic universe -- with vanishing Hubble parameter at turnarounds -- undergoing quantum bounces. This exactly solvable model offers a tractable setting to explore quantum gravitational effects in cosmology. We analyze the properties of this cyclic universe, contrasting its bound-state dynamics with the scattering states of the de Sitter case."}

Several mechanisms have been proposed to overcome these planet formation barriers, such as dust porosity or the streaming instability (SI), which is today regarded as the most promising mechanism to form planetesimals. Aims: Here, we examine whether the conditions for the SI to lead to strong clumping, the first step in planetesimal formation, are realised in protoplanetary discs containing porous grains. Methods: We used results from previous simulations of the evolution of porous grains subjected to growth, fragmentation, compaction and bouncing in protoplanetary discs. In the ensuing disc structures, we determined the regions where the dust-to-gas ratio exceeds the critical value for strong clumping found in simulations of the SI including external turbulence. Results: We find that the conditions for strong clumping are met within the first hundred thousand years in large regions of protoplanetary discs containing porous grains, provided that the CO snow line is taken into account. If the CO snow line is neglected, the conditions are met only very close to the inner disc edge early on, or over large areas well after 200,000 yr."}

Various experiments are designed to search for the axion, however no confirmative signal has been observed. On the other hand, there are also hypothetical heavy particles in axion models, such as the heavy scalar $s$, which is the CP-even component of the complex scalar that carries $U(1)_{PQ}$ charge, and the vector-like heavy quark (VLQ) in the Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov~(KSVZ) axion model. Studying signals induced by them are helpful for axion searches. In this paper, we calculate the graviton bremsstrahlung energy spectrum arising from the decay of the heavy scalar or VLQ in the KSVZ model. The result shows that these heavy particles can emit ultrahigh-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), with the peak frequency depending on the model's parameter inputs. In addition, the graviton spectrum is distinguished from the thermal GW background at high frequencies if there is an early matter-dominated era induced by these heavy particles. Future measurements of ultrahigh-frequency GWs may provide indirect evidence for the KSVZ axion."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Observations of binary black hole (BBH) mergers provide a unique window into the lives of massive stars across cosmic time. Connecting redshift-dependent merger properties to massive star progenitors requires accurate models of cosmic star formation and chemical enrichment histories. Analytical fits for the metallicity-specific cosmic star formation rate density S(Z, z) are commonly used as proxies for the complex underlying star formation history, yet they remain unconstrained. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, we evaluate the accuracy of these analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions and assess how simulation resolution and volume affect the inferred S(Z, z). By coupling the simulated and analytical S(Z, z) to the population synthesis code COMPAS, we investigate the resulting BBH merger rates and mass distributions. We find that analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions can overestimate BBH merger rates at high redshift ($z \\gtrsim 6$) by up to a factor of $10$-$10^4$, depending on cosmological simulation resolution, and can introduce spurious features in the BBH mass distribution. For example, they can produce an artificial feature near $8\\,M_\\odot$ in the primary mass distribution at $z \\lesssim 2$, which is absent when using the full simulation-based S(Z, z), while simultaneously suppressing high-mass features. These discrepancies arise because simple analytical models fail to capture a high-metallicity bump and a more flattened low-metallicity tail in the simulated S(Z, z) metallicity distribution. Our results highlight the importance of accurate star formation histories for modeling BBH populations, demonstrate the limitation of widely used analytical S(Z, z) fits, and underscore the need for careful integration of cosmological simulations, analytical fits, and population synthesis when interpreting gravitational-wave observations."}

We aim to carry out a large-scale investigation of surface helium (He) abundances in Galactic O-type stars, based on the results from the analysis of high-quality spectroscopic data from the IACOB project. We perform a homogeneous spectroscopic analysis of 318 Galactic O-type stars with the IACOB-BROAD and FASTWIND/IACOB-GBAT tools, deriving rotational velocities, atmospheric parameters, and He abundances. We also account for the influence of binarity, runaway status, and parameter degeneracies (e.g., microturbulence, wind properties, diagnostic lines, and companion contamination) on the abundance determinations. We present homogeneously determined surface He abundances (YHe=N(He)/N(H)) for the so far largest, statistically significant sample of Galactic O-type stars. About 78% of the stars show He abundances consistent with the previously proposed cosmic abundance standard of YHe=0.098$\\pm$0.002. The remaining 22% display clear He enrichment (YHe>0.13). We also provide observational evidence indicating that most of these He-enriched stars are likely the products of binary interaction. Our study highlights how large spectroscopic surveys are gradually opening robust observational avenues to identify the products of massive binary interaction. It also emphasizes the need for caution when interpreting the spectroscopic properties of apparently single O-type stars. A significant fraction may in fact be the outcome of binary evolution rather than isolated stellar birth."}
