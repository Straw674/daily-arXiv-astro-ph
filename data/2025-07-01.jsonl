We\nfind 14 dormant galaxies with stellar masses ranging from $10^{7.6}-10^{10.5}$,\nrevealing an intermediate-mass population of such galaxies. By construction,\nthe 14 sources reported are located about 1 dex below the star-forming main\nsequence. Their star formation histories suggest that they halted star\nformation between 10 and 25 Myr before the time of observation which, according\nto models, is comparable with the timescales of internally regulated bursts\ndriving a \"breathing\" mode of star formation. Our results show that ~1% of the\ngalaxies in the DJA are in a dormant phase of their star formation histories\nand span a wide stellar mass range. These galaxies can be empirically selected\nusing only their spectral features in NIRSpec prism data."}

A major source of uncertainty in\nprevious $Y_\\mathrm{P}$ determinations is the lack of extremely metal-poor\ngalaxies (EMPGs; $0.01-0.1Z_\\odot$), which have metallicities a few to ten\ntimes lower than the metal-poor galaxies (MPGs; $0.1-0.4Z_\\odot$) predominantly\nused in earlier studies, requiring substantial extrapolation to zero\nmetallicity. Here, we perform Subaru near-infrared spectroscopy of 29 galaxies,\nincluding 14 EMPGs. By incorporating existing optical spectra, we derive He/H\nfor each galaxy using photoionization modeling of helium and hydrogen emission\nlines, including the He I 10830 {\\AA} line to break the density-temperature\ndegeneracy.

It is assumed that the planet\nmoves along a parabolic trajectory that intersects the disk plane near the\nstar. Gas-dynamic simulation is performed using the finite volume method on a\nlong time scale. On its basis, images of the disk observed from the pole and\nedge-on are constructed in the infrared and submillimeter ranges. A wide range\nof planet orbit parameters is considered. The approach of the planet was\nconsidered both prograde and retrograde with the respect to the disk rotation.\nCalculations have shown that in the images of the disk seen pole-on, two spiral\narms can be observed in case of the prograde fall, and one with retrograde\ncase. In the case of observations of a disk whose plane is inclined at a small\nangle to the line of sight, distortions of the disk plane can be noticeable. In\naddition, a gas tail is extended from the disk in the direction of the planet's\nmotion, which can also be identified in observations."}

Building upon\nprevious successes in applying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to leptonic\nemission scenarios, we present an efficient CNN-based approach for modeling\nblazar emission under proton synchrotron and hybrid lepto-hadronic frameworks.\nOur CNN is trained on extensive numerical simulations generated by SOPRANO,\nwhich span a comprehensive parameter space accounting for the injection and all\nsignificant cooling processes of electrons and protons. The trained CNN\ncaptures complex interactions involving both primary and secondary particles,\neffectively reproducing electromagnetic and neutrino emissions. This allows for\nrapid and thorough exploration of the parameter space characteristic of\nhadronic and hybrid emission scenarios. The effectiveness of the trained CNN is\ndemonstrated through fitting the spectral energy distributions of two prominent\nblazars, TXS 0506+059 and PKS 0735+178, both associated with IceCube neutrino\ndetections. The modeling is conducted under assumptions of constant neutrino\nflux across distinct energy ranges, as well as by adopting a fitting that\nincorporates the expected neutrino event count through a Poisson likelihood\nmethod. The trained CNN is integrated into the Markarian Multiwavelength Data\nCenter (MMDC; https://www.mmdc.am), offering a robust tool for the\nastrophysical community to explore blazar jet physics within a hadronic\nframework."}

A fundamental ingredient in shaping our\nunderstanding of AGN is their variability across the entire electromagnetic\nspectrum. Variability studies have the potential to help us understand the\ngeometry of the emitting regions (in various energy bands), their causal\nrelations, and the physics of the accretion processes. This review focuses on\nthe observational properties of AGN variability in the optical/UV/X-ray bands\n(where most of the AGN luminosity is emitted) and their dependence on the AGN\nphysical parameters (i.e. mass, luminosity, accretion rate). We also discuss\npossible interpretations in the context of accreting compact systems, and we\nreview the use of variability as a tool to discover AGN and trace their\nproperties across cosmic time, using both ground and space facilities. Finally,\nwe discuss the opportunities and challenges provided by current and\nnext-generation optical/X-ray surveys, to use variability as an effective tool\nto probe the growth of super massive black holes in the Universe."}

Differing sensitivities to planet bulk properties between the\nmicrolensing and transit methods require relations like a planet mass-radius\nrelation (MRR) to mediate. We propose using instead a planet-host ratio\nrelation (PHRR) to couple directly microlensing and transit observables. Unlike\nthe MRR, a PHRR uses parameters that are always measured and so can leverage\nthe full Roman exoplanet sample. Using 908 confirmed exoplanets from the NASA\nExoplanet Archive, we show that transit depth, $\\delta$, and planet-host mass\nratio, $q$, obey a PHRR that is continuous over all planet scales. The PHRR is\nimproved by including orbital period, $P$, and host effective temperature,\n$T_{\\star}$. We compare several candidate PHRRs of the form $\\delta (q,T_\\star,\nP)$, with the Bayesian Information Criterion favouring power-law dependence on\n$T_\\star$ and $P$, and broken power-law dependence on $q$. The break in $q$\nitself depends on $T_\\star$, as do the power-law slopes in $q$ either side of\nthe break. The favoured PHRR achieves a fairly uniform $50\\%$ relative\nprecision in $\\delta$ for all $q$. Approximately $5\\%$ of the sample has a\ntransit depth that is strongly under-predicted by the PHRR; around half of\nthese are associated with large stars ($R_\\star > 2.5 \\, R_{\\odot}$)\npotentially subject to Malmquist bias."}

This complexity\nincreases when comparing different age-dating methods, as they rely on distinct\nindicators and are often applicable to non-overlapping regions of the\ncolor-magnitude diagram. Moreover, many empirical calibration methods rely on\npre-determined ages, often from open clusters or asteroseismology, which only\ncover a limited parameter space. Fortunately, the age-velocity-dispersion\nrelation (AVR), in which the velocity dispersion increases with age, is a\nuniversal feature among stars of all evolutionary stages. In this paper, we 1)\nexplore the parameter space in which [C/N] and gyrochronology are applicable,\nextending beyond the domains probed by asteroseismology and open clusters, and\n2) assess whether the traditionally assumed [C/N] and gyrochronology relations\nyield ages on a consistent physical scale, after calibrating both using the\nsame AVR. We find gyrochronology can be applied to all partially convective\nstars after they have converged onto the slow rotating sequence and before they\nexperience weakened magnetic braking; [C/N] can be used to infer ages for all\ngiants with metallicity > -0.8 dex and [C/N] < -0.05 dex, and can be used as an\nage-indicator down to [Fe/H] of -1 dex if only selecting the low-$\\alpha$ disk.\nLastly, ages obtained from [C/N] and gyrochronology agree within uncertainty\nafter accounting for systematic offsets."}
