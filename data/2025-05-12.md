**TL;DR**: 通过THESAN-ZOOM模拟研究高红移下星系尺度与云尺度的恒星形成效率关系，发现星系尺度SFE与暗晕质量和红移相关，而云尺度SFE在大多数环境下保持稳定，但在特定条件下可能出现高SFE相。

Background: 恒星形成涉及多尺度物理过程的复杂相互作用，现有研究对高红移下星系尺度与云尺度恒星形成效率的关系尚不明确。

Data: 使用THESAN-ZOOM宇宙学放大模拟套件中的数据。

Method: 通过THESAN-ZOOM模拟分析星系尺度和云尺度的恒星形成效率，并识别巨分子云（GMCs）的性质。

Result: 星系尺度SFE与暗晕质量和红移相关，云尺度SFE在大多数环境下稳定，但在特定条件下可能出现高SFE相。

Abstract: Star formation in galaxies is inherently complex, involving the interplay of
physical processes over a hierarchy of spatial scales. In this work, we
investigate the connection between global (galaxy-scale) and local
(cloud-scale) star formation efficiencies (SFEs) at high redshifts ($z\gtrsim
3$), using the state-of-the-art cosmological zoom-in simulation suite
THESAN-ZOOM. We find that the galaxy-scale average SFE, $\langle \epsilon^{\rm
gal}_{\rm ff} \rangle$, scales with $M_{\rm halo}^{1/3}\,(1+z)^{1/2} \sim
V_{\rm vir}$, consistent with expectations from feedback-regulated models. On
cloud scales, we identify giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in a broad sample of
high-redshift starbursts spanning a wide range of halo masses and redshifts.
Star formation in these systems is predominantly hosted by filamentary GMCs
embedded in a dense and highly turbulent interstellar medium (ISM). GMCs
exhibit remarkably universal properties, including mass function, size,
turbulence, and surface density, regardless of the environment in which they
are identified. The global gas depletion time (and the Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation) is determined by the GMC mass fraction in the ISM, while the
cloud-scale SFE shows little variation. In particular, we find a nearly
constant gas surface density of $\Sigma_{\rm GMC} \approx 70\,{\rm
M}_{\odot}\,{\rm pc}^{-2}$ across different host galaxies. Nevertheless, we
identify two regimes where phases with high SFE can arise. First, stars may
form efficiently in the shock fronts generated by feedback from a preceding
starburst. Second, the increasing background dark matter surface density with
redshift may contribute to the gravitational potential of clouds at $z \gtrsim
8$ and confine them in high-SFE phases over extended periods.

Abstract: The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revolutionised our
understanding of the high-redshift Universe, detecting bright, massive galaxies
up to $z\gtrsim 10$, and identifying peculiar sources called "Little Red Dots"
(LRDs). The origin of both classes of objects remains uncertain but is likely
linked to the formation and early growth of the first massive black holes
(MBHs), which may be more easily explained by invoking phases of
super-Eddington accretion. In this study, we use a state-of-the-art zoom-in
cosmological simulation of a quasar host to investigate whether these objects,
during their assembly, can resemble any of the peculiar sources observed with
JWST. We find that the impact of MBH feedback on star formation is typically
moderate, with outflows preferentially escaping perpendicular to the galactic
disc. However, for approximately ten percent of the galaxy's lifetime, the
system enters a distinct quenched phase, after a rapid MBH growth driven by
super-Eddington accretion. This phase culminates in a powerful feedback event,
during which the MBH jet and disc-driven winds interact directly with the
galactic disc, carving out a central cavity. We also find that, during the
history of the quasar host progenitor, the spectral properties of the system
can resemble both LRDs and quenched galaxies, depending on the specific
evolutionary stage considered. These findings suggest that both conditions may
represent transient phases in the life cycle of high-redshift galaxies.

**TL;DR**: 本研究利用半自动搜索方法对NGC3109周围的矮星系进行了迄今为止最深入的搜索，发现其卫星系统比冷暗物质模型的平均预测更亮。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: NGC3109是一个质量类似于小麦哲伦云（SMC）的棒旋星系，本研究旨在通过半自动搜索方法探索其周围的矮星系，以填补对SMC质量宿主星系卫星系统的研究空白。

Data: 研究使用了暗能量相机（DECam）的数据，覆盖了NGC3109周围约70千秒差距的区域。

Method: 采用了半自动化的搜索方法，包括分辨星和新设计的半分辨搜索。

Result: 成功发现了已知卫星Antlia和Antlia B，并确认了一个背景矮星系候选体；研究结果表明NGC3109的亮卫星数量多于冷暗物质模型的平均预测，但仍符合宿主间的分布范围。

Abstract: We report the results of the deepest search to date for dwarf galaxies around
NGC3109, a barred spiral galaxy with a mass similar to that of the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC), using a semi-automated search method. Using the Dark
Energy Camera (DECam), we survey a region covering a projected distance of
$\sim$70 kpc of NGC 3109 ($D$ = 1.3 Mpc, $R_\mathrm{vir}\sim$ 90 kpc,
$M\sim10^8M_\ast$) as part of the MADCASH and DELVE-DEEP programs. Through our
resolved and newly designed semi-resolved searches, we successfully recover the
known satellites Antlia and Antlia B. We identified a promising candidate,
which was later confirmed to be a background dwarf through deep follow-up
observations. Our detection limits are well defined, with the sample $\sim
80\%$ complete down to $M_V\sim-$8.0 , and includes detections of dwarf
galaxies as faint as $M_V\sim-$6.0. This is the first comprehensive study of a
satellite system through resolved star around an SMC mass host. Our results
show that NGC 3109 has more bright ($M_V\sim-$9.0) satellites than the mean
predictions from cold dark matter (CDM) models, but well within the
host-to-host scatter. A larger sample of LMC/SMC-mass hosts is needed to test
whether or not the observations are consistent with current model expectations.

**TL;DR**: Orbital Torus Imaging (OTI) 是一种利用恒星调查数据推断银河系引力势的动态方法，通过模拟验证其在动态演化系统中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: OTI 是一种基于恒星天体物理量（如元素丰度）随动态量（如轨道作用量或能量）变化的梯度来估计银河系质量分布的方法，假设系统为轴对称且稳态。然而，其对非平衡效应的敏感性尚不明确。

Data: 使用了 Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) 宇宙流体动力学模拟数据，特别是 m12i 模拟数据，用于比较已知的垂直加速度剖面和总表面质量密度与 OTI 推断结果。

Method: OTI 方法通过分析恒星天体物理量的梯度来推断引力势，并在模拟的银河盘内嵌入太阳类似体积进行验证。

Result: 尽管系统处于动态演化中，OTI 在 94%/75% 的体积中恢复了已知的垂直加速度剖面，误差在 3 sigma/1 sigma 范围内。然而，对于具有大尺度高度（>1.5 kpc）和低总密度的体积，准确性下降。

Abstract: Orbital Torus Imaging (OTI) is a dynamical inference method for determining
the Milky Way's gravitational potential using stellar survey data. OTI uses
gradients in stellar astrophysical quantities, such as element abundances, as
functions of dynamical quantities, like orbital actions or energy, to estimate
the Galactic mass distribution, assuming axisymmetry and steady-state of the
system. While preliminary applications have shown promising outcomes, its
sensitivity to disequilibrium effects is unknown. Here, we apply OTI to a
benchmark Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) cosmological hydrodynamic
simulation, m12i, which enables a comparative analysis between known FIRE-2
vertical acceleration profiles and total surface mass densities to the
analogous OTI-inferred results. We quantify OTI's accuracy within solar-analog
volumes embedded in the simulated galactic disk. Despite a dynamically-evolving
system, we find that OTI recovers the known vertical acceleration profiles
within 3 sigma/1 sigma errors for 94%/75% of the volumes considered. We discuss
the method's sensitivity to the local, instantaneous structure of the disk,
reporting a loss in accuracy for volumes that have large (>1.5 kpc) scale
heights and low total density at z=1.1 kpc. We present realistic OTI error bars
from both MCMC sampling and bootstrapping the FIRE-2 simulated data, which
provides a touchstone for interpreting results obtained from current and
forthcoming surveys such as SDSS-V, Gaia, WEAVE, and 4MOST.

**TL;DR**: 通过分析NGC 628星系中分子云和恒星形成区域的分布，研究发现其与引力不稳定性的理论预测尺度（约700 pc）接近，解决了观测与理论之间的不一致性。

Background: 目前观测到的星系螺旋臂中恒星形成区域的规则间距（约500 pc）与引力不稳定性的波长估计（>1 kpc）存在矛盾。

Data: 使用了NGC 628星系的高质量观测数据，包括分子云和恒星形成区域的分布数据。

Method: 研究了多组分有限厚度盘中径向和方位角扰动的引力不稳定性机制，并绘制了不稳定性波长分布图。

Result: 研究发现引力不稳定区域与恒星形成区域高度一致，分子云分布规则性约为500-600 pc，方位角扰动的最不稳定波长中值约为700 pc，接近观测尺度。

Abstract: Context. There is a contradiction between the characteristic spacings in
observed regular chains of star-forming regions in the spiral arms of galaxies,
~500 pc, and the estimates of the wavelength of gravitational instability in
them, >1 kpc. Aims. Calculating the scales of regularity in the grand-design
galaxy NGC 628 in terms of gravitational instability, using modern high-quality
observational data and comparison of them with scales of spatial regularity of
the star-forming regions and molecular clouds in the spiral arms of the galaxy.
Methods. We investigate two mechanisms of gravitational instability against
radial and azimuthal perturbations in a multi-component disk with a finite
thickness. We obtain a map of the instability wavelength distribution and
compare its median value with the typical scale of observed regularity.
Results. The maps of instability parameters Q and S, which are related to
radial and azimuthal perturbations respectively, show a good alignment between
gravitationally unstable regions and areas of recent star formation. By
analyzing the distribution of giant molecular clouds along the spiral arms of
NGC 628, we found a similar regularity of about 500-600 pc that was previously
observed for starforming regions. Additionally, the distribution of the
wavelength most unstable to azimuthal perturbations yielded a median value of
about 700 pc, which is close to the observed scale regularity. This last
finding resolved the discrepancy between the theoretically predicted and
observed scales of star-forming regions' regularity.

**TL;DR**: 通过AGORA项目中八种最先进的宇宙流体动力学模拟代码，研究了恒星反馈差异对银河系类似前身星系在红移1到5之间不同形态的影响，发现恒星反馈的细节对高红移盘组装过程至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域关注恒星反馈对星系形态的影响，但不同模拟代码在反馈实现上的差异导致对盘组装过程的理解存在不确定性。本研究旨在通过多代码比较，揭示恒星反馈细节对高红移星系形态形成的关键作用。

Data: 使用了AGORA项目中八种最先进的宇宙流体动力学模拟代码生成的数据。

Method: 通过比较八种不同的宇宙流体动力学模拟代码，分析恒星反馈差异对星系形态的影响。

Result: 研究发现，恒星反馈的差异导致模拟星系分为两组：一组表现出强烈的湿压缩特征（形成旋转主导的内核），另一组压缩特征较弱。两组星系在大小、恒星年龄梯度及盘质量比上存在显著差异，且尘埃消光使它们在模拟观测中的形态更接近观测数据。

Abstract: We investigate how differences in the stellar feedback produce disks with
different morphologies in Milky Way-like progenitors over 1 $\leq z \leq 5$,
using eight state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamics simulation codes in the
\textit{AGORA} project. In three of the participating codes, a distinct,
rotation-dominated inner core emerges with a formation timescale of $\lesssim
300$ Myr, largely driven by a major merger event, while two other codes exhibit
similar signs of wet compaction -- gaseous shrinkage into a compact starburst
phase -- at earlier epochs. The remaining three codes show only weak evidence
of wet compaction. Consequently, we divide the simulated galaxies into two
groups: those with strong compaction signatures and those with weaker ones.
Galaxies in these two groups differ in size, stellar age gradients, and
disk-to-total mass ratios. Specifically, codes with strong wet compaction build
their outer disks in an inside-out fashion, leading to negative age gradients,
whereas codes with weaker compaction feature flat or positive age gradients
caused primarily by outward stellar migration. Although the stellar half-mass
radii of these two groups diverge at $z \sim 3$, the inclusion of dust
extinction brings their sizes and shapes in mock observations closer to each
other and to observed galaxies. We attribute the observed morphological
differences primarily to variations in the stellar feedback implementations --
such as delayed cooling timescales, and feedback strengths -- that regulate
both the onset and duration of compaction. Overall, our results suggest that
disk assembly at high redshifts is highly sensitive to the details of the
stellar feedback prescriptions in simulations.

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过多种天体物理代码模拟同一银河系质量晕，分析了卫星星系中的恒星形成熄灭现象，发现熄灭分数与观测结果一致，并揭示了主导熄灭机制为窒息和冲压剥离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 卫星星系在与宿主晕相互作用时会经历多种物理过程，通常导致恒星形成熄灭。在局部群中，卫星熄灭效率很高，影响几乎所有卫星，但最巨大的卫星除外。然而，银河系质量晕中卫星熄灭的主导物理机制仍存在争议。

Data: 研究使用了来自多代码AGORA CosmoRun套件的高分辨率宇宙学放大模拟数据，模拟了一个银河系质量晕。

Method: 研究分析了同一银河系质量晕的模拟数据，这些数据由多种广泛使用的天体物理代码生成，每种代码采用不同的流体动力学方法和超新星反馈方案。

Result: 研究发现，所有模型的熄灭分数与最新SAGA调查结果一致，且熄灭时间尺度与ELVES调查、局部群观测和先前模拟的趋势一致。主导熄灭机制为窒息（阻止冷气体吸积）和冲压剥离（气体移除的主要机制），但不同代码中剥离机制的效率存在差异，显示出对超新星反馈实现和流体动力学方法的敏感性。

Abstract: Context: Satellite galaxies experience multiple physical processes when
interacting with their host halos, often leading to the quenching of star
formation. In the Local Group (LG), satellite quenching has been shown to be
highly efficient, affecting nearly all satellites except the most massive ones.
While recent surveys are studying Milky Way (MW) analogs to assess how
representative our LG is, the dominant physical mechanisms behind satellite
quenching in MW-mass halos remain under debate. Aims: We analyze satellite
quenching within the same MW-mass halo, simulated using various widely-used
astrophysical codes, each using different hydrodynamic methods and implementing
different supernovae feedback recipes. The goal is to determine whether
quenched fractions, quenching timescales and the dominant quenching mechanisms
are consistent across codes or if they show sensitivity to the specific
hydrodynamic method and supernovae (SNe) feedback physics employed. Methods: We
use a subset of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a MW-mass
halo from the multiple-code AGORA CosmoRun suite. Results: We find that the
quenched fraction is consistent with the latest SAGA survey results within its
1$\sigma$ host-to-host scatter across all the models. Regarding quenching
timescales, all the models reproduce the trend observed in the ELVES survey, LG
observations, and previous simulations: the less massive the satellite, the
shorter its quenching timescale. All our models converge on the dominant
quenching mechanisms: strangulation halts cold gas accretion and ram pressure
stripping is the predominant mechanism for gas removal, particularly effective
in satellites with $M_* < 10^8\, M_\odot$. Nevertheless, the efficiency of the
stripping mechanisms differs among the codes, showing a strong sensitivity to
the different SNe feedback implementations and/or hydrodynamic methods
employed.

**TL;DR**: 本研究利用深度学习方法和SDSS数据发现了新的极环星系（PRGs），并通过CIGALE软件分析了其中一颗星系的多波段性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 极环星系（PRGs）的研究需要更有效的方法来发现和分类，现有目录中的样本数量有限，且缺乏多波段性质的分析。

Data: 使用了SDSS星系目录（z < 0.1）和现有PRGs目录中的高质量图像作为训练样本。

Method: 采用了深度学习（包括迁移学习和合成图像生成）、图像增强、图像分割和集成学习技术。

Result: 发现了三个新的PRGs，并通过视觉检查在2200个环星系中发现了四个PRGs；使用CIGALE软件分析了其中一个星系的恒星形成率和总质量。

Abstract: The aim of our research is to create a catalog of strong and good candidates
for PRGs using existing catalogs of PRGs, develop an image-based approach with
machine learning methods for the search and discovery of PRGs in a big sky
survey, and explore the capability of the CIGALE software for determining their
multiwavelength properties. For the first time, we applied a deep learning
method to the search for PRGs. We visually inspected galaxies from existing
catalogs of PRGs to create a training sample based on high-quality SDSS images.
Since the resulting training sample was extremely small (87 strong and good
PRGs), we applied augmentation, image segmentation, and ensemble learning
techniques. However, most effective method was transfer learning with its
ability to enlarge the training sample by synthetic images generated by GALFIT.
To examine deep learning approach for finding new PRGs we used the SDSS catalog
of galaxies at z < 0.1. The method with synthetic images showed that even with
overtraining we were able to find galaxies with a ring pattern. Our deep
learning approach has resulted in the discovery of three PRGs (SDSS
J140644.42+471602.0; SDSS J133650.48+492745.3; SDSS J095717.30+364953.5). Also,
we visually inspected the Catalog of the SDSS Ring galaxies at z < 0.1 and
discovered four PRGs among ~2,200 ring galaxies (SDSS J095851.32+320422.9; SDSS
J104211.05+234448.2; SDSS J162212.63+272032.2; SDSS J104600.10+090627.2). One
of the discovered galaxies with transfer learning, SDSS J140644.42+471602.0,
was studied with CIGALE software to determine its spectral energy distribution
in IR-UV bands. The current SFR is 71 M_sun per year, although the lack of FUV
data limits this estimate. The total stellar mass is 8.34x10^{10} M_sun. The
predominance of an old stellar population (two-thirds of the total mass)
suggests that this PRG is undergoing interaction process.

**TL;DR**: 研究利用JWST观测数据分析了四个高红移（z=5.10--5.78）被动演化星系的性质，发现它们可能通过尘埃遮蔽的恒星形成区或活动星系核（AGN）经历早期熄灭过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 近期JWST观测发现了一些在宇宙大爆炸后约1.5 Gyr（z>4）就已被动演化的星系，这些星系表现出强烈的发射线（如Hα和[OIII]）和巴尔默跳变，为研究早期星系熄灭机制提供了独特视角。

Data: 研究使用了JWST/NIRCam和NIRSpec的观测数据，分析了Abell 2744天区中的四个高红移星系。

Method: 通过光谱能量分布（SED）拟合分析，研究了这些星系的熄灭历史和尘埃分布特征，并对其中一个星系的中波段覆盖数据进行了Hβ+[OIII]发射线成像。

Result: 研究发现这些星系在观测时间前约100 Myr就已基本熄灭，且尘埃衰减在星云成分中比连续谱更强，表明可能存在尘埃遮蔽的恒星形成区或AGN。此外，一个星系的发射线区域比恒星成分更紧凑，支持了“由外向内”熄灭的机制。

Abstract: Recent James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have discovered
galaxies that are already passively evolving at $z>4$, $\sim1.5$\,Gyr after the
Big Bang. Remarkably, some of these galaxies exhibit strong emission lines such
as \ha\ and \oiii\ while showing a strong continuum break at $\sim3650$\,\AA\
i.e., Balmer break, giving us a unique insight into the physical mechanisms
responsible for early galaxy quenching. In this study, we investigate the
nature of four such galaxies at $z=5.10$--$5.78$ identified in the Abell~2744
field, using JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec data. Our spectral energy distribution
(SED) fitting analysis reveals that these galaxies have been mostly quiescent
since $\sim100$\,Myr prior to the observed time. We find a higher dust
attenuation in the nebular component than in the continuum in all cases. This
suggests the presence of dusty star-forming regions or obscured AGN, which
could be a {\it residual} signature of past quenching. For one of the galaxies
with sufficient medium-band coverage, we derive the \hb+\oiii\ emission line
map, finding that the line-emitting region is located in the center and is more
compact ($R_e=0.7$\,kpc) than the stellar component ($R_e=0.9$\,kpc). For this
specific galaxy, we discuss a scenario where quenching proceeds in the manner
of ``outside-in", a stark contrast to the inside-out quenching commonly seen in
massive galaxies at later cosmic times.

Background: 目前对双超大质量黑洞系统的研究存在不足，而光学QPOs的检测为发现此类系统提供了新方法。

Data: 使用了CSS-V和ZTFg/r波段的光变曲线数据。

Method: 应用了多种分析方法检测QPOs，并结合宽发射线特征探讨了可能的机制，如喷流和盘进动模型。

Result: 在ZTF g/r波段光变曲线中发现了两个显著周期（1103±260天和243±29天），支持SDSS J1004+1510中存在BSMBH系统，并可能暗示了一个亚秒差距尺度的三重黑洞系统。

Abstract: This manuscript investigates the possible existence of a binary supermassive
black holes (BSMBH) system in the blue quasar SDSS J100438.8+151056 (=SDSS
J1004+1510) at z=0.219 based on the detection of robust optical QPOs. We
determine QPOs using multiple analysis methods applied to the CSS-V, ZTFg/r
band light curves, and additionally, combined with the characteristics of broad
emission lines and explores potential mechanisms for the QPOs, including jet
and disk precession models. Two distinct periodicities, $1103\pm260$days and
$243\pm29$days, are identified in the ZTF g/r-band light curves with confidence
level exceeding $5\sigma$, through four different techniques. Meanwhile, the
$1103\pm260$days periodicity is also clearly detected in the CSS V-band light
curve. The optical periodicities suggest a BSMBH system candidate in SDSS
J1004+1510, with an estimated total virial BH mass of $(1.13\pm0.14)\times10^8
M_{\odot}$ and a space separation of $0.0053\pm0.0016$pc for the periodicity of
$1103\pm260$days. The second periodicity of $243\pm29$days could be attributed
to harmonic oscillations, considering $(1103\pm260)/(243\pm29)\sim4.54\pm0.47$
with large scatters. However, if the periodicity of $243\pm29$days was from an
independent QPO, a triple BH system candidate on sub-pc scale could be probably
expected, with space separations of $0.00036\pm0.00004$pc between a close BSMBH
system and of $0.0053\pm0.0016$pc between the BSMBH system and the third BH,
after considering similar BH mass of the third BH as the total mass of the
central BSMBH. These findings strongly demonstrate that combined light curves
from the different sky survey projects can lead to more reliable QPOs
candidates to be detected, and also indicate higher quality light curves could
be helpful to find probably potential QPOs with multiple periodicities leading
to rare detections of candidates for sub-pc triple BH systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 主流观点认为极端射电源仅存在于椭圆星系中，但本研究发现的螺旋星系宿主DDRG挑战了这一观点。

Data: 使用了DESI Legacy Imaging Survey（DR10）的高分辨率光学成像数据，以及RACS和GLEAM的射电观测数据。

Method: 通过表面亮度剖面拟合确认宿主星系（LEDA 896325）的螺旋臂特征和盘成分，并利用射电数据的多频分析获得谱指数分布和谱年龄估计。

Result: 研究证实了该盘星系中存在反复的喷流活动，并确认其为已知最大的螺旋宿主射电星系，其双双结构使其成为仅有的三个螺旋宿主DDRG中最大的一个，证明盘星系确实可以发射极大规模的射电喷流。

Abstract: We present the serendipitous discovery of a double-double radio galaxy (DDRG)
with a projected linear size exceeding 2 Mpc, hosted by a spiral galaxy. This
unique combination of a giant radio structure and a spiral host challenges the
prevailing view that such extreme radio sources reside only in elliptical
galaxies. Using high-resolution optical imaging from the DESI Legacy Imaging
Survey (DR10), we confirm a spiral-arm feature and a disk-component in the
surface brightness profile fitting for the host galaxy (LEDA 896325) having a
black hole of mass 2.4 $\times$ 10$^8$ $\rm M_{\odot}$. Radio observations from
RACS and GLEAM reveal two distinct pairs of radio lobes. Using the
multi-frequency analysis of radio data, we obtained the spectral index
distribution and estimate the spectral ages of the outer and inner radio lobes
to be approximately 120 and 35 Myr, respectively. Our results confirm recurrent
jet activity in this disk galaxy and establish it as the largest known radio
galaxy in a spiral host, and its double-double structure makes it the largest
of only three such spiral-host DDRGs, demonstrating that disk galaxies can
indeed launch extremely large-scale radio jets.

**TL;DR**: 通过轨道动力学模型研究发现，Segue 1矮球状星系中心可能存在一个质量为4±1.5×10^5太阳质量的黑洞，且其动力学特征更接近各向同性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Segue 1矮球状星系被认为具有极高的暗物质与恒星质量比，但其动力学模型尚未完全明确。

Data: 研究使用了Segue 1的恒星轨道动力学数据，包括中心旋转速度的测量结果（9.0±2.4 km/s）。

Method: 采用轨道动力学模型，对Segue 1进行建模，包括暗晕和中心黑洞的假设。

Result: 最佳拟合模型显示Segue 1中心存在一个质量为4±1.5×10^5太阳质量的黑洞，且其动力学结构接近各向同性；排除黑洞的模型拟合效果较差且需要极小的暗晕尺度半径（约100秒差距）。

Abstract: The dwarf spheroidal galaxy, Segue 1, is thought to have one of the largest
ratios of dark matter to stellar mass. Using orbit-based dynamical models, we
model Segue 1, including a dark halo and a central black hole. The best-fit
model requires a black hole mass of $4 \pm 1.5 \times 10^5\ M_\odot$. The value
of the black hole mass is the same with or without a dark halo. The
mass-to-light ratio of the stars is poorly constrained by the dynamical
modeling, reflecting that Segue 1 is dominated by mass other than stars.
Dynamical models that exclude a black hole provide a worse fit and require a
dark halo with very small scale radii of around 100 parsecs. Additionally, the
zero black hole models require a stellar orbital distribution that is highly
radially biased. The model with a black hole provides an orbital structure that
is close to isotropic, more similar to other well-studied systems. We argue
that the two-parameter models of stars and black hole provide a better
description of Segue 1 than the three-parameter models of stars and two dark
halo components. Additional support for a central black hole comes from a
significant increase in the central rotation. Using individual velocities, we
measure a rotation amplitude of $9.0 \pm 2.4\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. Segue 1 is
likely being tidally stripped at large radii, and we might be witnessing the
remnant nucleus of a more massive system. Alternatively, given the high black
hole mass relative to the stellar mass, Segue 1 is analogous to Little Red Dots
seen in the early Universe.

*Niana N. Mohammed,Jessie C. Runnoe,Michael Eracleous,Tamara Bogdanović,Daniel Stern,Joseph Simon,Maria Charisi,T. Joseph W. Lazio,Kaitlyn Szekerczes,Steinn Sigurdsson,Collin Dabbieri*

**TL;DR**: 通过22年的光谱观测，发现类星体J0950+5128的宽Hβ发射线呈现单调径向速度变化，支持超大质量双星系统的存在，并拟合出轨道周期为33年、偏心率为0.65的候选系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 类星体的宽Hβ发射线通常用于研究超大质量黑洞的行为，但现有研究对双星系统的直接证据较少，J0950+5128的观测为这一领域提供了重要线索。

Data: 22年的类星体J0950+5128光谱观测数据，包括宽Hβ发射线的径向速度变化和线型变化。

Method: 使用多组分参数模型拟合光谱，通过交叉相关法测量Hβ速度位移，并结合径向速度“抖动”模拟类星体变异性，用开普勒轨道模型拟合径向速度曲线。

Result: 拟合结果显示轨道周期为33年、偏心率为0.65，半长轴下限为10的负2次方秒差距，黑洞质量下限为10的7次方太阳质量，表明J0950+5128是一个强有力的超大质量双星候选体。

Abstract: Spectroscopic observations of the quasar J0950+5128 spanning 22 years show
that its broad H$\beta$ emission line displays monotonic radial velocity
variations consistent with those expected from a supermassive binary. At the
same time, the profile of the broad H$\beta$ line is changing, necessitating
careful measurements. We present robust measurements of the broad H$\beta$
velocity shifts. We fit the spectra with a multi-component parametric model to
isolate the broad H$\beta$ by removing the stellar and non-stellar continua,
the Fe ii line blends, and various narrow and broad emission lines in its
vicinity. We measure the H$\beta$ velocity shifts via cross-correlation, both
before and after decomposing the spectra, and we demonstrate that they can be
reliably measured in spite of variations in the line profiles. We incorporate
radial velocity "jitter" into the radial velocity curve to emulate typical
quasar variability, and fit the curve with a Keplerian orbit model. The fit
yields a period of 33 years and an eccentricity of 0.65, with lower limits on
the semi-major axis and black hole mass of $10^{-2}$ pc and $10^7\ M_\odot$,
respectively. Thus, this quasar is a compelling supermassive binary candidate.
Continued monitoring is essential to further evaluate its credentials.

**TL;DR**: 通过宇宙流体动力学模拟研究星系群和星系团中熵平台的出现及其与反馈机制的关系，发现AGN反馈主导了熵的积累，并与XMM-Newton观测结果一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系间介质的热力学演化受引力坍缩、辐射冷却和星系形成相关的重子反馈的复杂相互作用驱动。

Data: 使用质量分别为8.83乘以10的12次方太阳质量和2.92乘以10的14次方太阳质量的星系群和星系团的宇宙流体动力学放大模拟数据。

Method: 采用SWIFT-EAGLE模型，分辨率级别为三个，初始气体粒子质量为2.29乘以10的5次方太阳质量，暗物质粒子质量为1.23乘以10的6次方太阳质量。

Result: 研究发现当晕质量达到约10的12次方太阳质量时，其熵分布在维里半径处趋于平坦，表明AGN反馈开始主导超新星驱动的调节；AGN反馈有效地从星系群和星系团的前身中移除低熵气体，并将其重新分布到星系间介质中。

Abstract: The thermodynamic evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM) is driven by a
complex interplay between gravitational collapse, radiative cooling, and
baryonic feedback associated with galaxy formation. Using cosmological
hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of a group of mass $8.83 \times 10^{12}$
M$_\odot$ and a cluster of mass $2.92 \times 10^{14}$ M$_\odot$ at $z=0$, we
investigate the emergence of entropy plateaus at characteristic halo masses and
their connection to feedback mechanisms. We use the SWIFT-EAGLE model with
three resolution levels, down to an initial particle gas mass of $2.29 \times
10^5$ M$_\odot$ and dark matter particle mass of $1.23 \times 10^6$ M$_\odot$.
Our analysis reveals that when halos reach $\sim 10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$, their
entropy profiles flatten at the virial radius, marking a transition where AGN
feedback begins to dominate over supernova-driven regulation. By tracking the
Lagrangian history of gas particles, we demonstrate that this entropy buildup
is driven primarily by AGN feedback, which efficiently removes low-entropy gas
from progenitors of groups and clusters, redistributing it throughout the IGM
before the gas can fall into the core region. Recent XMM-Newton observations of
X-GAP local groups reveal large entropy excesses and flat cores, in line with
our predicted plateaus and in contrast to the steeper, power-law-like profiles
of previous observations. While these predicted plateaus may be observationally
confirmed in unbiased samples, reproducing the full diversity of entropy
profiles, from flat cores to cool-core power laws, remains an outstanding
challenge for next-generation feedback models. We suggest that current AGN
feedback models may be overly efficient in expelling low-entropy gas from the
potential cool-core $10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$ progenitors, disrupting the balance
between heating and cooling required to sustain long-lived cool cores.

Abstract: Radio continuum galaxy surveys can provide a relatively fast map of the
projected distribution of structure in the Universe, at the cost of lacking
information about the radial distribution. We can use these surveys to learn
about the growth of structure and the fundamental physics of the Universe, but
doing so requires extra information to be provided in the modelling of the
redshift distribution, $dN/dz$. In this work, we show how the cross-correlation
of the two dimensional radio continuum map with another galaxy map (in this
case a photometric optical extragalactic survey), with a known redshift
distribution, can be used to determine the redshift distribution through
statistical inference. We use data from the Evolutionary Map of the Universe
(EMU) Pilot Survey 1 and cross-correlate it with optical data from the Dark
Energy Survey to fit the parameters of our $dN/dz$ model. We show that the
recovered distribution fits the data much better than current simulated $dN/dz$
models available in the literature, and peaks at a much higher redshift. These
results will have significance for future cosmological analyses with
large-scale radio continuum surveys such as the full EMU, or with the SKAO.

*Alexander J. Dittmann,Adam M. Dempsey,Hui Li*

**TL;DR**: 该研究探讨了活动星系核（AGN）吸积盘中双星系统的早期演化，特别是偏心和质量不等双星在周围气体影响下的轨道变化，揭示了顺行和逆行双星的不同演化路径及其对引力波探测的意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 活动星系核（AGN）的吸积盘中可能存在恒星和致密天体，这些致密天体形成双星后可能合并并产生引力波（如LIGO和VIRGO探测到的信号）。目前对AGN盘中双星早期演化的研究尚不充分，尤其是偏心和质量不等双星的行为。

Data: 研究未明确提及具体数据来源，但基于理论模型分析了AGN吸积盘中双星系统的演化。

Method: 研究采用了理论分析方法，重点探讨了双星在AGN盘中的轨道演化，特别是偏心和质量不等双星的行为，包括顺行和逆行双星的轨道变化、质量比的影响以及吸积过程的作用。

Result: 研究发现，顺行双星轨道会缓慢收缩且偏心被抑制，而逆行双星轨道收缩更快且可能保持高偏心；质量比显著影响双星的演化，顺行双星倾向于质量均等化，而逆行双星则趋向极端质量比；高质比逆行双星可能在合并前保持可探测的偏心，未来引力波观测将有助于研究这些系统。

Abstract: The accretion disks that power active galactic nuclei (AGN) are thought to
house populations of stars and compact objects; after forming binaries these
compact objects may merge, begetting gravitational waves such as those detected
by LIGO and VIRGO. We present a comprehensive study of the early evolution of
binaries within AGN disks as their orbits are influenced by the surrounding
gas, focusing on eccentric and unequal-mass binaries. Nearly-equal-mass
binaries behave similarly to their equal-mass counterparts: prograde binaries
inspiral, albeit somewhat slowly, and have their eccentricities damped;
retrograde binaries inspiral $\sim2-3$ times faster than their prograde
counterparts, and those with near-equal masses are driven quickly towards
near-unity eccentricities. However, the primaries in retrograde binaries with
mass ratios of $m_2/m_1\lesssim0.4$ experience significantly weaker headwinds
and retain substantial accretion disks that help damp binary eccentricities,
slowing binary inspirals. Additionally, we find that while accretion drives
prograde binaries towards equal masses thanks to the exchange of material
between the primary and secondary accretion disks, retrograde binaries are
driven slowly towards more extreme mass ratios. Prograde binaries, and
generally those with low mass ratios, likely accrete for multiple $e$-folding
timescales before merger. On the other hand, high-mass-ratio retrograde
binaries may merge before accreting substantially, potentially approaching
merger with detectable eccentricity. Future ground-based gravitational wave
observatories, with their broader frequency coverage, should be particularly
useful for studying these populations.

*Enrique Miguel García Zamora,Santiago Torres Gil,Alberto Rebassa Mansergas,Aina Ferrer i Burjachs*

**TL;DR**: 利用随机森林算法对Gaia数据中的78,920颗白矮星进行光谱分类，实现了高精度分类，并构建了一个高质量的分类样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Gaia第三次数据发布提供了超过18亿个天体的天体测量数据和2.2亿个天体的低分辨率光谱，但如此庞大的数据难以通过人工检查处理。

Data: 使用了Gaia提供的78,920颗白矮星的光谱数据，并参考了蒙特利尔白矮星数据库中已标记的样本作为训练数据。

Method: 采用随机森林算法对Gaia光谱系数进行分类，并与已发表的其他目录和更高分辨率的GTC光谱进行比较。

Result: 分类结果显示，500 pc范围内的白矮星光谱分类全局准确率为0.91，DA与非DA分类的F1得分为0.88，非DA亚型分类的准确率为0.76，F1得分为0.62。

Abstract: The third Gaia Data Release has provided the astronomical community with
astrometric data of more than 1.8 billion sources, and low resolution spectra
for 220 million. Such a large amount of data is difficult to handle by means of
visual inspection. In this work, we present a spectral analysis of the Gaia
white dwarf population up to 500 pc from the Sun based on artificial
intelligence algorithms to classify the sample into their main spectral types
and subtypes. In order to classify the sample, which consists of 78 920 white
dwarfs with available Gaia spectra, we have applied a Random Forest algorithm
to the Gaia spectral coefficients. We used the Montreal White Dwarf Database of
already labeled objects as our training sample. The classified sample is
compared with other already published catalogs and with our own higher
resolution Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) spectra, enabling the construction of
a golden sample of well-classified objects. The Random Forest spectral
classification of the 500-pc white dwarf population achieves an excellent
global accuracy of 0.91 and an F1-score of 0.88 for the DA versus non-DA
classification. In addition, we obtain a very high accuracy of 0.76 and a
global F1-score of 0.62 for the non-DA subtype classification. In particular,
our classification shows an excellent recall for DAs, DBs and DCs and a very
good precision for DQs, DZs and DOs. The use of machine learning techniques,
particularly the Random Forest algorithm, has enabled us to spectrally classify
78,920 white dwarfs with reasonable accuracy. Having an estimate of the
spectral type for the vast majority of white dwarfs up to 500 pc provides the
possibility of making better estimates of cooling ages, star formation rates,
and stellar evolution processes, among other fundamental aspects for the study
of the white dwarf population.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 主序后双星合并是大质量恒星演化的常见途径，但合并对恒星长期结构和演化的影响尚存争议，且一维建模方法不统一。

Data: 使用了11 M太阳质量和6.6 M太阳质量的双星系统，轨道周期为11天，合并时主星正在穿越赫氏间隙。

Method: 通过快速吸积或熵排序将次星物质注入主星内部，构建合并产物，并将其演化至碳点燃阶段，比较内部结构。

Result: 所有合并产物均经历延长的蓝超巨星阶段，氦核心质量较低且碳质量分数低于单星和剥离星；熵排序模型的中心密度、温度和成分演化与快速吸积模型显著不同。

Abstract: Post-main-sequence binary mergers are a common evolutionary pathway for
massive stars, but the effects of merging on the long-term structure and
evolution of the resulting star are a matter of active debate. Furthermore, the
way in which merger products are modeled in 1D is not uniform. We present the
evolution of an 11 M$_\odot$ and 6.6 M$_\odot$ binary on an 11 day orbit, that
merges while the primary is crossing the Hertzsprung gap. We construct the
merger product either by rapidly accreting the secondary onto the surface of
the primary or by injecting material from the secondary deeper into the primary
via entropy sorting. We then evolve them to carbon ignition, comparing their
interior structures at this stage. We find that all merger products experience
an extended blue supergiant phase and have undermassive helium cores and low
carbon mass fractions compared to single and stripped stars. However, the
evolution of central density, temperature, and composition in the
entropy-sorted model is distinct from those of the rapid-accretion models.
