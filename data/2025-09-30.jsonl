The black\nholes are revealed through broad H$\\alpha$ emission (FWHM = 430-2920 km/s)\nwithout a forbidden-line counterpart in the bright [O III] doublet. Channel\nmaps of the asymmetric central H$\\alpha$ profile isolate two spatially distinct\nbroad line regions (BLRs), separated by $190\\pm40$ pc, while a third BLR is\nfound in the galaxy outskirts with a projected separation of 1.7 kpc. Using\nsingle-epoch virial relations, we estimate black hole masses of\n$\\log(M_\\bullet/M_\\odot)=7.9\\pm0.4$ (primary central), $5.8\\pm0.5$ (secondary\ncentral) and $6.3\\pm0.5$ (third off-nuclear). We argue that the two central\nblack holes will likely rapidly merge, with a simple dynamical friction time\nestimate of the order of 700 Myr. Assuming that also the off-nuclear black hole\nis in the process of sinking towards the centre, it will likely lead to a\nsecond merger, and we investigate the detection probability of such mergers\nwith LISA. Alternatively, the third black hole may be the result of previous\nthree-body interaction or a gravitational recoil, where our observations would\nprovide evidence that such black holes may retain their accretion discs and\nBLRs even in the aftermath of such extreme dynamical interactions. The\ndiscovery of a black hole triplet at high redshift, together with other recent\nresults on distant black hole pairs, indicates that multiple massive black hole\nsystems were common in the early Universe. Our results highlight the importance\nof IFU observations for the detection of massive black hole multiplets in\ndistant galaxies, the progenitors of massive black hole mergers that may be\ndetected with next-generation gravitational wave observatories."}

The damping timescale is of\nparticular interest because it is related to fundamental properties of the\ncentral black hole, such as its mass and accretion rate. However, the\nsystematic underestimation of damping timescales caused by limited\nobservational baselines makes it difficult to exhaustively utilize all\navailable data. Many previous efforts have relied on strict selection criteria\nto avoid biased measurements, and such criteria inevitably constrain the range\nof AGN physical parameter space and therefore hinder robust inference of the\nunderlying dependencies of damping timescale on AGN properties. In contrast, we\nintroduce a novel forward modeling approach, Baseline-Aware Dependence fitting\nfor DAmping Timescales (BADDAT), which explicitly accounts for these biases and\nleverages the information contained in underestimated timescale measurements.\nRather than attempting to correct individual timescale measurements, BADDAT\nrobustly constrains the population-level dependence of damping timescale on AGN\nphysical properties.

This stratification cannot be readily explained by radial migration or\ntidal dissolution, but most likely reflects the hierarchical assembly of NGC\n3115's stellar halo, with later-accreted satellites deposited across broader\ngalactocentric distances.

In this article, we develop Fast Imaging Trigger\n(FITrig), a GPU-accelerated, statistics-based method for ULP pulsar detection\nand localisation. FITrig includes two complementary approaches -- an image\ndomain and an image-frequency domain strategy. FITrig offers advantages by\nincreasing sensitivity to faint pulsars, suppressing false positives (from\nnoise, processing artefacts, or steady sources), and improving search\nefficiency in large-scale wide-field images. Compared to the state-of-the-art\nsource finder SOFIA 2, FITrig increases the detection speed by 4.3 times for\nlarge images (50K x 50K pixels) and reduces false positives by up to 858.8\ntimes (at 6$\\sigma$ significance) for the image domain branch, while the\nimage-frequency domain branch suppresses false positives even further. FITrig\nmaintains the capability to detect pulsars that are 20 times fainter than\nsurrounding steady features, even under critical Nyquist sampling conditions.\nIn this article, the performance of FITrig is demonstrated using both\nreal-world data (MeerKAT observations of PSR J0901-4046) and simulated datasets\nbased on MeerKAT and SKA AA2 telescope configurations.

The motivation behind\nthis method is two-fold: Firstly, it provides individual temperature detector\nmaps from a multi-detector set, which may be useful for component separation\npurposes, in particular for line emission reconstruction. Secondly, it\nsimultaneously outputs coadded polarization maps with minimal\ntemperature-to-polarization leakage sensitivity. Algorithmically speaking, the\nN+2 mapmaker is closely related to the `spurious mapmaking' algorithm pioneered\nby the WMAP team, but rather than solving for a spurious S map together with\nthe three normal Stokes IQU parameters, we solve for N temperature maps and two\nStokes (Q and U) parameters per pixel. The result is a statistically coherent\nset of physically meaningful per-detector temperature maps, each with slightly\ndifferent bandpasses as defined by each detector, combined with coadded\npolarization maps. We test this approach on Planck Low Frequency Instrument\n(LFI) 30 GHz data, and find that the Planck scanning strategy is too poorly\ncross-linked to allow for a clean separation between temperature and\npolarization. However, noting that pairs of detectors within a single horn are\nstrongly anti-correlated, we anticipate that solving for horn maps, as opposed\nto individual detector maps, may provide an optimal compromise between noise\nand temperature-to-polarization leakage minimization.

The motivation behind\nthis method is two-fold: Firstly, it provides individual temperature detector\nmaps from a multi-detector set, which may be useful for component separation\npurposes, in particular for line emission reconstruction. Secondly, it\nsimultaneously outputs coadded polarization maps with minimal\ntemperature-to-polarization leakage sensitivity. Algorithmically speaking, the\nN+2 mapmaker is closely related to the `spurious mapmaking' algorithm pioneered\nby the WMAP team, but rather than solving for a spurious S map together with\nthe three normal Stokes IQU parameters, we solve for N temperature maps and two\nStokes (Q and U) parameters per pixel. The result is a statistically coherent\nset of physically meaningful per-detector temperature maps, each with slightly\ndifferent bandpasses as defined by each detector, combined with coadded\npolarization maps. We test this approach on Planck Low Frequency Instrument\n(LFI) 30 GHz data, and find that the Planck scanning strategy is too poorly\ncross-linked to allow for a clean separation between temperature and\npolarization. However, noting that pairs of detectors within a single horn are\nstrongly anti-correlated, we anticipate that solving for horn maps, as opposed\nto individual detector maps, may provide an optimal compromise between noise\nand temperature-to-polarization leakage minimization. When applied to simulated\ndata with a rotating half-wave plate, for which the polarization angle coverage\nis greatly improved, the algorithm performs as expected."}

Photons traversing\nmagnetized regions can convert into ALPs, producing characteristic,\nenergy-dependent absorption features in astrophysical spectra. The probability\nof such conversions depends sensitively on both the photon energy and the\nproperties of the intervening magnetic fields.\n  Most existing searches have focused on individual astrophysical sources, but\nuncertainties in the structure and strength of cosmic magnetic fields have\nlimited their reach. Recently, we have demonstrated that active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs) observed through galaxy clusters provide especially promising targets\nfor ALP searches. By stacking multiple AGN-cluster sightlines, one can average\nover poorly known magnetic field configurations in galaxy clusters and recover\na distinctive ALP-induced spectral suppression, thereby significantly enhancing\nsensitivity.\n  In this work, we investigate a possible systematic uncertainty in such\nanalyses: the intrinsic time-variability of AGN spectra. We demonstrate that\nAGN flux variability is correlated with spectral hardness, and that\ntime-averaging over flaring and quiescent states can potentially mimic the\nsuppression features imprinted by ALP-photon mixing.

The star formation activity in NGC 3281 is\ninsufficient to explain its $\\gamma$-ray luminosity based on the empirical\nrelation between the infrared and $\\gamma$-ray luminosities observed in other\nsources. The multiwavelength spectrum can be explained as due to inverse\nCompton scattering by relativistic electrons in the corona or jet of seed\nphotons from the corona, disk and torus. The source is Compton-thick and\nattenuation of GeV photons due to pair production in the corona is\nnonnegligible (with an optical depth of about 10). The intrinsic $\\gamma$-ray\nluminosity is inferred to be $3.4\\,\\times10^{42}$ and\n$2.2\\,\\times10^{41}\\rm\\,erg\\,s^{-1}$ for the corona and jet model,\nrespectively. The observed $\\gamma$-ray and radio luminosities is roughly\nconsistent with the known correlation between the two quantities, among the\nlowest luminosity regime. The jet origin is valid only if the radio emission is\ndominated by the jet."}

One-loop Closure", "categories": ["cond-mat.stat-mech", "astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "26 pages, 16 figures, submitted to APS", "summary": "We use stellar dynamics as a testbed for statistical closure theory. We focus\non the process of \"Vector Resonant Relaxation,\" a long-range, non-linear, and\ncorrelated relaxation mechanism that drives the reorientation of stellar\norbital planes around a supermassive black hole. This process provides a\nnatural setting to evaluate the predictive power of generic statistical closure\nschemes for dynamical correlation functions, in the fully non-linear and\nnon-perturbative regime. We develop a numerical scheme that explicitly\nimplements the seminal \"Martin-Siggia-Rose\" formalism at one-loop order via an\niterative fixed-point approach, thereby improving upon the bare order from the\n\"Direct Interaction Approximation.\" Using this framework, we quantitatively\nvalidate the ability of the formalism to predict (i) the two-point two-time\ncorrelation function; (ii) the renormalised three-point interaction vertex;\n(iii) the three-point three-time correlation function. These predictions are\ncompared to direct measurements from numerical simulations. We conclude by\ndiscussing the limitations of this approach and presenting possible future\nvenues."}

First, because\nthese populations are where they are readily found and because, according to\ncanonical stellar evolution models for isolated stars, these are the only\npopulations where RR Lyrae should exist. Recent independent results, however,\nare challenging this view and pointing at the existence of intermediate-age RR\nLyrae, only a few (2--5) Gyrs old. Our goal in this work is to provide direct\nevidence of the existence of intermediate-age RR Lyrae by searching for these\nstars in Milky Way open clusters, where the age association will be direct and\nrobust. We searched over 3,000 open clusters with published kinematically\nassociated member stars from the Hunt & Reffert database by crossmatching\nagainst a compilation of the largest publicly available RR Lyrae surveys\n(\\Gaia, ASAS-SN, PanStarrs1, Zwicky Transient Factory and OGLE-IV).\n  We identified a star as a bona fide RR~Lyrae variable and robust member of\nthe 2--4 Gyr old Trumpler 5 cluster, based on its parallax and proper motions\nand their agreement with confirmed cluster members. We derived an extremely low\nprobability ($0.049\\pm 0.013$%) that the star is a background field RR~Lyrae\nand provide initial constraints on a possible binary companion based on its\nposition in the colour-absolute magnitude diagram. Currently a source of\ndebate, the Trumpler~5 RR Lyrae provides the most direct evidence to date of\nthe existence of RR Lyrae stars at much younger ages than traditionally\nexpected and adds to the mounting evidence supporting their existence."}

We refer to this phenomenon as the ``swift\nmemory burden effect\" and show that it is universal for objects of high\nefficiency of information storage. The effect is expected to have observable\nmanifestations, for example, in mergers of astrophysical black holes in\nEinstein gravity. The black holes with different information loads, although\ndegenerate in the ground state, respond very differently to perturbations. The\nstrength of the imprint is controlled by the memory burden parameter which\nmeasures the fraction of the black hole's memory space occupied by the\ninformation load. This represents a new macroscopic quantum characteristics of\na black hole. We develop a calculable theoretical framework and derive some\nmaster formulas which we then test on explicit models of black holes as well as\non solitons of high capacity of information storage. We show that the effect\nmust be significant for the spectroscopy of both astrophysical and primordial\nblack holes and can be potentially probed in gravitational wave experiments. We\nalso provide a proposal for the test of the memory burden phenomenon in a\ntable-top laboratory setting with cold bosons."}

A\nsignificant fraction of these sources with counterparts in the Gaia DR3 catalog\nare found to be distant ($>$100 pc) low-mass stars, where their large\ntangential velocities and placement on color-magnitude diagrams suggest that\nthey are likely low-metallicity M-type subdwarfs. Optical spectroscopy is used\nto confirm the low-mass and low-metallicity for two such sources. Using\navailable optical and infrared photometry, we estimate the spectral type for\nall non-Gaia sources and find 10 likely late-M dwarfs, 15 objects with colors\nmost consistent with L-type dwarfs, and 9 possible T-type dwarfs. Follow-up\nspectroscopy is needed to confirm spectral types and further characterize these\nnew discoveries."}
