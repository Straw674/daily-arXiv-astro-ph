They can be identified as quasars with\nperiodic variability in electromagnetic (EM) time-domain surveys. The most\nmassive of those systems can be detected by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) in the\nnanohertz frequency gravitational-wave (GW) band. We present a method to\nsimultaneously analyze EM lightcurves and PTA observations as a multi-messenger\ndata stream. For this, we employ a joint likelihood analysis, in which the\nlikelihood of the EM data and the PTA likelihood are multiplied. We test this\napproach by simulating 208 binary signals that can be detected both by the\nRubin Observatory in the nominal ten-year survey and by a PTA dataset with a\n~30-year baseline, which resembles our expectations for a dataset of the\nInternational Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) collaboration in ~2035. We compare our\nmulti-messenger analysis with analyses that take into account the EM and PTA\ndata separately. We find that the joint likelihood approach results in improved\nparameter estimation with smaller percent errors compared to the distinct\nanalyses that consider only EM or PTA data separately. Among the SMBHB\nparameters, the binary total mass and the orbital inclination show the greatest\nimprovement. We also compare our multi-messenger pipeline with an analysis, in\nwhich the EM constraints are used as priors to the PTA analysis. We demonstrate\nthat the joint likelihood approach delivers tighter constraints on all binary\nparameters, with systematically higher values of Kullback-Leibler divergence,\nwhich measures the deviation of the posterior distribution from the prior."}

We created an innovative dynamical model\nwith minimal assumptions on the internal dynamical structures and accommodates\na highly flexible triaxial DM halo. By applying the method to 6D phase-space\ndata of K-giant stars from LAMOST + Gaia, we robustly determine the 3D\ndark-matter distribution of the Milky Way out to approximately 50 kpc. We\ndiscover a triaxial, nearly oblate dark-matter halo with $q_{\\rm DM} = Z/X=\n0.92\\pm0.08$, $p_{\\rm DM} = Y/X= 0.8\\pm0.2$ averagely within 50 kpc, where $Z$\naxis is defined perpendicular to the stellar disk. The axes ratio $q_{\\rm DM} >\np_{\\rm DM}$ is strongly preferred; the long-intermediate axis plane of the\ndark-matter halo is unexpectedly vertical to the Galactic disk, yet aligned\nwith the `plane of satellites'. This striking configuration suggests that the\nGalactic disk has flipped, likely torqued by minor mergers, from an original\nalignment with the dark-matter halo and satellite plane, as supported by Milky\nWay analogues from Auriga and TNG 50. By allowing $q_{\\rm DM}(r)$ and $p_{\\rm\nDM}(r)$ vary with radii, we find tentative evidence that the dark-matter halo\nis twisted, being more oblate in the inner regions, and only become vertically\naligned at $r\\gtrsim 20$ kpc, also consistent with the prediction of the disk\nflip scenario. Such disk reorientation is non-trivial yet its physical\nmechanism is straightforward to comprehend and naturally originates a vertical\nsatellite plane. Our findings offer a unified framework that links dark-matter\nhalo orientation, satellite alignment, and disk evolution, reinforcing the\ninternal consistency of the Milky Way in $\\Lambda$CDM model."}

Comments\n  welcome", "summary": "The Milky Way (MW) is thought to have experienced a $\\sim$3:1 mass-ratio\nmerger event near redshift $z\\sim2$ with a significantly retrograde trajectory.\nThis now-disrupted dwarf galaxy is commonly known as the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus\n(GSE). In this paper, we investigate the impact of the GSE merger trajectory on\nmetal abundances in the MW disk. We construct numerical models of Galactic\nchemical evolution (GCE) incorporating radial gas flows to account for angular\nmomentum transport during the merger event. Unlike prograde trajectories,\nradial and retrograde mergers are generally accompanied by a major sinking\nevent in which much of the interstellar medium falls toward the Galactic\ncenter. This effect leads to a net decrease in surface density across much of\nthe disk. Ongoing Type Ia supernova explosions then drive a rapid decline in\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] due to the lowered gas supply. Consequently, radial and\nretrograde trajectories increase (decrease) the number of low (high)\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations relative to prograde trajectories. If high\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] stars form in sufficient numbers through other mechanisms, the\neffect of the retrograde trajectory can produce a bimodal [$\\alpha$/Fe]\ndistribution at fixed [Fe/H], as observed in the MW. In models dominated by low\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations, a bimodality does not arise because the\nretrograde trajectory cannot increase the number of high [$\\alpha$/Fe] stars.\nMore broadly, our results highlight the importance of gas dynamics in GCE\nmodels featuring major merger events."}

This paper investigates the differences in abundance\nevolution between metal and non-metal isotopes using recent models of Galactic\nchemical evolution appropriate for the thin disk epoch. A strong degeneracy\narises between metal yields from stellar populations and the mean\nGalactocentric radial velocity of the interstellar medium (ISM). Similar\nmetallicities arise when increases (decreases) in metal yields are combined\nwith increases (decreases) to the gas flow velocity. A similar degeneracy\nexists between metal yields and the rate of gas ejection from the ISM. We\ndemonstrate that this degeneracy can be confidently broken with precise\nmeasurements of the hydrogen (D/H) and helium ($^3$He/$^4$He) isotope ratios in\nthe Galactic ISM. At fixed O/H, higher metal yields lead to higher D/H and\nlower $^3$He/$^4$He. Measurements available to date are not sufficiently\nprecise or numerous to draw confident conclusions. A detailed inventory of\nnon-metal isotopes in the Milky Way would provide critical empirical\nconstraints for stellar and galactic astrophysics, as well as a new test of Big\nBang Nucleosynthesis.

To this end, we have created the Cosmology Likelihood for Observables\nin Euclid (CLOE), which is a novel cosmological parameter inference pipeline\ndeveloped within the Euclid Consortium to translate measurements and\ncovariances into cosmological parameter constraints. In this first in a series\nof six papers, we describe the theoretical recipe of this code for the Euclid\nprimary probes. These probes are composed of the photometric 3x2pt observables\nof cosmic shear, galaxy-galaxy lensing, and galaxy clustering, along with\nspectroscopic galaxy clustering. We provide this description in both Fourier\nand configuration space for standard and extended summary statistics, including\nthe wide range of systematic uncertainties that affect them. This includes\nsystematic uncertainties such as intrinsic galaxy alignments, baryonic\nfeedback, photometric and spectroscopic redshift uncertainties, shear\ncalibration uncertainties, sample impurities, photometric and spectroscopic\ngalaxy biases, as well as magnification bias. The theoretical descriptions are\nfurther able to accommodate both Gaussian and non-Gaussian likelihoods and\nextended cosmologies with non-zero curvature, massive neutrinos, evolving dark\nenergy, and simple forms of modified gravity. These theoretical descriptions\nthat underpin CLOE will form a crucial component in revealing the true nature\nof the Universe with next-generation cosmological surveys such as Euclid."}

X-ray observations, primarily from Chandra\nand XMM-Newton, have revealed a wealth of information about the thermodynamics\nof this gas. However, two regimes remain difficult to study with current\ninstruments: superheated gas well above 10~keV generated by shocks from major\nmergers, and distant systems strongly impacted by cosmological dimming.\nRelativistic corrections to the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (rSZe) produce a\nfractional spectral distortion in the cosmic microwave background at\nsub-millimeter and millimeter wavelengths that could offer a complimentary\nprobe of both high temperature and high redshift ICM gas. Here we describe\nmulti-band measurements of the rSZe, including observations from the Fourier\nTransform Spectrometer on the Herschel-SPIRE instrument, that constrain the ICM\nthermodynamics of the major merger MACSJ0717.5+3745. Within the seven observed\nlines of sight, we find an average temperature of\n$T_{\\mathrm{rSZe}}=15.1^{+3.8}_{-3.3}$ keV, which is consistent with the values\nobtained from X-ray measurements of the same regions, with\n$T_{\\mathrm{Chandra}}=18.0^{+1.1}_{-1.1}$ keV and\n$T_{\\mathrm{XMM}}=13.9^{+0.9}_{-0.9}$ keV.

In the current era of multi-wavelength and multi-messenger\nastronomy, international organisations are actively working on the definition\nof new standards for the publication of astronomical data, and substantial\neffort is devoted to make them available through public archives. Aims. We\npresent a set of tools that allow user-friendly access and basic scientific\nanalysis of observations in Hierarchical Progressive Survey (HiPS) format, and\nwe use them to gauge the quality of representative skymaps at ultraviolet,\noptical, and infrared wavelengths. Methods. We apply a fully-automatic\nprocedure to derive aperture photometry in 10 different bands for the 323\nnearby galaxies in the Herschel Reference Sample (HRS), and compare its results\nwith the rigorous analyses involving specialised knowledge and human\nintervention carried out by the HRS team. Results. Our experiment shows that 9\nof the 10 skymaps considered preserve the original quality of the data, and the\nphotometric fluxes returned by our pipeline are consistent with the HRS\nmeasurements within a few per cent. In the case of Herschel PACS maps at 100\n{\\mu}m, we uncovered a systematic error that we ascribe to an inconsistent\ncombination of data products with different spatial resolution. For the\nremaining skymaps, the estimated statistical uncertainties provide a realistic\nindication of the differences with respect to the HRS catalogue. Conclusions.\nIn principle, the currently available HiPS skymaps in Flexible Image Transport\nSystem (FITS) format allow to carry out broadband photometric analyses with an\naccuracy of the order of a few percent, but some level human intervention is\nstill required. In addition to assessing data quality, we also propose a series\nof recommendations to realise the full potential of the HiPS format for the\nscientific analysis of large astronomical data sets."}

In this paper, we investigate the accuracy\nof the calculations performed by the Cosmology Likelihood for Observables in\nEuclid (CLOE), a software able to handle both the modelling of observables and\ntheir fit against observational data for both the photometric and spectroscopic\nsurveys of Euclid, by comparing the output of CLOE with external codes used as\nbenchmark. We perform such a comparison on the quantities entering the\ncalculations of the observables, as well as on the final outputs of these\ncalculations. Our results highlight the high accuracy of CLOE when comparing\nits calculation against external codes for Euclid observables on an extended\nrange of operative cases. In particular, all the summary statistics of interest\nalways differ less than $0.1\\,\\sigma$ from the chosen benchmark, and CLOE\npredictions are statistically compatible with simulated data obtained from\nbenchmark codes. The same holds for the comparison of correlation function in\nconfiguration space for spectroscopic and photometric observables."}

Specifically, its goal is to shed\nlight on the nature of dark matter and dark energy. Achieving this requires\ndeveloping and validating advanced statistical tools and theoretical prediction\nsoftware capable of testing extensions of the LCDM model. In this work, we\ndescribe how the Euclid likelihood pipeline, Cosmology Likelihood for\nObservables in Euclid (CLOE), has been extended to accommodate alternative\ncosmological models and to refine the theoretical modelling of Euclid primary\nprobes. In particular, we detail modifications made to CLOE to incorporate the\nmagnification bias term into the spectroscopic two-point correlation function\nof galaxy clustering. Additionally, we explain the adaptations made to CLOE's\nimplementation of Euclid primary photometric probes to account for massive\nneutrinos and modified gravity extensions. Finally, we present the validation\nof these CLOE modifications through dedicated forecasts on synthetic\nEuclid-like data by sampling the full posterior distribution and comparing with\nthe results of previous literature. In conclusion, we have identified in this\nwork several functionalities with regards to beyond-LCDM modelling that could\nbe further improved within CLOE, and outline potential research directions to\nenhance pipeline efficiency and flexibility through novel inference and machine\nlearning techniques."}

This mechanism activates after gas expulsion and\nremains effective until the cloud is disrupted by stellar feedback or the\ncluster moves away.

So, it is of interest to measure the Hubble constant by\nusing some new probes independent of cosmic microwave background (CMB) and type\nIa supernovae (SNIa). One of the promising probes is the fast radio bursts\n(FRBs), which could be useful in cosmology. In the literature, the methodology\nproposed by Macquart {\\it et al.} has been widely used, in which both $\\rm\nDM_{IGM}$ and $\\rm DM_{host}$ are described by probability distribution\nfunctions. Recently, it was found that in order to obtain a Hubble constant\n$H_0$ consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES by using the current\n${\\cal O}(100)$ localized FRBs, an unusually large $f_{\\rm IGM}$ fairly close\nto its upper bound $1$ is required, if the narrow prior bounded by $0.5$ for\nthe parameter $F$ in the distribution of $\\rm DM_{IGM}$ was used. In fact, a\nsmall $F$ is the key to make $H_0$ larger. In the present work, we consider a\nloose prior for the parameter $F$, and find an unusually low $H_0$ by using 125\nlocalized FRBs. We show that the model with loose $F$ prior is strongly\npreferred over the one with narrow $F$ prior in all terms of the Bayesian\nevidence and the information criteria AIC, BIC. So, the great Hubble tension\nbetween FRBs, Planck 2018 and SH0ES should be taken seriously. Instead of\nmodifying $\\sigma_\\Delta=Fz^{-0.5}$ in the distribution of $\\rm DM_{IGM}$, here\nwe try to find a new way out by generalizing the distribution of $\\rm\nDM_{host}$ with varying location and scale parameters $\\ell$ and $e^\\mu$,\nrespectively. We find that $H_0$ can be consistent with the ones of Planck 2018\nand SH0ES in all cases. All the Bayesian evidence and the information criteria\nAIC, BIC for the generalized distributions of $\\rm DM_{host}$ are\noverwhelmingly strong."}

Modeling the cold Hubble flow around the group center of mass, we\nderive a corresponding value of the Hubble constant as $68 \\pm\n5~\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$. These results offer an independent,\ndynamically motivated constraint on the local value of $H_0$, explicitly\naccounting for the impact of peculiar velocities in the nearby Universe. We\nalso discuss the mild tension between the virial and Hubble flow-based mass\nestimates, which likely arises from the fact that M83 is close to the velocity\nsurface and breaks the Hubble flow model assumptions. While the Hubble flow fit\nemphasizes galaxies that follow smooth expansion on the lower branch of the\nvelocity-distance relation, the virial estimate includes the broader spread of\nbound galaxies near the group core, which seems to fit better for the CenA/M83\ntotal mass."}

By\nintroducing tracer particles to precisely track the forces acting on the gas\nduring its evolution towards and within the clouds, we are able to quantify how\nmuch of the mass inflow is driven by the self-gravity of the gas and the\ngravity from the stellar disk. We find that up to 20% of the gas is\ngravity-driven at a scale of 100 pc, contributing 10% of the inflow from the\nwarm to the cold phase and 20% from the cold phase to the individual molecular\nclouds, reaching up to 45% inside the molecular gas, at densities $\\gtrsim 400$\ncm$^{-3}$.

One of the promising probes is the fast radio bursts\n(FRBs), which could be useful in cosmology. In the literature, the methodology\nproposed by Macquart {\\it et al.} has been widely used, in which both $\\rm\nDM_{IGM}$ and $\\rm DM_{host}$ are described by probability distribution\nfunctions. Recently, it was found that in order to obtain a Hubble constant\n$H_0$ consistent with the ones of Planck 2018 and SH0ES by using the current\n${\\cal O}(100)$ localized FRBs, an unusually large $f_{\\rm IGM}$ fairly close\nto its upper bound $1$ is required, if the narrow prior bounded by $0.5$ for\nthe parameter $F$ in the distribution of $\\rm DM_{IGM}$ was used. In fact, a\nsmall $F$ is the key to make $H_0$ larger. In the present work, we consider a\nloose prior for the parameter $F$, and find an unusually low $H_0$ by using 125\nlocalized FRBs.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of the GSE merger trajectory on\nmetal abundances in the MW disk. We construct numerical models of Galactic\nchemical evolution (GCE) incorporating radial gas flows to account for angular\nmomentum transport during the merger event. Unlike prograde trajectories,\nradial and retrograde mergers are generally accompanied by a major sinking\nevent in which much of the interstellar medium falls toward the Galactic\ncenter. This effect leads to a net decrease in surface density across much of\nthe disk. Ongoing Type Ia supernova explosions then drive a rapid decline in\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] due to the lowered gas supply. Consequently, radial and\nretrograde trajectories increase (decrease) the number of low (high)\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations relative to prograde trajectories. If high\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] stars form in sufficient numbers through other mechanisms, the\neffect of the retrograde trajectory can produce a bimodal [$\\alpha$/Fe]\ndistribution at fixed [Fe/H], as observed in the MW. In models dominated by low\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] stellar populations, a bimodality does not arise because the\nretrograde trajectory cannot increase the number of high [$\\alpha$/Fe] stars.\nMore broadly, our results highlight the importance of gas dynamics in GCE\nmodels featuring major merger events."}

Specifically, we detect enhanced\ntransmission at transverse distances of $\\Delta r \\sim 0.8$ times the mean free\npath, consistent with ionizing photons escaping preferentially along\nlarge-scale structures that are aligned with, but offset from, the line of\nsight. This anisotropic escape may contribute to the observed patchiness of\nreionization and challenges the assumption of isotropic ionized bubble growth\nin current models."}
