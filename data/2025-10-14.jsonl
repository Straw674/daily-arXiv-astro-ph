Using VLA radio observations, we image the radio\nemission of the four dwarf galaxies and derive their integrated radio flux and\nluminosity.

We find that one out of\nthe four galaxies shows AGN radio emission consistent with the analysis of the\nMaNGA IFU data. The kinetic jet power of this source is Qjet ~ 1e42 erg / s,\nindicating that dwarf galaxies can host radio jets as powerful as those of\nmassive radio galaxies. This galaxy exhibits an AGN outflow able to escape the\ngravitational bound produced by the dark matter halo, along with a decrease in\nthe star formation rate of the central region.

The goal is to evaluate and synthesize existing\nresearch to identify effective methodologies, highlight gaps, and propose\nfuture research directions. Our review identifies several key findings: (1)\nvarious machine learning techniques, including Bayesian neural networks,\nGaussian processes, and deep learning models, have been applied to cosmological\ndata analysis, improving parameter estimation and handling large datasets.\nHowever, models achieving significant computational speedups often exhibit\nworse confidence regions compared to traditional methods, emphasizing the need\nfor future research to enhance both efficiency and measurement precision. (2)\nTraditional cosmological methods, such as those using Type Ia Supernovae,\nbaryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic microwave background data, remain\nfundamental, but most studies focus narrowly on specific datasets. We recommend\nbroader dataset usage to fully validate alternative cosmological models. (3)\nThe reviewed studies mainly address the $H_0$ tension, leaving other\ncosmological challenges-such as the cosmological constant problem, warm dark\nmatter, phantom dark energy, and others-unexplored. (4) Hybrid methodologies\ncombining machine learning with Markov chain Monte Carlo offer promising\nresults, particularly when machine learning techniques are used to solve\ndifferential equations, such as Einstein Boltzmann solvers, as prior to Markov\nchain Monte Carlo models, accelerating computations while maintaining\nprecision. (5) There is a significant need for standardized evaluation criteria\nand methodologies, as variability in training processes and experimental setups\ncomplicates result comparability and reproducibility (abridged)."}

With the accuracy\nand completeness of data from Gaia Data Release 3, we now have new\nopportunities to detect reliable members of stellar groups across a larger\nfield of view than in previous studies. In this work, using machine learning\nmethods and high-accuracy data, we investigate the possibility of detecting\nmultiple structures within 500 arcmin of ASCC 32. We first applied DBSCAN to\nproper motion and parallax, as multiple structures tend to share similar values\nfor these parameters. Next, we applied GMM to position, proper motion, and\nparallax for the members detected by DBSCAN. This approach allowed us to\nidentify a filamentary structure among the DBSCAN-detected members. This\nstructure contains all stellar groups previously identified in this region.\nSubsequently, based on the BIC score, we applied GMM to this filamentary\nstructure. Since multiple structures exhibit distinct positional distributions,\nGMM was able to effectively separate all groups within the filament. Our\nmethods successfully identified ASCC 32, OC 0395, and HSC 1865 within a 500\narcmin radius. Additionally, we found two distinct substructures within ASCC\n32. These four groups exhibit a single main-sequence distribution in the CMD,\nwith proper motion values within three times the standard deviation and\nslightly differing parallax values, despite having distinct spatial structures.\nFurthermore, these four groups share the same radial velocity distribution.

Modern\nsurveys are predominantly photometry-based, making the construction of a clean\nphotometric SNe Ia sample crucial. In this study, we investigate whether\nfunctional principal component analysis (FPCA) scores derived from photometric\nlight curves, combined with ensemble learning, can reliably distinguish SNe Ia\nfrom other transients using the PLAsTiCC dataset. FPCA provides a data-driven,\nflexible characterization of light curves without relying on rigid theoretical\nmodel assumptions. Light curves are fitted by minimizing residuals with penalty\nterms from clean samples, making the method robust to outliers or poorly\nsampled bands. The first two FPCA scores and peak magnitudes across the five\nLSST bands are used as classification features. We implement two complementary\nbinary classifiers: an ensemble boosting model (CatBoost) and a statistical\nprobabilistic method based on Euclidean distances. CatBoost slightly\noutperforms the statistical method, achieving 98.5% accuracy and 97.8%\nprecision. Performance remains robust (>90%) under typical photometric redshift\nuncertainties ({\\sigma} = 0.1). On the spectroscopic DES Y5 sample, both\nmethods reach approximately 90% accuracy and 95% precision, demonstrating\nstrong out-of-domain generalization compared to state-of-the-art methods with\nlimited cross-survey applicability.

Instead, their locations correlate with $\\mathcal{R}$\n$\\equiv$ $R_{CR}/R_{Bar}$: slow bars tend to show shorter dark gap radii, while\nfast bars show longer ones. This trend reflects a tight relation between bar\nlength and dark gap radius. However, when barred galaxies are classified by\ntheir ring morphology, certain types exhibit dark gaps that align with specific\nresonances.

Thus, by fitting Witt's Hyperbolae to several\nquartets of images - ten are known in Abell 1689 - the points of intersection\nprovide an estimate for the center for the assumed isothermal elliptical\npotential. We introduce a new figure of merit defined by the offset of the\ncenter of Wynne's Ellipse from Witt's Hyperbola.

Here in Paper\nII, we report an expansion of our X-ray and infrared analysis of\nSeyfert-luminosity host galaxies with four additional metrics to the\nsingle-metric morphology analysis of Paper I, as well as new samples of\ninactive control galaxies. This expanded study of one of the largest and most\ncomplete, multi-wavelength samples of AGN detected at $0.6<z<2.4$ in the\nGOODS-South and North fields, confirms that mergers surprisingly play a\nsignificant role in obscured, sub-quasar AGN host galaxies. Additionally, the\npattern of morphological disturbances observed amongst the X-ray- and\nmid-IR-selected AGN suggests that these represent different phases of AGN\nevolution tied to a major-merger timeline, as opposed to distinct populations\nof AGN. These results indicate that mergers are important in triggering\nsub-quasar AGN at these redshifts."}

The models predict that HD is mainly produced in\nthe gas phase via the reaction D + H2 = H + HD at the front edge of the PDR and\nthat the D/HD transition is located slightly closer to the edge than the H/H2\ntransition. Rovibrational levels are excited by UV pumping. In the\nobservations, HD rovibrational emission is detected close to the H/H2\ndissociation fronts of the Orion Bar and peaks where vibrationally excited H2\npeaks, rather than at the maximum emission of pure rotational H2 levels. We\nderive an excitation temperature around Tex ~ 480 - 710 K.

In this paper, we explore domain\nshift and test domain adaptation methods for a specific scientific case:\nsimulation-based inference for estimating galaxy cluster masses from X-ray\nprofiles. We build datasets to mimic simulation-based inference: a training set\nfrom the Magneticum simulation, a scatter-augmented training set to capture\nuncertainties in scaling relations, and a test set derived from the\nIllustrisTNG simulation. We demonstrate that the Test Set is out of domain in\nsubtle ways that would be difficult to detect without careful analysis. We\napply three deep learning methods: a standard neural network (NN), a neural\nnetwork trained on the scatter-augmented input catalogs, and a Deep\nReconstruction-Regression Network (DRRN), a semi-supervised deep model\nengineered to address domain shift. Although the NN improves results by 17% in\nthe Training Data, it performs 40% worse on the out-of-domain Test Set.\nSurprisingly, the Scatter-Augmented Neural Network (SANN) performs similarly.\nWhile the DRRN is successful in mapping the training and Test Data onto the\nsame latent space, it consistently underperforms compared to a straightforward\nYx scaling relation.

We examine\nhow neural networks complement classical statistics, extending our data\nanalytical toolkit for modern surveys. Astronomy offers unique opportunities\nthrough encoding physical symmetries, conservation laws, and differential\nequations directly into architectures, creating models that generalize beyond\ntraining data. Yet challenges persist as unlabeled observations number in\nbillions while confirmed examples with known properties remain scarce and\nexpensive. This review demonstrates how deep learning incorporates domain\nknowledge through architectural design, with built-in assumptions guiding\nmodels toward physically meaningful solutions. We evaluate where these methods\noffer genuine advances versus claims requiring careful scrutiny. - Neural\narchitectures overcome trade-offs between scalability, expressivity, and data\nefficiency by encoding physical symmetries and conservation laws into network\nstructure, enabling learning from limited labeled data. - Simulation-based\ninference and anomaly detection extract information from complex, non-Gaussian\ndistributions where analytical likelihoods fail, enabling field-level\ncosmological analysis and systematic discovery of rare phenomena. - Multi-scale\nneural modeling bridges resolution gaps in astronomical simulations, learning\neffective subgrid physics from expensive high-fidelity runs to enhance\nlarge-volume calculations where direct computation remains prohibitive. -\nEmerging paradigms-reinforcement learning for telescope operations, foundation\nmodels learning from minimal examples, and large language model agents for\nresearch automation-show promise though are still developing in astronomical\napplications."}

In this\nwork we develop the first analytic model of reionization which explicitly\nincorporates the MFP as a free parameter, allowing us to transparently explore\nits effect on the process. Our model is based on the excursion set formalism\nwith an ionization condition which accounts for absorptions parameterized\nthrough the MFP.

We find that the\neffect of the MFP is much more significant during the later stages of\nreionization, and that including a shorter MFP reduces the size of HII regions\nby around an order of magnitude towards the end of reionization compared with\nanalytic models which do not account for the MFP. We find that the reported MFP\nvalue produces a contrast in the 21-cm signal of $\\mathcal{O}$(1 mK) or less at\nresolutions $\\theta \\sim $ 15--35 arcmin, an order of magnitude below naive\nestimates and up to a factor of several smaller than when using a larger MFP\nvalue extrapolated from low $z$, requiring significantly more sensitivity for\nimaging.

Adaptive resolution, multi-physics, and\nhybrid numerical methods have enabled tremendous progress on the spatial,\nphysics, and numerical challenges involved. But often the limiter for following\nthe long timescales of global evolution is the extremely short numerical\ntimestep required in some subdomains (which leads to their dominating\nsimulation costs). Recently several approaches have been developed for tackling\nthis in problems where the short timescale solution is sampled and then\nprojected as an effective subgrid model over longer timescales (e.g. 'zooming\nin and out'). We generalize these to a family of models where time evolution is\nmodulated by a variable but continuous in space-and-time dilation/stretch\nfactor $a({\\bf x},\\,t)$. This extends previous well-studied approaches\n(including reduced-speed-of-light and binary orbital dynamics methods), and\nensures that the system comes to correct local steady-state solutions, and\nderive criteria that the dilation factor/timesteps/resolution must obey to\nensure good behavior. We present a variety of generalizations to different\nphysics or coupling scales. Compared to previous approaches, this method makes\nit possible to avoid imprinting arbitrary scales where there is no clear\nscale-separation, and couples well to Lagrangian or Eulerian methods. It is\nflexible and easily-implemented and we demonstrate its validity (and\nlimitations) in test problems. We discuss the relationship between these\nmethods and physical time dilation in GRMHD.

We demonstrate that the essential of soliton formation mechanism is\nthe sound mode instability induced by thermodynamic instability. This\ninstability triggers phase separation, where new thermal phases are generated\nto produce solitons. These solitons can be regarded as a coexistence state\ncomposed of a matter phase and a vacuum phase, with an interface proving\nsurface tension to maintain dynamical equilibrium. The phase separation\nmechanism naturally allows the existence of vacuum bubbles, characterized by a\nvacuum phase surrounded by a matter phase with negative pressure. Furthermore,\nwe show that the soliton interface resemble a fluid membrane, whose interface\npressure satisfies a Young-Laplace-type relation, resulting in the emergence of\nthe membrane instability induced by surface tension. In the thin-wall limit,\nthe dispersion relation is analytically derived. This instability triggers\ntopological transition of the interface, splitting a cylindrical interface into\nmultiple spheres with a smaller total surface area. Such results highlight the\nduality between solitons and fluids."}

We examine\nhow neural networks complement classical statistics, extending our data\nanalytical toolkit for modern surveys. Astronomy offers unique opportunities\nthrough encoding physical symmetries, conservation laws, and differential\nequations directly into architectures, creating models that generalize beyond\ntraining data. Yet challenges persist as unlabeled observations number in\nbillions while confirmed examples with known properties remain scarce and\nexpensive. This review demonstrates how deep learning incorporates domain\nknowledge through architectural design, with built-in assumptions guiding\nmodels toward physically meaningful solutions. We evaluate where these methods\noffer genuine advances versus claims requiring careful scrutiny. - Neural\narchitectures overcome trade-offs between scalability, expressivity, and data\nefficiency by encoding physical symmetries and conservation laws into network\nstructure, enabling learning from limited labeled data. - Simulation-based\ninference and anomaly detection extract information from complex, non-Gaussian\ndistributions where analytical likelihoods fail, enabling field-level\ncosmological analysis and systematic discovery of rare phenomena. - Multi-scale\nneural modeling bridges resolution gaps in astronomical simulations, learning\neffective subgrid physics from expensive high-fidelity runs to enhance\nlarge-volume calculations where direct computation remains prohibitive. -\nEmerging paradigms-reinforcement learning for telescope operations, foundation\nmodels learning from minimal examples, and large language model agents for\nresearch automation-show promise though are still developing in astronomical\napplications."}

With a combined calibration, we capture small-scale physics of\nprimordial star formation over a large range in halo mass.
