This makes them\nexcellent probes for understanding dark matter and galaxy evolution.

Our simulations show that dwarf galaxies\ninitially form as compact galaxies ($R_e < 2$ kpc). However, several of these\ngalaxies ($54\\%$) experience periods of gradual size growth at relatively\nstable sSFR, allowing them to become extended galaxies. We find that the growth\nof rotation-supported stellar disks is the primary means by which isolated\ndwarfs become extended in size. These stellar disks are formed by mergers with\nhigh orbital angular momentum satellites on high angular momentum\n(spiraling-in) orbits, which spin up the gas surrounding the central galaxy and\ncontribute $\\approx 30 \\%$ of the cold gas mass at $z=0$.

At high-redshift, when galaxies are\nrapidly assembling, feedback-driven outflows and turbulence can strongly\nreshape radial metallicity gradients. In this work, we use the FIRE-2, SPICE,\nThesan and Thesan Zoom cosmological simulations -- spanning a range of stellar\nfeedback from bursty (time-variable) to smooth (steady) -- to investigate how\nthese feedback modes shape gas-phase metallicity gradients at $3<z\\lesssim11$.\nAcross all models, we find that galaxies with bursty feedback (FIRE-2, SPICE\nBursty, and Thesan Zoom) develop systematically flatter (factors of $\\sim2-10$)\nmetallicity gradients than those with smooth feedback (SPICE Smooth and Thesan\nBox), particularly at stellar masses $M_\\star > 10^{9}~{\\rm M_\\odot}$. These\nresults demonstrate that bursty stellar feedback provides sufficient turbulence\nto prevent strong negative gradients from forming, while smooth stellar\nfeedback does not generically allow for efficient radial redistribution of\nmetals thereby keeping gradients steep.

We\nalso report a universal expression for the discreteness-noise-driven scatter in\nthe bound-mass fraction of subhalos that depends only on the subhalo mass\nresolution at infall and the instantaneous bound mass fraction, agnostic of any\nfurther subhalo properties. Such stochastic discreteness noise causes both\npremature disruption and, notably, spurious survival of poorly mass-resolved\nsubhalos.

These bands exhibit consistent peak\nwavelengths and profiles in diverse sources, and ISO SWS and JWST spectra show\na nearly identical red wing of the 3.3 mic AIB and blue wing of the 11.2 mic\nAIB in the dominant Class A sources. This spectral uniformity suggests that the\nAIBs arise from a small, well-defined set of gas phase PAH species, regardless\nof the excitation conditions or the nature of the source such as HII regions,\nreflection nebulae, planetary nebula, young stellar objects, or the diffuse\ninterstellar medium. However, a small number of gas phase PAH species is\ninconsistent with current modeling of the AIBs that require a wide range of PAH\ntypes and sizes.

Traditional approaches typically rely on numerical\nintegration and interpolation to detect these crossings, which can lead to\ninaccuracies and computational inefficiencies. This work presents a novel\nmethodology for constructing Poincar\\'e maps based on the Theory of Functional\nConnections (TFC). The constrained functionals produced by TFC yield continuous\nand differentiable representations of system trajectories that exactly satisfy\nprescribed constraints. The computation of Poincar\\'e maps is formulated as\neither an initial value problem (IVP) or a boundary value problem (BVP). For\nIVPs, initial conditions are embedded into the functional, and the intersection\ntime with a specified section surface is determined. We demonstrate linear\nconvergence to the Taylor series, thereby enabling accurate interpolation\nwithout resorting to numerical integration or external optimization. For BVPs,\nperiodicity conditions are encoded to identify periodic orbits in a Three-Body\nProblem context. Furthermore, by enforcing periodic constraints, we show how to\nconstruct first recurrence maps. The methodology is also extended to\nnon-autonomous systems, demonstrated through applications to a Four-Body\nProblem. The proposed approach achieves machine-level accuracy with modest\ncomputational effort, eliminating the need for variable transformations or\niterative integration schemes with adaptive step-sizing. The results illustrate\nthat TFC offers a powerful and efficient alternative framework for constructing\nPoincar\\'e maps, computing periodic orbits, and analyzing complex dynamical\nsystems, particularly in astrodynamical contexts."}

Introducing a third species (e.g., CH$_4$) makes temperature a\ncritical factor, with stacking becoming inappropriate across the CO/CH$_4$\nboundary. Surface gravity exerts only a minor influence when stacking within\ncomparable planetary regimes. We further assess the number of stacked, distinct\nsub-Neptunes with high-metallicity atmospheres and low-pressure cloud decks\nrequired to rule out a flat spectrum at $>5\\sigma$, as a function of both cloud\ndeck pressure and per-planet spectral precision. These results provide guidance\non when stacking is useful and on how to interpret stacked exoplanet spectra in\nthe era of population studies of exoplanets."}

It is applied to several classes of\n$\\alpha$-attractor models as an illustrative example. In the first step, all\nindependent parameters of the inflationary potential are expressed in terms of\nthe CMB observables (the three parameters - by the scalar spectral index $n_s$,\nscalar amplitude $A_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar amplitude ratio $r$). For a\nstandard reheating mechanism characterized by the inflaton equation of state\nparameter $w$ and its effective dissipation rate $\\Gamma$ the reheating\ntemperature is uniquely fixed in terms of the CMB observables measured for some\npivot scale $k_*$. There are striking consequences of this fact. The model\nindependent bounds on the reheating temperature, the BBN lower bound and the\nupper bound of the order of the GUT/Planck scale, translate themselves for each\nclass of models into very narrow ranges of the allowed values of the spectral\nindex $n_s(k_*)$, providing their strong tests by the present and future CMB\ndata. The recent tension between Planck and DESI-ACT results has strong impact\non our conclusions. Furthermore, given a class of inflaton models satisfying\nthose tests, the reheating temperature is an interesting portal to link the CMB\nobservables to the particle physics scenarios that are sensitive to it. As an\nexample, non-thermal dark matter (DM) production mechanisms are discussed. One\nobtains then a consistency check between theories of inflation and DM\nproduction. If the future precision of the CMB data will constrain the\nreheating temperature beyond the model independent bounds, further constraints\non the DM production will follow."}

The relatively large tidal disruption radius of\nthe WD can result in non-negligible residual orbital eccentricity ($0 \\lesssim\ne \\lesssim 0.2$), causing episodic mass transfer, i.e., repeated tidal\ndisruptions (RPDs) of the WD. We perform smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics\nsimulations of RPDs in sixteen WD-BH/NS systems, capturing the subsequent mass\ntransfer and accretion. The WD undergoes RPDs near the orbital periastron,\nmodulating the ensuing accretion process, leading to variations of the\naccretion rate on the orbital period.
