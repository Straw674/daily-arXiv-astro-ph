In this paper, we show\nthat nearly parallel angular-momentum vectors may form stable bound pairs in\nangular-momentum space. We examine the stability of such pairs against an\nexternal massive perturber, and determine the critical separation analogous to\nthe Hill radius or tidal radius in the three-body problem, where the\nangular-momentum pairs are marginally disrupted, as a function of the\nperturber's mass, the orbital inclination, and the radial distance.\nAngular-momentum pairs or multiples closer than the critical inclination will\nremain bound and evolve together in angular-momentum-direction space under any\nexternal influence, such as anisotropic density fluctuations, or massive\nperturbers. This study has applications in various astrophysical contexts,\nincluding galactic nuclei, in particular the Milky Way's Galactic centre,\nglobular clusters, or planetary systems. In nuclear star clusters with a\ncentral super-massive black hole, we apply this criterion to the disc of young,\nmassive stars, and show that clusters in angular-momentum space may be used to\nconstrain the presence of intermediate-mass black holes or the mass of the\nnearby gaseous torus.", "AI": {"tldr": "发现球形势场中点质量系统的角动量向量可形成稳定束缚对，其临界分离与扰动体质量、轨道倾角和径向距离相关，对星系核等天体系统有重要应用。", "background": "研究球形势场中点质量系统中角动量向量的慢速重定向过程及其稳定成对现象。", "data": "使用球对称势场中的点质量系统模拟数据，分析角动量向量间的弱引力相互作用。", "method": "采用角动量空间中的稳定束缚对分析方法，研究平行角动量向量在外部扰动下的临界分离条件。", "result": "在球形势场中，角动量向量近乎平行的天体可形成稳定的角动量空间束缚对，其临界分离取决于扰动体质量、轨道倾角和径向距离。"}}

The data reveal a\nring-like morphology, with a radial peak located between those previously\nobserved at infrared wavelengths and longer millimetre observations.\nAdditionally, we detect a tentative outer shoulder in Band 9 that is not\nobserved at longer wavelengths. These findings suggest that small grains ($\\sim\n100 \\mu$m) traced by Band 9 may be escaping from the pressure bump both\nradially inwards and outwards, or may be tracing different disc layers than\nthose probed at longer wavelengths. A multi-wavelength analysis of the disc at\nmillimetre wavelengths and the best fit to the spectral energy distribution\nshows the presence of centimetre grains around the ring location, where the\ndust surface density also peaks, compatible with dust trap models. The grain\nsize in the disc cavity is not well constrained but is consistent with grains\nas small as 10 $\\mu$m, supporting the hypothesis that small dust grain filters\nthrough the cavity. We use dust evolution models to demonstrate that a\nturbulent viscosity of $\\alpha \\gtrsim 10^{-3}$ allows small grains to filter\nthrough the disc gap, while $\\alpha \\lesssim 5 \\times 10^{-3}$ is required to\nretain large grains in the pressure bump.

The light-curve asymmetries appear to be related to the stars'\nthird dredge-up (3DUP) activity. Aims: We aim to reveal the evolutionary status\nof M-type Miras with light-curve asymmetries ('bumps') within the spectral\nsequence M -- S -- C, determine their mass-loss properties, and check possible\nevolutionary scenarios. Methods: We analysed a sample of 3100 Miras collected\nfrom the ASAS database, distinguishing between symmetric and asymmetric light\ncurves. We determined their periods, luminosity functions, and\nperiod-luminosity relations, their locations relative to the Galactic midplane,\nas well as mass-loss rate indicators through the 2MASS-WISE colours and the\nGaia-2MASS diagram. Results: The M-type Miras with symmetric light curves are\ngenerally found to have shorter periods, lower luminosities, a larger average\ndistance to the Galactic midplane, and lower initial masses than the M-type\nMiras with asymmetries. In addition, 25 Miras are proposed as candidates for\nnew carbon stars. Conclusions: We propose that the M-type Miras have two\ndistinct populations: M-type Miras with symmetric light curves, which have\nlower initial mass progenitors than M-type Miras with asymmetries, which show\nsigns of 3DUP activity and are the link to the S-type Miras.", "AI": {"tldr": "发现M型米拉变星存在两个不同群体：光变曲线对称的群体初始质量较低，不对称的群体具有第三挖掘活动特征，是通向S型米拉变星的演化环节。", "background": "探讨M型米拉变星的光变曲线不对称性与其尘埃质量损失率及第三挖掘活动的关系，揭示其在M-S-C光谱序列中的演化状态。", "data": "数据来源于ASAS数据库的3100颗Mira变星样本，并结合了2MASS-WISE颜色和Gaia-2MASS图的质量损失率指标。", "method": "通过分析3100颗Mira变星的光变曲线不对称性，结合2MASS-WISE颜色和Gaia-2MASS图确定质量损失率指标。", "result": "M型米拉变星存在两个不同群体：具有对称光变曲线的群体初始质量较低，而具有不对称光变曲线的群体显示出第三挖掘活动迹象，是通向S型米拉变星的演化环节。"}}
