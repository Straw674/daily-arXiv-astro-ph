The stellar masses, specific star formation rates, and mass-weighted stellar ages of the simulated BGGs are analysed alongside those of observed BGGs from X-ray-selected galaxy groups in the COSMOS field. We find that the global properties and underlying evolutionary pathways of simulated BGG populations are strongly impacted by the strength and mechanism of their respective active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback models, which play a critical role in regulating the growth of massive galaxies. OBSIDIAN's sophisticated three-regime AGN feedback model achieves the highest overall agreement with COSMOS observations, matching stellar property distributions, quenched fractions, and the evolution of star formation in increasingly massive systems. We find evidence suggesting that BGG populations of OBSIDIAN and COSMOS undergo a gradual decline in star formation with stellar mass, in contrast to SIMBA and SIMBA-C, which display rapid quenching linked to the onset of powerful AGN jet feedback. By comparison, ROMULUS produces highly star-forming, under-quenched BGGs due to the inefficiency of its thermal AGN feedback in preventing cooling flows from fuelling BGG growth. The success of the OBSIDIAN simulation demonstrates the importance of physically motivated subgrid prescriptions for realistically capturing the processes that shape BGGs and their dynamic group environments."}

Observational constraints on this relation remain limited, particularly for low-mass groups, leaving uncertainties in how galaxies assemble their stars across halo mass scales. Accurately measuring the brightest central galaxy (BCG) stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) over a wide mass range is therefore crucial for understanding galaxy formation and the role of feedback processes. Here we present the SHMR spanning $M_{\\rm halo} \\sim 10^{12}$-$10^{15}\\,M_\\odot$, using halo masses derived from eROSITA eRASS1 X-ray data and BCG stellar masses based on SDSS photometry. By stacking X-ray spectra of optically selected groups, we recover robust average halo gas temperatures for each bin, which are then converted to halo masses via the $M$-$T_X$ relation. We find that the SHMR peaks near $M_{\\rm halo} \\sim 10^{12}\\,M_\\odot$, with a declining stellar fraction at higher masses. This trend reflects a combination of processes that reduce the efficiency of stellar mass growth in massive halos, such as AGN feedback, reduced cooling efficiency, and the increasing dominance of ex-situ assembly, while halos continue to grow through mergers and accretion. Our measurements are consistent over the full mass range with previous observational studies, including weak lensing, X-ray analyses of individual clusters, and kinematical and dynamical methods. Comparisons with hydrodynamical simulations show good agreement at low masses but reveal significant discrepancies in the normalization at cluster scales, highlighting the sensitivity of BCG stellar growth to feedback prescriptions and halo assembly history. These results provide the first X-ray-based observational SHMR covering three orders of magnitude in halo mass, establish a robust benchmark for testing galaxy formation models."}

All data were taken with the Keck II telescope and Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multiobject Spectrograph (DEIMOS) spectrograph using the 1200G grating (spectral resolution R~6000). Based on a uniform data reduction of 411 DEIMOS masks, we present a catalog of individual stellar radial velocities, equivalent width-based [Fe/H] metallicities, and membership estimates. The Milky Way satellites range from M_V = 2 to -14 (M* = 10^1.5 to 10^7.5 Msun); the majority of individual stars presented in these systems have magnitudes 17 > r > 22. The data were reduced to 1D spectra using PypeIt, which provides near Poisson statistics-level sky subtraction. Radial velocities were determined via dmost, a forward modeling method first presented here, which combines both synthetic telluric and stellar templates to determine stellar radial velocities. We assess the accuracy and precision our method via comparison to thousands of repeat measurements and literature values. We determine a velocity error floor of 1.1 km/s and a CaII triplet-based metallicity error floor of 0.1 dex. We calculate internal velocity dispersions and compare to literature values, demonstrating 20-50% improved precision over the literature in most cases. In a companion paper, we use our homogeneous catalogs to explore properties of these Milky Way satellites, including previously unpublished measurements in several systems including Bootes II and Draco II.

Systematic differences between data reduction pipelines and membership criteria can masquerade as astrophysical signals, or obscure real trends. Here, we present the largest self-consistent sample of spectroscopically-derived quantities for Milky Way satellite galaxies and globular clusters based on a homogeneous re-analysis of individual stars observed with the Keck/DEIMOS spectrograph. We determine enclosed dynamical masses, mean [Fe/H] metallicities, and metallicity dispersions for 67 systems with 10 or more member stars. At a given stellar mass, systems classified as satellite galaxies are well separated from globular clusters in their dynamical mass and mass-to-light ratios. The average enclosed mass densities of satellite galaxies agree with semi-analytic CDM model predictions. For satellite galaxies, we observe a break in the stellar mass-metallicity relation near log M*/Msun = 4 (M_V ~ -4.5). Above this stellar mass, satellite galaxies show the well-known tight trend (0.16 dex scatter in [Fe/H]) of decreasing metallicity with stellar mass; below log M*/Msun = 4, the mass-metallicity relation flattens and/or increases in scatter. Satellite galaxies have internal metallicity scatter between 0.3-0.4 dex across our stellar mass range. These uniform measurements will enable tighter constraints on the stellar mass-halo mass relation, improved J-factor estimates for dark matter searches, and lay a foundation for interpreting the flood of new Milky Way satellites expected in the LSST/Roman/Euclid era."}

[arXiv:2310.12859] claimed strong evidence for the statistical anisotropy of the universe. The claim is based on a joint analysis of four different anomaly tests of the cosmic microwave background data, each of which is known to be anomalous, with a lower level of significance. They reported a combined $p$-value of about $3\\times 10^{-8}$, which is more than a $5σ$ level of significance. We observe that statistical anisotropy is not even relevant for two of the four considered tests, which seems sufficient to invalidate the authors' claim. Furthermore, even if one reinterprets the claim as evidence against $Λ$CDM rather than statistical anisotropy, we argue that this result significantly suffers from the look-elsewhere effect. Assuming a set of independent (i.e., uncorrelated) tests, we show that if the four tests with the smallest $p$-values are cherry-picked from 10 independent tests, the $p$-value reported by Jones et al. corresponds to only $3σ$ significance. If there are 27 independent tests, the significance falls to $2σ$. These numbers, however, overstate our argument, since the four tests used by Jones et al. are slightly correlated. Determining the correlation of Jones et al.'s tests by comparing their joint $p$-value with the product of the four separate $p$-values, we find that about 16 or 50 tests are sufficient to reduce the significance of Jones et al.'s results to 3$σ$ or 2$σ$ significance, respectively. We also provide a list of anomaly tests discussed in the literature (and propose a few generalizations), suggesting that very plausibly 16 (or even 50) independent tests have been published, and possibly many more have been considered but not published. We conclude that the current data is consistent with the $Λ$CDM model and, in particular, with statistical isotropy."}

The observed detection rate of transient lensed stars -- individual, massive, thus luminous stars in strongly lensed galaxies that are temporarily detectable upon stellar microlensing -- can serve as a probe to break the IMF-star formation history degeneracy in studies utilizing spectral energy distribution fitting, hence providing a window to look at the IMF at a subsample of gravitationally lensed galaxies.

This white paper, prepared for the UK Space Frontiers 2035 call, outline five high-priority scientific questions addressing vortex generation mechanisms, cross-layer coupling, magnetic restructuring, collective wave-guidance structures, and their role in triggering explosive events and modulating the solar wind. Key observations and capabilities required to make significant advancements over the coming decade are identified. The UK solar physics community has established world-leading expertise in vortex dynamics, combining strengths in high-resolution observations, MHD turbulence theory, numerical modelling, and space instrumentation. UK researchers have made foundational contributions to Solar Orbiter, delivered critical systems for DKIST, and maintain active involvement in MUSE and SOLAR-C EUVST missions. Our technical approach centres on developing next-generation instrumentation: a multi-band, space-qualified system employing four tunable Fabry-Pérot Interferometers providing diffraction-limited, high-cadence spectropolarimetric coverage from the deep photosphere to the low corona. This capability will be validated through a staged mission architecture beginning with balloon-borne demonstrators. Continuing this effort over the coming decade is vital to maintain UK leadership in this field and achieve the goals of roadmap for solar system research."}

We also recover CEMP morphological Groups I-III in the Yoon-Beers diagram, as well as the recently proposed Group IV, and show that it is statistically distinct even in photometric data. A cumulative frequency analysis confirms that the CEMP fraction increases toward lower metallicity and that CEMP-no stars dominate in the most metal-poor regime.

Distinguishing between competing models that make similar predictions yet rely on fundamentally different principles, therefore requires suitably diverse physical tests.

Deep learning methods leverage pixel-level information from ground-based images to achieve the best photo-$z$'s for low-redshift galaxies, but their efficacy at higher redshifts with deep, space-based imaging remains largely untested. We used Hubble Space Telescope CANDELS optical and near-infrared imaging to evaluate fully-supervised, self-supervised, and semi-supervised deep learning photo-$z$ algorithms out to $z\\sim3$. Compared to template-based and classical machine learning photometry methods, the fully-supervised and semi-supervised models achieved better performance. Our new semi-supervised model, PITA (Photo-$z$ Inference with a Triple-loss Algorithm), outperformed all others by learning from unlabeled and labeled data through a three-part loss function that incorporates images and colors for all objects as well as redshifts when available. PITA produces a latent space that varies smoothly in magnitude, color, and redshift, resulting in the best photo-$z$ performance even when the redshift training set was significantly reduced. In contrast, the self-supervised approach produced a latent space with significant color and redshift fluctuations that hindered photo-$z$ inference. Looking forward to Roman, we recommend using semi supervised deep learning to take full advantage of the information contained in the hundreds of millions of high-resolution images and color measurements, together with the limited redshift measurements available, to achieve the most accurate photo-$z$ estimates for both faint and bright sources."}

Analogous to hydrogen in the Standard Model, these fermions interact via their own electromagnetic-like force, with a dark fine structure constant denoted by $α_{D}$, and can bind into neutral atomic (and molecular) dark states. Previous work has largely focused on the benchmark scenario where the dark sector mirrors ordinary matter, with $m_{e_{D}}$ near the electron mass, $m_{p_{D}}$ near the proton mass, and $α_{D}\\sim 1/137$. We extend this analysis by investigating dark recombination and cooling physics across the full parameter space of masses and couplings.

However, no such birefringent material can be used for the far-UV (FUV) channel [100-123 nm]. Therefore, the polarimeter for this FUV channel is composed solely of mirrors in an innovative assembly. In this talk, we aim to detail the architecture of the test bench that will allow us to validate the performance of these different polarimeters, as part of the HWO GOMaP. Given that we are working in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) range, the test bench operates in a vacuum chamber in a clean room. We will discuss the adaptable architecture of the bench based on wavelength and the measurement methodology that we will implement to test if the polarimeters achieve the precision of $10^{-3}$ required for the Pollux instrument.

However, the spectra of metal-poor stars can be difficult to analyse because of the relative lack of available lines, which can also lead to misclassification. We aim to identify the stars observed by the APOGEE survey that are below the metallicity limit of APOGEE's analysis. For the highest confidence candidates, we classify the orbital properties of the stars to investigate whether their orbital distribution matches what we would expect for stars that are this metal poor and to select especially interesting targets for spectroscopic follow-up purposes. We examined the properties derived by APOGEE for metal-poor stars from the literature to find signatures of stars with a metallicity below the range of the grid used for spectral analysis. The calibrated APOGEE stellar parameters provide a clear signature of the most metal-poor stars in the survey, indicated by null values for their metallicities while having effective temperatures and surface gravities determined by the pipeline. From comparison with the literature, we find that, within a temperature range of 3700 - 6700 K and above a threshold of S/N > 30, the vast majority of APOGEE stars without calibrated metallicities are very metal poor. The radial velocities provided by APOGEE, Gaia DR3 positions and astrometry along with spectrophotometric distances derived in this work allowed for the computation of their orbits. In this work, we select 289 very metal-poor red giant stars (likely below = -2.5) from the APOGEE results. Our sample contains 16 very metal-poor member candidates of the Magellanic Clouds, 14 very metal-poor stars with orbits confined to the inner Galaxy, and 13 inner Galaxy halo interlopers."}

We derive constraints on the scalar self-interaction coupling $λ_s$, the mass $m_s$, and coefficients of quantum gravity-induced operators. We find that the constraints depend sensitively on the reheating dynamics. Our analysis demonstrates that universal gravity effects do not necessarily spoil the predictivity of non-thermal dark matter scenarios with $k < 4$ and low reheating temperatures, as an extended reheating phase dilutes gravitationally-produced relics. For $k > 4$, on the other hand, the relic abundance is enhanced during the reheating phase, leading to stringent constraints on the scalar.

The first paper in this series successfully identified a sample of 327 very metal-poor stars (with [Fe/H] < -2) from the APOGEE database, 289 of which are on the red giant branch. The spectra of these stars were not properly analysed by the APOGEE main pipeline because they are very metal poor. In this work, we measure metallicities for these stars using the abundances of the elements Mg and Si. We demonstrate that the absorption lines of the elements Mg and Si are of good quality despite the challenging combination of (low) metallicity, wavelength regime, spectral resolution, and signal-to-noise ratios available for these spectra. A specialised pipeline was designed to measure the abundance of Mg and Si in APOGEE spectra and yielded a robust estimate of the overall metallicity. In order to provide reliable measurements, we tested three different sets of assumptions for Mg and Si enhancement. We present Mg and Si abundances as well as overall metallicities for 327 stars, all of which had previously gotten null values from the main APOGEE pipeline for either the calibrated M/H or [Fe/H] . The typical uncertainties for our measurements are 0.2 dex. We found five stars in our sample with unusual [Si/Mg] abundances higher than 0.5, and we connect this signature to globular cluster stars, and this might be related to specific supernova events. Our data suggest a concentration of high [Si/Mg] stars in the Sextans dwarf galaxy. Other dwarf galaxies are found to agree well with results in the literature. Our derived metallicities range between -3.1 $\\leq$ [M/H] $\\leq$ -2.25, thereby pushing the metal-poor tail of APOGEE results down by 0.6 dex."}

Successive collisions and mergers of massive stars could also lead to the formation of massive black holes, serving as seeds for supermassive black hole in the early universe. While analytic fitting formulae exist for predicting collision outcomes, they do not generalize across different energy scales or stellar evolutionary phases. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations are often used to compute the outcomes of stellar collisions, but, even at low resolution, their computational cost makes running on-the-fly calculations during an $N$-body simulation quite challenging. Here we present a new grid of $27,720$ SPH calculations of main-sequence star collisions, spanning a wide range of masses, ages, relative velocities, and impact parameters. Using this grid, we train machine learning models to predict both collision outcomes (merger vs disruption, or flyby) and final remnant masses. We compare the performance of nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks, achieving classification balanced accuracy of $98.4\\%$, and regression relative errors as low as $0.11\\%$ and $0.15\\%$ for the final stars $1$ and $2$, respectively.

Performance is assessed via RMSE, conservation of flux and spectra, noise reduction, and SNR improvement of the central galaxy. For synthetic cubes: PCA and ICA provide marginal improvement; IST reduces noise effectively at moderate SNRs but can suppress emission at low SNRs; and the U-Net outperforms IST, though it can produce quantifiable hallucinations at lower-SNRs. For moderate-SNR observations (ALMA-CRISTAL), U-Net and IST achieve comparable performance, conserving >91% flux and increasing SNR by >6. However, for observations with complex morphologies absent in the training set (W2246), the U-Net underperforms relative to IST, recovering ~80% flux, while IST robustly conserves flux and improves SNR by ~3, highlighting generalisation challenges and the need for physically-motivated training priors. We conclude that IST is a robust unsupervised denoiser for moderate-SNR data, and a synthetically trained U-Net generalises effectively to real data, dependent on training priors.

Aims: We present a fast, unsupervised methodology to reduce stellar contamination and instrument-specific noise in exoplanet transmission spectra using denoising autoencoders, improving the reliability of retrieved atmospheric parameters. Methods: We design and train denoising autoencoder architectures on large synthetic datasets of terrestrial (TRAPPIST-1e analogues) and sub-Neptune (K2-18b analogues) planets. Reconstruction quality is evaluated with the $χ^2$ statistic over a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, and atmospheric retrieval experiments on contaminated spectra are used to compare against standard correction approaches in accuracy and computational cost. Results: The autoencoders reconstruct uncontaminated spectra while preserving key molecular features, even at low S/N. In retrieval tests, pre-processing with denoising autoencoders reduces bias in inferred abundances relative to uncorrected baselines and matches the accuracy of simultaneous stellar-contamination fitting while reducing computational time by a factor of three to six.

Here we measure the deflector scale (Einstein mass) and deflector environment (halo mass) of 89 spectroscopically confirmed strong lenses in the ASTRO3D Galaxy Evolution With Lenses (AGEL) survey. We classify deflector scale by measuring $θ_{\\rm{E}}$ to determine the mass enclosed by the Einstein radius, $M(<θ_{\\rm{E}})$. We quantify deflector environment by using photometric redshifts to determine the galaxy surface density to the fifth-nearest neighbor $Σ_5(z)$. We find that 47.2% of our deflectors are embedded in cluster environments, whereas only 9.0% have cluster-scale Einstein radii (masses). We measure a weak correlation ($r = 0.38$) between Einstein mass and $Σ_5(z)$, suggesting that the assumption of single galaxy-scale deflectors in lens modeling is overly-simplified. We hypothesize that the weak correlation results from galaxy-scale bias in the original AGEL selection and the observational challenge of detecting faint arcs with large Einstein radii. Comparing number densities, $N_{\\rm{gal}}$, between AGEL and control fields, we find that AGEL deflectors are in systematically denser environments.

The black hole was either dynamically ejected from the nucleus or lies at the center of a very faint tidally-stripped dwarf galaxy undergoing a minor merger. Late-time observations of TDE 2025abcr could confirm the origin of this apparent 'orphan' black hole. The rate of highly offset ($\\gtrsim$3 kpc) TDEs can be constrained to $<$10% of the nuclear TDE rate, but our discovery implies that many dozens of similar sources will be detected by the Vera C. Rubin each year with resolvable offsets."}

This is most relevant in the design of spacecraft, where radiation pressure presents the dominant non-conservative forcing mechanism, which is the case beyond approximately 800 km altitude. Despite its importance, the high computational cost of high-fidelity radiation pressure modeling has limited its use in large-scale spacecraft design, optimization, and space situational awareness applications. We enable this by offering three innovations in the simulation, in representation and in optimization: First, a practical computer graphics-inspired Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation of radiation pressure. The simulation is highly parallel, uses importance sampling and next-event estimation to reduce variance and allows simulating an entire family of designs instead of a single spacecraft as in previous work. Second, we introduce neural networks as a representation of forces from design parameters. This neural proxy model, learned from simulations, is inherently differentiable and can query forces orders of magnitude faster than a full MC simulation. Third, and finally, we demonstrate optimizing inverse radiation pressure designs, such as finding geometry, material or operation parameters that minimizes travel time, maximizes proximity given a desired end-point, minimize thruster fuel, trains mission control policies or allocated compute budget in extraterrestrial compute."}

It is not only the direct result of the star formation process but it also explains the evolution of galaxies' luminosities, metal yields, star-formation efficiencies, and supernova production rates. Because most stars exist in binary systems, however, a full statistical account of stellar mass requires not the IMF but rather the joint distribution of a binary population's primary- and secondary-star masses. This joint distribution must respect the IMF of the stars from which the population has been assembled as well as the distribution of mass ratios that results from the assembly mechanism. Despite its importance, this joint distribution is known only in the case of random pairing. Here we present a method for constructing it in the general case. We also illustrate the use of our method by recovering the known result for random pairing and by finding the previously unknown result for uniform pairing."}

We evaluate and benchmark denoising strategies including Principal Component Analysis, Independent Component Analysis, sparse unsupervised representations: iterative soft thresholding with 2D-1D wavelets, and supervised deep learning with a 3D U-Net, to identify techniques that suppress noise while preserving flux and morphology across peak SNRs of 2.5-8, applied to (i) synthetic spectral cubes of rotating toy disk galaxies, (ii) synthetic [C II] IFU cubes from FIRE simulations, and (iii) ALMA [C II] observations of CRISTAL galaxies and W2246-0526. Performance is assessed via RMSE, conservation of flux and spectra, noise reduction, and SNR improvement of the central galaxy. For synthetic cubes: PCA and ICA provide marginal improvement; IST reduces noise effectively at moderate SNRs but can suppress emission at low SNRs; and the U-Net outperforms IST, though it can produce quantifiable hallucinations at lower-SNRs. For moderate-SNR observations (ALMA-CRISTAL), U-Net and IST achieve comparable performance, conserving >91% flux and increasing SNR by >6. However, for observations with complex morphologies absent in the training set (W2246), the U-Net underperforms relative to IST, recovering ~80% flux, while IST robustly conserves flux and improves SNR by ~3, highlighting generalisation challenges and the need for physically-motivated training priors. We conclude that IST is a robust unsupervised denoiser for moderate-SNR data, and a synthetically trained U-Net generalises effectively to real data, dependent on training priors.

Successive collisions and mergers of massive stars could also lead to the formation of massive black holes, serving as seeds for supermassive black hole in the early universe. While analytic fitting formulae exist for predicting collision outcomes, they do not generalize across different energy scales or stellar evolutionary phases. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations are often used to compute the outcomes of stellar collisions, but, even at low resolution, their computational cost makes running on-the-fly calculations during an $N$-body simulation quite challenging. Here we present a new grid of $27,720$ SPH calculations of main-sequence star collisions, spanning a wide range of masses, ages, relative velocities, and impact parameters. Using this grid, we train machine learning models to predict both collision outcomes (merger vs disruption, or flyby) and final remnant masses.

Deep learning methods leverage pixel-level information from ground-based images to achieve the best photo-$z$'s for low-redshift galaxies, but their efficacy at higher redshifts with deep, space-based imaging remains largely untested. We used Hubble Space Telescope CANDELS optical and near-infrared imaging to evaluate fully-supervised, self-supervised, and semi-supervised deep learning photo-$z$ algorithms out to $z\\sim3$. Compared to template-based and classical machine learning photometry methods, the fully-supervised and semi-supervised models achieved better performance. Our new semi-supervised model, PITA (Photo-$z$ Inference with a Triple-loss Algorithm), outperformed all others by learning from unlabeled and labeled data through a three-part loss function that incorporates images and colors for all objects as well as redshifts when available. PITA produces a latent space that varies smoothly in magnitude, color, and redshift, resulting in the best photo-$z$ performance even when the redshift training set was significantly reduced. In contrast, the self-supervised approach produced a latent space with significant color and redshift fluctuations that hindered photo-$z$ inference. Looking forward to Roman, we recommend using semi supervised deep learning to take full advantage of the information contained in the hundreds of millions of high-resolution images and color measurements, together with the limited redshift measurements available, to achieve the most accurate photo-$z$ estimates for both faint and bright sources."}

We use a set of muon neutrinos with interaction vertices inside the detector, which have good sensitivity to sources in the Southern sky, from IceCube data recorded between 2011 and 2021. We then search for individual and collective neutrino signals from 14 Seyfert galaxies in the Southern Sky selected from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) AGN Spectroscopic Survey. Using the correlations between keV X-rays and TeV neutrinos predicted by disk-corona models, and assuming production characteristics similar to NGC~1068, a collective neutrino signal search reveals an excess of $6.7_{-3.2}^{+4.0}$ events, which is inconsistent with background expectations at the 3$σ$ level of significance.

To such a level, some new accelerations make their appearance. They are proportional to even and odd powers of the hole's angular momentum. Their counterparts are not known where the primary is a material body. After expressing them in a coordinate-independent, vector form valid for any orientations of the hole's spin axis in space, their orbital effects are perturbatively worked out in terms of the particle's Keplerian orbital elements. The resulting expressions, averaged over one orbital revolution, are valid for generic shapes and inclinations of the orbit. The orbital plane's precession proportional to the first power of the hole's angular momentum and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light amounts to about twenty per cent of the corresponding Lense-Thirring effect. The latter is believed to be the cause of the accurately measured disk/jet precessional phenomenology, currently measured to a few per cent accuracy. Although at a lesser extent, also the precession proportional to the second power of the hole's spin and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light is measurable.

Aims: We revisit the stellar census in the CMa region, characterizing its stellar population, kinematics, and age using recent astrometric and photometric data from the third data release of the Gaia space mission (Gaia DR3). Methods: We conducted a membership analysis of Gaia DR3 sources across a 16 deg$^2$ field encompassing the youngest subgroups in CMa. This new stellar census, combined with spectroscopic observations, allowed us to investigate the structure, kinematics, and age of this region. Results: We identified 1531 objects as members of the CMa region, confirming 401 previously known members and introducing 1130 new candidate members. These objects have magnitudes ranging from 10 to 18 mag in the G band from Gaia DR3. We identified two subgroups of CMa stars in our sample labelled as Cluster A and Cluster B. They are located at roughly the same distance ($d_{A} = 1150^{+79}_{-88}$ pc and $d_{B} = 1183^{+103}_{-108}$ pc) and exhibit similar space motions that can be derived thanks to the precise radial velocities obtained in this study. The subgroups have a mean isochronal age of about 2-3 Myr. However, based on infrared photometry we show that Cluster A has a higher fraction of disc-bearing stars suggesting that it could be somewhat younger than Cluster B. Conclusions: Our analysis provides new insights into the stellar population of the Canis Major region, by identifying new members, characterizing their kinematics, and assessing their evolutionary stages. Future studies incorporating additional data from upcoming Gaia data releases, multi-wavelength and high-resolution spectroscopic observations will be essential to further advance our understanding of the history of star formation in this region."}

Combining such signals with high resolution HI emission maps offers a unique opportunity to probe the dynamics of neutral gas at cosmological distances through constraints of the HI excitation temperature $T_{spin}$, which characterises the balance of neutral gas phases and the underlying thermal processes within these galactic environments. While no absorption signal has been recorded in an FRB to date, we demonstrate a proof of concept with the bright (F = 35 Jy ms) and narrow (0.2 ms) FRB 20211127I detected by ASKAP. We find a 3$σ$ upper limit on the integrated optical depth in the pulse-averaged spectrum of 33 km s$^{-1}$, and, based on the HI emission observed in a 3 hr MeerKAT L-band observation, subsequently find a lower limit on $T_{spin}$ of 26 K. While this test case provides little constraining power, we find that narrow, non-repeating FRBs with fluences greater than 20/70/150 Jy ms observed with all dishes with the current MeerKAT/ASKAP/DSA telescopes can probe integrated optical depths below 5 km s$^{-1}$. Furthermore, we highlight that utilising FAST's incredible sensitivity to stack thousands of bursts from hyperactive repeaters also provides a plausible avenue through which HI absorption, and hence $T_{spin}$, can be measured. Finally, we discuss how HI absorption can address several modern challenges in FRB science, providing a physical anchor for locating bursts within their host galaxies and helping to disentangle the host contribution to dispersion and scattering."}

However, a critical understanding gap remains between the microscopic generation of these seeds and the macroscopic onset of the dynamo. Current kinetic models, often constrained to electron scales, predict premature saturation via magnetic trapping, leaving the generated fields potentially too weak and small-scale to effectively prime magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes. Here, using high-resolution kinetic simulations with a realistic mass ratio, we reveal the physics of this unexplored ion-kinetic regime. Under generalized continuous shear driving, used to simulate ubiquitous macroscopic flows, we demonstrate that the saturation of electron instabilities is not the endpoint but a precursor to a distinct, ion-dominated evolution. Massive ions, sustaining the velocity shear, trigger a subsequent filamentation instability that accesses the vast ion kinetic energy reservoir. This mechanism amplifies the magnetic energy by orders of magnitude beyond the electron-saturation limit, expanding the field coherence to ion scales. Our results establish ion kinetics as the essential ''missing link'' that bridges the divide between microscopic plasma instabilities and macroscopic cosmic dynamos."}

While recent computational studies increasingly report full distributions of BEs rather than single representative values, these distributions are typically derived for either bare grain surfaces or thick water-ice mantles. In this work, we bridge these regimes by systematically investigating the BE distributions of water on partially and fully ice-covered dust grain surfaces.\n  We employ machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) based on graph neural networks to model water adsorption on graphene and on the Mg-terminated (010) surface of forsterite, representing carbonaceous and silicate grains, respectively. The models enable extensive sampling of adsorption sites on water clusters, monolayers, and bilayers generated under both crystalline (thermally processed) and amorphous (low-temperature) growth conditions. At submonolayer coverage, the chemical nature of the underlying grain strongly affects both ice morphology and binding energies, with Mg-O interactions on silicate surfaces producing particularly deep binding sites. From monolayer coverage onward, adsorption on both substrates is dominated by hydrogen bonding within the ice, reducing the influence of the grain material.\n  Across all coverages, amorphous ice structures systematically shift the BE distributions toward stronger binding compared to crystalline ice, introducing highly stable defect and pocket sites. These results demonstrate that BE distributions in the submonolayer to few-layer ice regime are broad and highly surface dependent, and they provide physically motivated input for next-generation astrochemical models incorporating surface heterogeneity."}
