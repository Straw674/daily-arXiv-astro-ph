However, our knowledge about the process on how multiple stellar systems form is incomplete and biased toward nearby molecular clouds forming only low-mass stars, which are unrepresentative of the stellar population in the Galaxy. Most stars form within dense cores in clusters alongside high-mass stars (>8 M$_{\\odot}$), as likely the Sun did. Here we report deep ALMA 1.33 mm dust continuum observations at ~160 au spatial resolution, revealing 72 low-mass multiple systems embedded in 23 high-mass cluster-forming regions, as part of the Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA) survey. We find that the companion separation distribution presents a distinct peak at ~1200 au, in contrast to the one at ~4000 au observed in nearby low-mass regions. The shorter fragmentation scale can be explained by considering the higher pressure exerted by the surrounding medium, which is higher than the one in low-mass regions, due to the larger turbulence and densities involved. Because the peak of the companion separation distribution occurs at much larger scales than the expected disk sizes, we argue that the observed fragmentation is produced by turbulent core fragmentation. Contrary as predicted, the multiplicity fraction remains constant as the stellar density increases.

In this work, we investigate the resolved stellar population and emission-line properties of 51 miniJPAS galaxies, classified by spectral type (red or blue) and environment (group or field), and assess the role of environment in galaxy evolution. We use the Py2DJPAS pipeline to process the data, homogenise the images to a common PSF, define galactic regions, and extract photo-spectra.

Red and blue galaxies are well separated in these relations, whereas environmental classification shows no clear distinction.

Traditional continuum reverberation mapping uses short lags between variability in different wavelength AGN light curves on the light crossing timescale of the disk to measure the radial structure of the disk. The harder-to-detect long negative lag measures lags on the longer inflow timescale, opening up a new window to mapping out the vertical structure of AGN disks. The Vera Rubin Observatory, with its 6 wavebands, long baseline, and high cadence, will revolutionize our ability to detect short and long lags. However, many challenges remain to detect these long lags, such as seasonal gaps in Rubin light curves, the weak signal strength of the long lag relative to the short lag, and the enormous influx of data for millions of AGN from Rubin. Machine learning techniques have the potential to solve many of these issues, but have yet to be applied to the long negative lag problem. We develop and train a transformer-based machine learning model to detect long and short lags in mock Rubin AGN light curves. Our model identifies whether a light curve in our test set has a long negative lag with 96% recall and 0.04% contamination, and is 98% accurate at predicting the true long lag.

The combined gravitational effects of these components, along with relativistic corrections from the BH's spin, generate strongly nonlinear dynamics and frequent chaotic orbital behaviour. To model this environment, we employ a multipolar expansion potential in which the central compact object is represented by the Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov pseudo-Newtonian potential, effectively capturing spin-dependent features of a Kerr-like BH. The surrounding halo is treated as an axisymmetric, shell-like mass distribution expanded up to third order in multipolar terms to account for realistic asymmetry. Previous studies have mainly explored the influence of multipolar moments and BH spin using Poincare sections, SALI, and related chaos indicators. In this work, we extend these analyses by incorporating stability analysis and basins of convergence to achieve a more complete understanding of the system's dynamics. Stability analysis around equilibrium points provides insight into local behavior, while basins of convergence highlight sensitivity to initial conditions and expose fractal basin boundaries. Our results show that the BH spin significantly reshapes phase space: depending on its magnitude and orientation, it can either amplify chaotic scattering caused by halo asymmetry or stabilize specific orbital families.

At the same time, these observations challenge the validity of such classical methods when applied to the extreme environments typical at high redshift. We present an in-depth analysis of the ISM in three representative case studies at $z=2 - 6$ (MARTA 4327, the Sunburst Arc and RXCJ2248-ID) conducted within a multi-cloud photoionisation modelling framework (HOMERUN). We show that even a small fraction of unresolved high-density clumps can contribute more than half of the observed flux of auroral lines, while only negligibly to standard optical density tracers. As a result, $T_{\\mathrm{e}}$-method metallicities can be underestimated by $\\sim 0.15 - 0.3$ dex, as for MARTA 4327. By modelling rest-frame UV and optical data, we demonstrate that discrepancies between abundances obtained from diagnostics tracing different zones do not necessarily imply chemical inhomogeneities. In RXCJ2248-ID, the disagreement between UV and optical N/O may naturally arise from ionisation and density structure alone. In contrast, we find evidence for genuine chemical stratification in the Sunburst Arc, where a component enriched in nitrogen coexists with a chemically normal one. Finally, we argue that very-high-ionisation lines may be explained within a pure star-formation scenario invoking matter-bounded regions. However, in the case of RXCJ2248-ID, we cannot rule out a minor contribution from an AGN based solely on the observed fluxes.

The electron pressure profile is a convenient tool to characterize the thermodynamical state of a galaxy cluster, with several studies adopting a \"universal\" functional form.\n  Aims. This study aims at using Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) data to test four different functional forms for the cluster pressure profile: generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW), $β$-model, polytropic, and exponential. The goal is to assess to what level they are universal over a population-level cluster sample.\n  Methods. A set of 3496 ACT-DR4 galaxy clusters, spanning the mass range $[10^{14},10^{15.1}]\\,\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ and the redshift range $[0,2]$, is stacked on the ACT-DR6 Compton parameter $y$ map over $\\sim13,000\\,\\text{deg}^2$. An angular Compton profile is then extracted and modeled using the theoretical pressure recipes, whose free parameters are constrained against the measurement via a multi-stage MCMC approach. The analysis is repeated over cluster subsamples spanning smaller mass and redshift ranges.\n  Results. All functional forms are effective in reproducing the measured $y$ profiles within their error bars, without a clearly favored model. While best-fit estimates are in broad agreement with previous findings, hints of residual subsample dependency are detected favoring higher amplitudes and steeper profiles in high-mass, low-redshift clusters.\n  Conclusions. Population-level cluster studies based on SZ data alone are likely unable to accurately constrain different pressure profile models.

X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeating, high-amplitude, soft X-ray bursts observed from the nuclei of a dozen nearby low-mass galaxies.

This rise is probed to be intrinsic to the central engine, confirming the already detected extended emission line region (EELR) by integral field unit data. Conclusions. The increasing radial polarization demonstrates a switched-off nucleus. The polarization angle traces an axis aligned with elongated [OIII], [NII], and Hα gas distributions, revealing an EELR that may be consistent with relic polarization cones, therefore suggesting the presence of a torus-like structure in the past. Thus, optical polarization echoes geometrically favor a faded AGN as the origin of the EELR rather than a past elevated TDE rate, although the latter cannot be excluded.", "AI": {"tldr": "通过光学偏振测量发现GSN 069的径向递增偏振模式及其与延伸发射线区(EELR)的几何关联，支持其过去活动源于褪色活动星系核(AGN)而非潮汐瓦解事件(TDE)率升高。", "background": "X射线准周期性喷发(QPEs)是观测自邻近低质量星系核区的重复性、高振幅软X射线爆发，其起源仍是吸积变率物理学的未解之谜。", "data": "数据来源于2019年9月6日使用VLT（甚大望远镜）的FORS2（焦面减光和低色散光谱仪）设备对GSN 069进行的成像偏振测量和光谱偏振测量观测。", "method": "采用光学偏振测量（imaging polarimetry）和光谱偏振测量（spectropolarimetry）技术分析GSN 069的偏振特性。", "result": "径向偏振的增加证实了GSN 069存在已关闭的活动星系核（AGN），其偏振角度与延伸的[OIII]、[NII]和Hα气体分布轴对齐，表明过去存在类似环面（torus-like）的结构。"}}

We evaluate the accurate expression for the small-scale power responsible for the collapse of the first halos in the presence of the PBH population. The extra power in the matter density field, produced by the granulation term, will cause an earlier collapse of DM halos, populated by PBHs of different masses. In these collapsed and virialized systems the PBHs will undergo 2-body relaxation, driving the more massive PBHs to the halo center under dynamical friction. We quantify this evolution for a distribution of PBH orbital parameters and halo properties.

In contrast, when using physical gas clumps, the duality disappears and all galaxies show a single trend. We also study other ISM/clump properties as a function of the merger stage. We find that isolated galaxies and systems in early stages of interaction exhibit lower amounts of gas and SF.

Using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we simulate the SMBH accreting stellar winds from approximately 1500 asymptotic giant branch stars, and explore the role of ram pressure from the ambient interstellar or intracluster medium.

We investigate how lens mass-profile assumptions affect time delays. Specifically, we implement a Broken Power Law (BPL) mass model within the Lenstronomy framework (Birrer & Amara 2018), which introduces additional flexibility in the radial mass distribution and can phenomenologically capture deviations from a single power-law profile. This model is combined with a numerical approach to compute time delays at the image positions. We validate the BPL implementation using simulated lenses and compare the results with those obtained from the elliptical power-law (EPL) model. We then apply both model families to the quadruply imaged quasar WGD~2038-4008. Both models fit the imaging and kinematic data comparably well, yet the greater radial freedom in the BPL model shifts the inferred time-delay distance -- and thus $H_0$ -- by an amount comparable to the current discrepancy between early- and late-universe $H_0$ estimates. In a flat $Λ$CDM cosmology, the $H_0$ inferred using the BPL lens model is $75^{+23.1}_{-16.3} \\ \\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1} \\ Mpc^{-1}},$ while the EPL model gives $H_0 = 61^{+19.2}_{-13.2} \\ \\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1} \\ Mpc^{-1}}.$ This difference is largely due to uncertainties in the inner mass profile ($θ<0.2''$), a region where point spread function (PSF) reconstruction is a critical factor -- a finding consistent with results reported in Shajib et al.

For each galaxy, we identify regions with suppressed specific star formation rate (sSFR) and measure $Δf_{gas}$ and $Δ$SFE-offsets from the resolved scaling relations of the star-forming main sequence galaxies.

Using numerical simulations, we show that the evolution of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos is governed by the interplay between internal stellar relaxation and ULDM-induced heating. We find the following main results. First, in sufficiently compact systems, relaxation-driven core collapse dominates, allowing the system to remain bound and dense, while ULDM-induced stripping of outer stars further accelerates the collapse.

This UV field is a major agent of ionization and dissociation in the inner regions of molecular clouds that are shielded from the effects of the interstellar radiation field. In particular, the dissociation of $\\rm H_2$, by far the most abundant molecule in interstellar clouds, leads to the production of atomic hydrogen which then takes part in the production of a multitude of molecules, in particular complex organics on the surfaces of interstellar dust grains. Precise knowledge of the rates of CR-induced dissociation processes is thus crucial for constructing reliable chemical models. For the present paper, we have derived a new value of $k_{\\rm diss, CR}(\\mbox{$\\rm H_2$})=0.831ζ$ for the rate of $\\rm H_2$ dissociation, where $ζ$ is the CR ionization rate of $\\rm H_2$. This prediction contrasts a previous value from the Leiden database which overestimated the rate due to an inconsistent treatment of the $\\rm H_2$ abundances and photodissociation cross sections. By running a series of chemical models, we show that the overestimated dissociation rate has a large effect on the results of chemical simulations, with the abundance of methanol being overestimated by over one order of magnitude.

We show that this degeneracy can be broken by combining FRBs with other emerging probes whose degeneracy directions differ in the $H_0$-$Ω_{\\rm b}$ plane. Specifically, we quantify three multi-messenger approaches: FRBs paired with gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens, strong gravitational lensing (SGL) time delays, and 21 cm intensity mapping (IM).

This discrepancy could be explained if the optical depth $τ$ inferred from the CMB large-scale E-mode polarization is underestimated, which may be biased by foreground-subtraction or instrumental systematics. In this work, we present a determination of $τ$ independent of the large-scale E-mode polarization, using the latest measurements of the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction $x_\\mathrm{HI}(z)$, which is constrained by Lyman-$α$ forest and damping-wing absorption measurements at $z\\sim5$-$14$, based on ground-based optical and JWST observations. Combining $x_\\mathrm{HI}(z)$ with the Planck CMB power spectra excluding the large-scale E-mode polarization, we obtain $τ=0.0552^{+0.0019}_{-0.0026}$, a stringent constraint consistent with the previous CMB results including the large-scale E-mode. We also evaluate a potential systematic error in our method associated with absorption modeling, obtaining $τ=0.0552^{+0.0075}_{-0.0049}$. Using this constraint on $τ$, we resolve the degeneracy in the $τ$-$Ω_m$ plane and find a $2.4σ$ tension with the DESI DR2 BAO results, thereby confirming the claimed mild discrepancy suggestive of physics beyond $Λ$CDM.

A firm identification of the source of the NG15 signal requires an accurate reconstruction of its frequency spectrum. In this paper, we provide such a spectral characterization of the NG15 signal based on a piecewise power-law (PPL) ansatz that strikes a balance between existing alternatives in the literature. Our PPL reconstruction is more flexible than the standard constant-power-law model, which describes the GWB spectrum in terms of only two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index gamma. Concurrently, it better approximates physically realistic GWB spectra -- especially those of cosmological origin -- than the free spectral model, since the latter allows for arbitrary variations in the GWB amplitude from one frequency bin to the next.

For B335, an 8-month gap between NIRSpec and MIRI MRS observations enabled measurement of the tangential velocity of a shocked knot; in combination with the radial velocity, this shows that the jet has a different inclination than the outflow cavity. We find multiple knots before and during a recent outburst in B335, although the knots were more frequent during the burst. The asymmetries between blue- and red-shifted lobes strongly suggest complex interactions between the circumstellar disks and magnetic fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "利用JWST观测发现三颗深埋原恒星（B335、HOPS 153、HOPS 370）在2000天文单位内的喷流形态和运动学特征，其中[Fe II]发射线可追踪喷流内部1000-2000天文单位范围，喷流呈现摆动、非单调增宽（2.1°-<10.1°）及红蓝移瓣不对称性，表明 circumstellar disks（原行星盘）与磁场存在复杂相互作用。", "background": "研究聚焦于利用JWST（James Webb Space Telescope）观测三颗深埋原恒星（protostars）2000天文单位（au）范围内的喷流（jets），揭示其形态、运动学特征及与周围环境的相互作用。", "data": "数据来源于JWST（James Webb Space Telescope）的NIRSpec和MIRI IFUs对三个原恒星（B335、HOPS 153和HOPS 370）在2.9-27微米波段的观测，捕获了激波电离的精细结构线发射。", "method": "采用JWST（James Webb Space Telescope）的近红外光谱仪（NIRSpec）和中红外成像光谱仪（MIRI IFUs）观测激波电离的精细结构线发射，分析[Fe II]等离子的空间分布和运动学特征。", "result": "[Fe II]发射能追踪原恒星1000至2000天文单位范围内的喷流整体结构，而其他离子主要标记孤立激波结；喷流存在平面摆动运动及红蓝移瓣不对称性，宽度随距离非单调增加，张开角介于2.1度至小于10.1度之间，校正盘倾角后总速度范围为147至184公里/秒；B335喷流倾角与流出腔不同，爆发期间激波结出现更频繁；红蓝移瓣不对称性强烈暗示星周盘与磁场的复杂相互作用。"}}
