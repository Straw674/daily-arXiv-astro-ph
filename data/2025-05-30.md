### [1] [Variability in the massive black hole binary candidate SDSS J2320+0024: no evidence for periodic modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22706)
*Fabio Rigamonti,Lorenzo Bertassi,Riccardo Buscicchio,Fabiola Cocchiararo,Stefano Covino,Massimo Dotti,Alberto Sesana,Paola Severgnini*

**TL;DR**: The study re-analyzes the optical light-curves of SDSS J2320+0024, a candidate massive black hole binary, finding no significant evidence for periodicity over red noise variability, challenging previous claims but not ruling out the binary interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) are expected to be prominent gravitational wave sources, and SDSS J2320+0024 was proposed as a candidate due to potential periodicity in its light-curve and variability in the MgII emission line.

Data: Optical light-curves in the g and r bands of SDSS J2320+0024.

Method: Bayesian model selection was used to analyze the light-curves, testing periodic models with and without red noise.

Result: No significant evidence for a true periodic signal over red noise variability was found, questioning the robustness of previous claims of periodicity.

Abstract: Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) are a natural outcome of galaxy mergers,
and they are expected to be among the loudest gravitational wave sources at low
frequencies. SDSS J2320+0024 has been recently proposed as a promising MBHB
candidate due to a possible periodicity in its light-curve and variability in
the MgII emission line. In this work, we re-analyse the optical (g and r bands)
light-curves of J2320+0024 within the framework of Bayesian model selection.
When a periodicity is searched for together with red noise, the analysis of the
g-band light-curve finds a peak in the posterior of the period at ~290 days.
The posterior profile is too broad to result in a preference for the periodic
models with respect to models including only red-noise. Furthermore, the same
peak is not present in the analysis of the r-band light-curve. A periodic model
without red-noise identifies a different (~1100 days) periodicity, and it is
significantly statistically disfavoured with respect to the other tested
models. In summary, no significant evidence in favour of a true periodic signal
over red noise variability is found. Our analysis questions the robustness of
the previously claimed periodicity and emphasizes the importance of rigorous
statistical treatment. While our findings challenge the binary interpretation
for J2320+0024, they do not rule it out. A statistically robust joint analysis
of the photometric light-curves and of the evolving broad line profiles can
shed further light on the real nature of this object.

### [2] [Explaining the Weak Evolution of the High-Redshift Mass-Metallicity Relation with Galaxy Burst Cycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22712)
*Andrew Marszewski,Claude-André Faucher-Giguère,Robert Feldmann,Guochao Sun*

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过分析FIRE-2宇宙学模拟，揭示了高红移星系质量-金属丰度关系（MZR）稳定的物理机制，并提出“减少爆发模型”解释其演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 观测显示，红移大于5时星系的气相质量-金属丰度关系（MZR）几乎不变，这与红移小于3时的观测结果形成对比。现有研究认为弱演化或饱和的气体分数是主要原因，但FIRE-2模拟表明这不足以解释其演化。

Data: 使用了FIRE-2宇宙学高红移模拟数据。

Method: 通过分析FIRE-2模拟数据，提出“减少爆发模型”（Reduced Burst Model），并验证其对MZR演化的解释能力。

Result: 研究发现，恒星反馈驱动的气体外流和爆发周期是MZR稳定的关键因素，同时模拟结果与基本金属丰度关系（FMR）定性一致。

Abstract: Recent observations suggest a nearly constant gas-phase mass-metallicity
relation (MZR) at $z \gtrsim 5$, in agreement with many theoretical
predictions. This lack of evolution contrasts with observations at $z \lesssim
3$, which find an increasing normalization of the MZR with decreasing redshift.
We analyze a high-redshift suite of FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations to
identify the physical drivers of the MZR. Previous studies have explained the
weak evolution of the high-redshift MZR in terms of weakly evolving or
saturated gas fractions, but we find this alone does not explain the evolution
in FIRE-2. Instead, stellar feedback following intense bursts of star formation
drives enriched gas out of galaxies, resetting their interstellar medium and
separating their histories into distinct ``burst cycles". We develop the
``Reduced Burst Model", a simplified gas-regulator model that successfully
reproduces the simulated MZR and identifies the dominant drivers of its
evolution. As redshift decreases, the metallicity of inflows within burst
cycles increases at fixed stellar mass due to increased wind recycling of
enriched gas. Meanwhile, the metal mass produced by stars per inflowing gas
mass within these cycles decreases because of decreased star formation per gas
mass inflowing into the galaxy. The effects of these two processes on the
median metallicity largely cancel, holding the MZR constant for $z = 5 - 12$.
At fixed stellar mass, the simulations predict lower gas metallicities at
higher $\rm H\alpha$-derived star formation rates, in qualitative agreement
with the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR), but this effect is reduced in
rest UV-selected samples.

### [3] [Stellar Mass Segregation in Dark Matter Halos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22717)
*Raphaël Errani,Jorge Peñarrubia,Matthew G. Walker*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过碰撞弛豫驱动的恒星质量分层效应在平滑暗物质晕中的表现，发现质量分层会影响低质量恒星的径向分布，并增加暗物质主导的矮星系中心区域大质量双星的丰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究背景聚焦于碰撞弛豫驱动的恒星质量分层效应在平滑暗物质晕中的作用，特别关注了具有短穿越时间的古老恒星系统。

Data: 研究使用了Ursa Major 3/Unions 1、Delve 1和Eridanus 3等模糊恒星系统的数据，将其恒星群体建模为高、低质量恒星的两组分系统。

Method: 研究采用了碰撞N体模拟方法，针对特定恒星系统进行了10 Gyr的演化模拟。

Result: 研究发现，低质量恒星的径向范围在高、低质量恒星之间表现出显著差异，质量分层在强潮汐场中促进低质量恒星的剥离，并增加中心区域大质量双星的形成。

Abstract: We study the effect of stellar mass segregation driven by collisional
relaxation within the potential well of a smooth dark matter halo. This effect
is of particular relevance for old stellar systems with short crossing times,
where small collisional perturbations accumulate over many dynamical time
scales. We run collisional $N$-body simulations tailored to the ambiguous
stellar systems Ursa Major 3/Unions 1, Delve 1 and Eridanus 3, modelling their
stellar populations as two-component systems of high- and low-mass stars,
respectively. For Ursa Major 3/Unions 1 (Delve 1), assuming a
dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio of 10, we find that after 10 Gyr of evolution,
the radial extent of its low-mass stars will be twice as large (40 per cent
larger) than that of its high-mass stars. We show that weak tides do not alter
this relative separation of half-light radii, whereas for the case of strong
tidal fields, mass segregation facilitates the tidal stripping of low-mass
stars. We further find that as the population of high-mass stars contracts and
cools, the number of dynamically formed binaries within that population
increases. Our results call for caution when using stellar mass segregation as
a criterion to separate star clusters from dwarf galaxies, and suggest that
mass segregation increases the abundance of massive binaries in the central
regions of dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies.

**TL;DR**: 研究通过分析49个附近富含气体的矮星系和大质量盘状星系的样本，揭示了恒星质量、气体质量、重子质量和暗物质晕质量之间的关系，并发现了一类重子不足的矮星系，为星系形成和反馈机制提供了新见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 恒星质量、气体质量、重子质量和暗物质晕质量之间的关系为星系形成和宇宙学提供了独特的约束条件，这些关系的形状和分散性反映了星系通过气体吸积、恒星形成和反馈调节其生长的机制。

Data: 使用了49个附近富含气体的矮星系和大质量盘状星系的样本，包括气体运动学和暗物质性质的旋转曲线分解数据。

Method: 通过旋转曲线分解方法推导暗物质性质，并将观测结果与半解析和流体动力学星系形成模拟进行比较。

Result: 研究发现气体质量与暗物质晕质量关系单调上升，而恒星质量与暗物质晕质量关系更复杂；发现了一类重子不足的矮星系，其恒星质量比模型预测低1-1.5个数量级；暗物质晕的浓度在质量低于10^11太阳质量时低于预期。

Abstract: (Abridged) The relations between stellar ($M_\ast$), gas ($M_{\rm gas}$),
baryonic ($M_{\rm bar} = M_\ast + M_{\rm gas}$), and dark matter halo mass
($M_{200}$) provide unique constraints on galaxy formation and cosmology. The
shape of the relations constrains how galaxies regulate their growth through
gas accretion, star formation, and feedback; their scatter probes the
stochasticity of galaxy assembly.
  Here, we assemble a sample of 49 nearby gas-rich dwarf and massive disc
galaxies with unmatched ancillary data. We obtain their gas kinematics and
derive their dark matter properties through rotation curve decomposition. Our
sample allows us to study the galaxy-halo connection across nearly six orders
of magnitude in $M_\ast$. We find that the $M_{\rm gas}-M_{200}$ relation rises
monotonically, with galaxies having around 4 per cent of the average
cosmological baryon fraction in cold gas. Contrastingly, the $M_\ast-M_{200}$
relation shows a more complex behaviour. A particularly interesting finding is
that of a population of baryon-deficient' dwarfs (BDDs) with stellar masses
$\sim 1-1.5$ orders of magnitude lower than expected from current models. Yet,
baryon-rich galaxies also exist, and we find a large spread in the baryon
retention fraction across our galaxies. We compare our findings with
semi-analytic and hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations. While the
simulations broadly reproduce most observed features, they struggle to match
the BDDs and do not capture the diversity in baryon fractions. Understanding
these differences will shed new light on how feedback regulates galaxy
formation. Finally, we study the dark matter halo concentration-mass relation.
We find that below $M_{200} \sim 10^{11}\,M_\odot$, the concentrations are
systematically lower than expected. We discuss whether these results stem from
the influence of baryonic physics or the environment.

### [5] [The Co-Evolution of Stellar Wind-blown Bubbles and Photoionized Gas I: Physical Principles and a Semi-Analytic Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22730)
*Lachlan Lancaster,Jeong-Gyu Kim,Greg L. Bryan,Shyam H. Menon,Eve C. Ostriker,Chang-Goo Kim*

**TL;DR**: The study introduces a new framework for analyzing the simultaneous feedback of stellar winds and photo-ionizing radiation from massive stars, quantifying their dynamical importance and developing a semi-analytic Co-Evolution Model (CEM) to predict feedback bubble properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The research addresses the current understanding of stellar feedback mechanisms, distinguishing the roles of wind-blown bubbles (WBB) and photoionized regions (PIR) in shaping feedback bubbles (FB), and highlights the need for a more nuanced model to account for their co-evolution.

Data: The study uses theoretical calculations and comparisons with star-forming regions in Milky Way-like giant molecular clouds (GMCs), massive OB stars, and dense, low-metallicity environments relevant to the early universe.

Method: The authors propose a semi-analytic Co-Evolution Model (CEM) that accounts for the spatial distribution of forces and the back reactions of both WBB and PIR, and compare it to naive predictions and hydro-dynamical simulations.

Result: The CEM shows significant differences in feedback bubble momentum (up to 25%) and WBB properties (factors greater than 2) compared to naive predictions, particularly in regimes where both WBB and PIR are dynamically important.

Abstract: We propose a new framework for the simultaneous feedback of stellar winds and
photo-ionizing radiation from massive stars, distinguishing the locations where
forces are applied, and consequences for internal spatio-temporal evolution of
the whole feedback bubble (FB). We quantify the relative dynamical importance
of wind-blown bubbles (WBB) versus the photoionized region (PIR) by the ratio
of the radius at which the WBB is in pressure equilibrium with the PIR, $R_{\rm
eq}$, to the Str\"{o}mgren radius, $R_{\rm St}$. $\zeta \equiv R_{\rm
eq}/R_{\rm St}$ quantifies the dynamical dominance of WBBs ($\zeta > 1$) or the
PIR ($\zeta < 1$). We calculate $\zeta$ and find that, for momentum-driven
winds, $0.1 \lesssim \zeta \lesssim 1$ for the star-forming regions in (i)
typical Milky Way-like giant molecular clouds (GMCs), (ii) the most massive of
individual OB stars, and (iii) dense, low-metallicity environments, relevant in
the early universe. In this regime, both WBBs and the PIR are dynamically
important to the expansion of the FB. We develop a semi-analytic Co-Evolution
Model (CEM) that takes into account the spatial distribution of forces and the
back reactions of both the WBB and PIR. In the $\zeta <1$ regime where the CEM
is most relevant, the model differs in the total FB momentum by up to 25%
compared to naive predictions. In the weak-wind limit of $\zeta \ll 1$,
applicable to individual OB stars or low-mass clusters, the CEM has factors
$\gtrsim 2$ differences in WBB properties. In a companion paper we compare
these models to three-dimensional, turbulent hydro-dynamical simulations.

*Lachlan Lancaster,Chang-Goo Kim,Jeong-Gyu Kim,Eve C. Ostriker,Greg L. Bryan*

**TL;DR**: 本文通过三维辐射磁流体动力学模拟验证了共演化模型（CEM）在银河系大质量恒星形成云中的适用性，发现CEM虽优于以往理想化模型但仍存在偏差，并揭示了偏差来源及光致电离气体对风泡动力学的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 在伴篇论文（Paper I）中，作者提出了一个共演化模型（CEM），用于研究大质量恒星通过恒星风和电离辐射驱动的反馈泡的演化，并指出这两种效应的主导条件及其共同演化模型。本文在此基础上进一步探讨了银河系大质量恒星形成云中这两种反馈机制的作用。

Data: 本文使用了三维辐射磁流体动力学（RMHD）模拟数据，参数设定为银河系大质量恒星形成云的典型条件。

Method: 采用了三维辐射磁流体动力学（RMHD）模拟方法，对共演化模型（CEM）进行了验证和改进。

Result: 研究发现，CEM在关键参数上与模拟结果偏差在25%以内，且优于以往理想化模型，但偏差仍然存在，主要源于CEM未考虑湍流引起的背景不均匀性和风泡中时间依赖的动量增强。此外，光致电离气体通过减少风泡表面积降低了界面冷却，从而增强了风泡的动力学影响。

Abstract: In a companion paper (Paper I) we presented a Co-Evolution Model (CEM) in
which to consider the evolution of feedback bubbles driven by massive stars
through both stellar winds and ionizing radiation, outlining when either of
these effects is dominant and providing a model for how they evolve together.
Here we present results from three-dimensional radiation magneto-hydrodynamical
(RMHD) simulations of this scenario for parameters typical of massive
star-forming clouds in the Milky Way: precisely the regime where we expect both
feedback mechanisms to matter. While we find that the CEM agrees with the
simulations to within 25% for key parameters and modestly outperforms previous
idealized models, disagreements remain. We show that these deviations originate
mainly from the CEM's lack of (i) background inhomogeneity caused by turbulence
and (ii) time-variable momentum enhancements in the wind-blown bubble (WBB).
Additionally, we find that photoionized gas acts similarly to magnetic fields
([as in Lancaster et al. 2024a) by decreasing the WBB's surface area. This
causes a decrease in the amount of cooling at the WBB's interface, resulting in
an enhanced WBB dynamical impact.

Abstract: It is necessary to understand the full accretion history of the Milky Way in
order to contextualize the properties of observed Milky Way satellite galaxies
and the stellar halo. This paper compares the dynamical properties and
star-formation histories of surviving and disrupted satellites around Milky
Way-like galaxies using the DC Justice League suite of very high-resolution
cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way analogs and their halo
environments. We analyze the full census of galaxies accreted within the past
12 Gyrs, which including both surviving satellites at $z=0$, and dwarf galaxies
that disrupted and merged with the host prior to $z=0$. Our simulations
successfully reproduce the trends in $M_*$-[Fe/H]-[$\alpha$/Fe] observed in
surviving Milky Way satellites and disrupted stellar streams, indicating
earlier star-formation for disrupted progenitors. We find the likelihood and
timescales for quenching and disruption are strongly correlated with the mass
and time of infall. In particular, none of the galaxies accreted more than 12
Gyrs ago survived, and only 20% of all accreted galaxies with $M_*>10^8M_\odot$
survive. Additionally, satellites with highly radial trajectories are more
likely to quench and disrupt. Disruption proceeds quickly for $\geq10^6M_\odot$
satellites accreted $10{-}12$ Gyr ago, often on timescales similar to the
$\sim300$ Myr snapshot spacing. For high-mass satellites, the disruption
timescale is faster than the quenching timescale. As a result, 92% of disrupted
galaxies remain star-forming up until disruption. In contrast, Ultra Faint
Dwarfs (UFDs) tend to quench prior to accretion, and 94% of UFDs accreted up to
12 Gyr ago survive at $z=0$.

**TL;DR**: 本研究通过建模高吸积率类星体的宽波段光谱能量分布（SED），揭示了其与低吸积率活动星系核（AGN）的显著差异，并分析了射电特性与FeII发射之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 理解活动星系核（AGN）宽波段光谱能量分布（SED）对研究其辐射过程和发射线形成机制至关重要，但目前对高吸积率类星体的SED特征尚不充分。

Data: 研究使用了155个红移约1以内的极端种群A类星体的观测数据，包括光学FeII发射与H-beta强度的比值（RFeII > 1）以及射电、X射线等波段数据。

Method: 基于天文数据库中的观测数据和吸积盘模型（用于不可观测的远紫外波段），构建了从射电到X射线波段的射电宁静类星体SED中值模型。

Result: 研究发现高吸积率类星体的SED具有明显的蓝凸起和强光学/紫外发射，且X射线连续谱陡峭；射电中间型和部分射电宁静AGN显示出显著的远红外超量，可能与FeII发射的显著性相关。

Abstract: Knowledge of the broad-band active galactic nuclei (AGN) spectral energy
distribution (SED) that ionizes the gas-rich broad emission line region is key
to understanding the various radiative processes at play and their importance
that eventually leads to the emission line formation. We modeled a spectral
energy distribution for highly accreting quasars, also known as extreme
population A sources, based mainly on observational data available in
astronomical databases, and on accretion disk models for the unobservable
far-UV domain. Our selection criterion is the RFeII parameter - the ratio of
the optical FeII emission between 4434 A and 4684 A to the H-beta 4861 A
intensity, RFeII > 1. This criterion is satisfied by highly-accreting, possibly
super-Eddington, black holes. We analyzed 155 sources up to a redshift of
approximately 1, previously reported in the literature, to construct a median
radio-quiet SED spanning from radio to X-ray wavelengths. We find that the SED
of quasars exhibits distinct features compared to lower accreting AGN,
including a pronounced big blue bump and strong optical/UV emission along with
a steep X-ray continuum. We classify the sources into radio-quiet,
radio-intermediate, and radio-loud categories, observing that
radio-intermediate and a subsample of radio-quiet AGN show a significant far-IR
excess over the radio-quiet SED and the far-IR excess appears to be related to
the prominence of Feii emission. There is an overall consistency between the
new SED and the one obtained for high Eddington ratio quasars in previous work.
We provide the SEDs in digital format for eventual applications.

<details>

Background: 高质量恒星形成区（HMSFRs）的演化过程需要可靠的化学时钟来追踪，但目前的研究尚不完善。

Data: 使用IRAM 30米望远镜对88个超紧凑HII区（UC HIIs）进行了N2H+ J = 1-0、CCS JN = 87-76和77-66谱线的观测。

Method: 通过观测N2H+和CCS分子谱线，结合气体-尘埃化学模型，分析了N(N2H+)/N(CCS)比值随HMSFRs演化的变化。

Result: 研究发现N(N2H+)/N(CCS)比值从高质量无星核（HMSCs）到高质量原恒星核（HMPOs）再到UC HIIs逐渐增加，表明其可作为HMSFRs的化学时钟。

Abstract: Using the IRAM 30 m telescope, we presented observations of N2H+ J = 1-0, CCS
JN = 87-76 and 77-66 lines toward a large sample of ultracompact HII regions
(UC HIIs). Among our 88 UC HIIs, 87 and 33 sources were detected in the N2H+ J
= 1-0 and CCS JN = 87-76 lines, respectively. For the CCS 77-66 transition, we
detected emission in 10 out of 82 targeted sources, all of which also exhibited
emission in the CCS JN = 87-76 line. Physical parameters are derived for our
detections, including the optical depth and excitation temperature of N2H+, the
rotational temperature of CCS and the column density. Combining our results and
previous observation results in different stages of high-mass star-forming
regions (HMSFRs), we found that the column density ratio N(N2H+)/N(CCS)
increases from high-mass starless cores (HMSCs) through high-mass protostellar
cores (HMPOs) to UC HIIs. This implies that N(N2H+)/N(CCS) can trace the
evolution process of HMSFRs. It was supported by our gas-grain chemical model,
which shows that N(N2H+)/N(CCS) increases with the evolution age of HMSFRs. The
temperature, density and chemical age were also constrained from our best-fit
model at each stage. Thus, we propose N(N2H+)/N(CCS) as a reliable chemical
clock of HMSFRs.

Abstract: Euclid is delivering optical and near-infrared imaging data over 14,000
deg$^2$ on the sky at spatial resolution and surface brightness levels that can
be used to understand the morphological transformation of galaxies within
groups and clusters. Using the Early Release Observations (ERO) of the Perseus
cluster, we demonstrate the capability offered by Euclid in studying the nature
of perturbations for galaxies in clusters. Filamentary structures are observed
along the discs of two spiral galaxies with no extended diffuse emission
expected from tidal interactions at surface brightness levels of $\sim$
$30\,{\rm mag}\,{\rm arcsec}^{-2}$. The detected features exhibit a good
correspondence in morphology between optical and near-infrared wavelengths,
with a surface brightness of $\sim$ $25\,{\rm mag}\,{\rm arcsec}^{-2}$, and the
knots within the features have sizes of $\sim$ 100 pc, as observed through
$I_E$ imaging. Using the Euclid, CFHT, UVIT, and LOFAR $144\,{\rm MHz}$ radio
continuum observations, we conduct a detailed analysis to understand the origin
of the detected features. We constructed the \textit{Euclid} $I_E-Y_E$,
$Y_E-H_E$, and CFHT $u - r$, $g - i$ colour-colour plane and showed that these
features contain recent star formation events, which are also indicated by
their H$\alpha$ and NUV emissions. Euclid colours alone are insufficient for
studying stellar population ages in unresolved star-forming regions, which
require multi-wavelength optical imaging data. The morphological shape,
orientation, and mean age of the stellar population, combined with the presence
of extended radio continuum cometary tails can be consistently explained if
these features have been formed during a recent ram-pressure stripping event.
This result further confirms the exceptional qualities of Euclid in the study
of galaxy evolution in dense environments.

**TL;DR**: 通过高分辨率模拟研究了15个质量范围在10^5到10^7太阳质量的迷你晕在红移17至20时的第一代恒星形成过程，发现超音速湍流在迷你晕中普遍存在并促进了恒星形成云的碎片化。

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域对第一代恒星形成的迷你晕中的气体动力学和湍流作用了解有限，本研究通过高分辨率模拟填补了这一空白。

Data: 使用了来自TNG宇宙学模拟的初始条件，并通过粒子分裂技术将分辨率提高了约10^5倍，气体和暗物质粒子质量分别达到0.2太阳质量和80太阳质量。

Method: 使用GIZMO代码进行高分辨率模拟，结合了原始气体物理学的详细模型，并应用粒子分裂技术提高分辨率。

Result: 研究发现迷你晕中的湍流以超音速为主，马赫数在1.8至4.2之间，湍流促进了气体云的碎片化，形成了多个致密团块，部分团块最终塌缩形成第一代恒星。

Abstract: We present high-resolution simulations of the first star-forming clouds in 15
minihalos with masses ranging from $\sim 10^5$ to $10^7\ \text{M}_{\odot}$ at
redshifts $z \sim 17 - 20$, using the \texttt{GIZMO} code. Our simulations
incorporate detailed primordial gas physics and adopt initial conditions from
the state-of-the-art TNG cosmological simulations. To achieve the required
resolution, we apply a particle-splitting technique that increases the
resolution of the original TNG data by a factor of $\sim 10^5$, reaching gas
and dark matter particle masses of $0.2\ \text{M}_{\odot}$ and $80\
\text{M}_{\odot}$, respectively. This enables us to resolve gas accretion
during the early assembly of minihalos and to capture the emergence of strong
turbulent flows. We find that turbulence, driven by gas infall into the dark
matter potential wells, is predominantly supersonic, with characteristic Mach
numbers ranging from $1.8$ to $4.2$, increasing with halo mass. The supersonic
turbulence effectively fragments the central gas cloud into multiple dense
clumps, some of which form gravitationally bound cores and begin to collapse
into the first stars. Our results suggest that supersonic turbulence is a
common feature in minihalos and plays a key role in generating clumpy
star-forming clouds, with important implications for the initial mass function
of the first stars.

*Kirk S. S. Barrow,Thinh Huu Nguyen,Edward C. Skrabacz*

**TL;DR**: 本文介绍了一种新的基于Python的独立晕发现算法Haskap Pie，该算法将多种晕发现和追踪方法结合到一个计算中，适用于多种模拟代码和模拟类型，并在性能上优于现有工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 现有的晕发现算法（如Rockstar和Consistent Trees）在追踪子晕、约束物理参数和生成晕质量函数方面存在不足，而Haskap Pie算法旨在解决这些问题，并适用于新一代模拟星系研究。

Data: 该算法适用于由八种模拟代码（ART-I、ENZO、RAMSES、CHANGA、GADGET-3、GEAR、AREPO和GIZMO）生成的模拟数据，包括zoom-in或全盒N体或流体动力学模拟。

Method: Haskap Pie是一种新的独立晕发现算法，结合了多种晕发现和追踪方法，无需额外的调参或用户指定的建模参数。

Result: 与Rockstar和Consistent Trees相比，Haskap Pie在追踪子晕、约束物理参数和生成晕质量函数方面表现更优，尤其适用于研究合并和卫星星系的新一代模拟。

Abstract: We describe a new Python-based stand-alone halo finding algorithm, Haskap
Pie, that combines several methods of halo finding and tracking into a single
calculation. Our halo-finder flexibly solves halos for simulations produced by
eight simulation codes (ART-I, ENZO, RAMSES, CHANGA, GADGET-3, GEAR, AREPO and
GIZMO) and for both zoom-in or full-box N-body or hydrodynamical simulations
without the need for additional tuning or user-specified modeling parameters.
When compared to Rockstar and Consistent Trees, our halo-finder tracks subhalos
much longer and more consistently, produces halos with better constrained
physical parameters, and returns a much denser halo mass function for halos
with more than 100 particles. Our results also compare favorably to recently
described specialized particle-tracking extensions to Rockstar. Our algorithm
is well-suited to a variety of studies of simulated galaxies and is
particularly robust for a new generation of studies of merging and satellite
galaxies.

*Anthony Englert,Ian Dell'Antonio,Mireia Montes*

**TL;DR**: 利用DECam观测数据模拟LSST的八年深度数据，研究Abell 3667星系团内的团内光，发现连接两个最亮星系的光学桥，推测其形成于一次大合并事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 团内光是星系团形成过程中从星系剥离的恒星发出的弥散光，是研究星系团动力学历史的重要示踪物。即将到来的Vera C. Rubin天文台的LSST巡天将彻底改变团内光的研究。

Data: 使用DECam对Abell 3667的观测数据，模拟LSST八年深度的数据集。

Method: 通过分析DECam观测数据，研究团内光的分布和特性。

Result: 发现一个低表面亮度的光学桥，延伸约400 kpc，连接星系团中两个最亮星系（BCG1和BCG2），其颜色和表面亮度表明其形成于一次大合并事件。BCG1和BCG2的内部分布表明其形成于卫星星系的逐渐剥离，但BCG2的外部分布显示出近期合并的迹象。

Abstract: Intracluster light, the diffuse glow of stars stripped from galaxies during a
cluster's formation, is an established tracer of a cluster's dynamical history.
The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)
is set to revolutionize studies of intracluster light by imaging the entire
southern sky down to a limiting surface brightness $\mu \gtrsim
30\text{mag}/\text{arcsec}^2$ by year ten. In this letter, we create a
precursor LSST dataset (reaching the equivalent of year eight depth) using
DECam observations of Abell 3667 and study its intracluster light. We have
discovered a low surface brightness ($ \mu \gtrsim 26\text{mag}/\text{arcsec}^2
$) optical bridge extending over $\sim 400\text{ kpc}$ which connects the two
brightest galaxies (BCG1 and BCG2) in the cluster; the color and surface
brightness of the bridge is consistent with formation via a major merger. The
inner regions of BCG1 ($r < 200\text{ kpc}$) and BCG2 ($r < 50\text{ kpc}$) are
consistent with formation via gradual stripping of satellite galaxies, but
BCG2's outer profile appears disrupted by a recent merger. We hypothesize that
the bridge is a relic of a recent first-pass between the two brightest galaxies
and is composed of stars being stripped from BCG2. Future studies of
intracluster light with LSST will discover new features such as the bridge in
local clusters while enabling detailed studies of the stellar populations of
these features with its six photometric bands.

**TL;DR**: 通过微引力透镜事件MOA-2022-BLG-091和KMT-2024-BLG-1209的分析，发现其异常特征源于行星系统，揭示了巨行星的存在及其轨道特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 微引力透镜事件MOA-2022-BLG-091和KMT-2024-BLG-1209的光变曲线显示出相似的异常特征，这些异常出现在光变曲线的峰值附近，具有弱焦散交叉特征，且源在焦散内时变形极小。

Data: 使用了MOA-2022-BLG-091和KMT-2024-BLG-1209微引力透镜事件的光变曲线数据。

Method: 通过二元透镜模型对参数空间进行全面探索，并进行了贝叶斯分析。

Result: 分析表明，两个透镜系统中的行星均为质量约为木星2至4倍的巨行星，围绕早期K型主序星运行，系统可能位于银河系盘内约4千秒差距的距离处。MOA-2022-BLG-091的异常解释受新发现的轨道角度不确定性影响，而KMT-2024-BLG-1209则受已知的内外焦散区域退化影响。未来Roman RGES微引力透镜观测有望解决MOA-2022-BLG-091的退化问题。

Abstract: The light curves of the microlensing events MOA-2022-BLG-091 and
KMT-2024-BLG-1209 exhibit anomalies with very similar features. These anomalies
appear near the peaks of the light curves, where the magnifications are
moderately high, and are distinguished by weak caustic-crossing features with
minimal distortion while the source remains inside the caustic. To achieve a
deeper understanding of these anomalies, we conducted a comprehensive analysis
of the lensing events. We carried out binary-lens modeling with a thorough
exploration of the parameter space. This analysis revealed that the anomalies
in both events are of planetary origin, although their exact interpretation is
complicated by different types of degeneracy. In the case of MOA-2022-BLG-091,
the main difficulty in the interpretation of the anomaly arises from a newly
identified degeneracy related to the uncertain angle at which the source
trajectory intersects the planet-host axis. For KMT-2024-BLG-1209, the
interpretation is affected by the previously known inner-outer degeneracy,
which leads to ambiguity between solutions in which the source passes through
either the inner or outer caustic region relative to the planet host. Bayesian
analysis indicates that the planets in both lens systems are giant planets with
masses about 2 to 4 times that of Jupiter, orbiting early K-type main-sequence
stars. Both systems are likely located in the Galactic disk at a distance of
around 4 kiloparsecs. The degeneracy in KMT-2024-BLG-1209 is challenging to
resolve because it stems from intrinsic similarities in the caustic structures
of the degenerate solutions. In contrast, the degeneracy in MOA-2022-BLG-091,
which occurs by chance rather than from inherent characteristics, is expected
to be resolved by the future space based Roman RGES microlensing survey.

### [15] [Hydrodynamic simulations of black hole evolution in AGN discs I: orbital alignment of highly inclined satellites](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23739)
*Connar Rowan,Henry Whitehead,Gaia Fabj,Philip Kirkeberg,Martin E. Pessah,Bence Kocsis*

**TL;DR**: The study investigates the evolution of black holes on inclined orbits in AGN discs through hydrodynamical simulations, revealing that radiation pressure dominates the wake formation and inclination damping follows a power law, suggesting faster capture of inclined objects by the disc than previously thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The research explores the dynamics of black holes in AGN discs, focusing on their interactions and evolution on inclined orbits, addressing gaps in understanding the role of radiation pressure and wake morphology in inclination damping.

Data: The study uses hydrodynamical simulations of isolated black hole disc crossings across a range of disc densities and inclinations (i ∈ [2°, 15°]).

Method: Adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations are performed to analyze the wake formation and inclination damping behavior of black holes in AGN discs.

Result: The results indicate radiation dominates wake pressure, inclination damping follows a power law, and the damping timescale is shorter than expected, implying faster capture of inclined objects by the disc.

Abstract: The frequency of compact object interactions in AGN discs is naturally tied
to the number of objects embedded within it. We investigate the evolution of
black holes in the nuclear stellar cluster on inclined orbits to the AGN disc
by performing adiabatic hydrodynamical simulations of isolated black hole disc
crossings over a range of disc densities and inclinations
$i\in[2^\circ,15^\circ]$. We find radiation dominates the pressure in the wake
that forms around the BH across the full inclination and disc density range. We
identify no well defined steady state wake morphology due to the thin geometry
of the disc and the vertical exponential density drop off, where the wake
morphology depends on the vertical depth of the transit within the disc. The
inclination damping $\Delta i$ relative the pre-transit inclination behaves as
a power law in $\sin(i)$ and the ambient Hill mass $m_\text{H,0}$ as $\Delta
i/i \propto m_{\rm H,0}^{0.4} \sin(i)^{-2.7}$. The drag on the BH is dominated
by the gravity of the wake for the majority of our inclination range until
accretion effects become comparable at $\sin(i)\gtrsim30H_0/R_0$, where
$H_0/R_0$ is the disc aspect ratio. At low inclinations
($\sin(i)\lesssim3H_0/R_0$) the wake morphology becomes more spherical, leading
to a regime change in the inclination damping behaviour. Our results suggest
that the inclination damping timescale is shorter than expected from only
episodic Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttelton accretion events during each transit, implying
inclined objects may captured by the AGN disc earlier in its lifetime than
previously thought.
