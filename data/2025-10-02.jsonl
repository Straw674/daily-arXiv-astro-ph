Observations of the accreted stellar halo show that it is triaxial\nand tilted with respect to the disc. If this configuration is long-lived, it\ncan be used to place constraints on the shape and orientation of the dark\nmatter halo that can support it close to steady state. We fit equilibrium\norbit-superposition (Schwarzschild) models to the stellar halo in a realistic\nMilky Way potential with a tilted dark matter halo, assuming that the long axes\nof each halo and the disc normal are coplanar. These models are matched to\nparametric density fits and velocity anisotropy measurements of Gaia\nSausage-Enceladus (GSE) stars at radii $r\\in[6,60]$ kpc. The observations are\nconsistent with a (near-)prolate dark matter halo whose density has a\nshort-to-long axis ratio of $q_\\mathrm{dm}=0.87_{-0.09}^{+0.05}$. The long axis\nis inclined at an angle of $\\beta_\\mathrm{dm}=43_{-8}^{+22}\\,^\\circ$ to the\ndisc plane, which exceeds the stellar halo tilt by $\\approx18^\\circ$. Spherical\nhaloes cannot support the observed structure of the GSE in equilibrium. The\nbest-fitting dynamical GSE model has a radius-dependent shape and orientation;\nbetween radii of 6 and 60 kpc the tilt increases from\n$\\beta_*(r)\\approx10^\\circ$ to $\\approx35^\\circ$. Our model provides a good fit\nto the observed triaxial structure and dynamics of the GSE. It is therefore an\nexcellent source of realistic initial conditions for simulations of the halo,\nsuch as for investigating perturbations from satellites or the Galactic bar."}

To this\nend, we introduce a new approach (SHAPE, SOM-SED Hybrid Approach for efficient\nParameter Estimation) that can bridge different photometric systems and\nefficiently estimate key galaxy parameters, such as stellar mass ($M_\\star$)\nand star formation rate (SFR), leveraging data from a large and deep\nJWST/NIRCam and MIRI survey (PRIMER).

To mitigate discrepancies between input colors and\nthe training set, we replace the default SOM weights with stacked SEDs from\neach cell, extending the applicability of our model to other photometric\ncatalogs (e.g., COSMOS2020). By incorporating a SED library (SED Lib), we apply\nthis JWST-calibrated model to the COSMOS2020 catalog. Despite the limited\nsample size and potential template-related uncertainties, SOM-derived\nparameters exhibit a good agreement with results from SED-fitting using\nextended photometry. Under identical photometric constraints from CSST and\nEuclid bands, our method outperforms traditional SED-fitting techniques in SFR\nestimation, exhibiting both a reduced bias (-0.01 vs. 0.18) and a smaller\n$\\sigma_{\\rm NMAD}$ (0.25 vs. 0.35).

Given these PBHs have very small masses,\ntheir Hawking temperature can be up to hundreds of keV. This study investigates\nthe potential impacts of PBH Hawking radiation on the intergalactic medium from\n$z\\sim 800-25$, namely studying the ionization history, kinetic gas\ntemperature, and ultimately the 21 cm signature. We find that for masses on the\nlow edge of the asteroid mass window, there are up two orders of magnitude\nincreases in the ionization fraction and kinetic gas temperature by redshift\n25, and the 21 cm spin temperature can differ from non-PBH cosmology by factors\nof a few. This analysis results in maximum differential brightness temperatures\nof +17 mK for our lightest PBH masses of $2.12\\times 10^{16}$g. We also show\nmaximal $53$ mK discrepancies in differential brightness temperatures between\nour PBH and non-PBH cosmologies for our lightest PBH mass, while our heaviest\nPBH mass of $1.65 \\times 10^{17}$g shows only $0.5$ mK variations. We find the\nHawking-radiated electrons and positrons are instrumental in driving these IGM\nmodifications. This study shows the necessity for a rigorous treatment of\nHawking radiation in PBH cosmological observables from the dark ages through\ncosmic dawn."}

We present a deep XMM-Newton observation of the massive, edge-on\ngalaxy NGC 5746. The total exposure time of 250 ks provides unprecedented\nsensitivity to study the diffuse hot gas in the halo, significantly surpassing\nthe depth of previous observations. Aims. While the presence of hot,\ncircumgalactic gas is well tested for starburst galaxies, detections in normal\ngalaxies remain scarce. By studying the diffuse X-ray emission in NGC 5746, we\naim to provide new insights into the evolution of star-forming galaxies and\ntheir surroundings. Methods. We create X-ray images and surface brightness\nprofiles to quantify the distribution of extraplanar gas in the halo of NGC\n5746. In addition, we isolate the diffuse emission component from point source-\nand background-contamination and study the spectral characteristics of the hot\nplasma. Results. We detect soft X-ray emission out to 40 kpc from the galactic\ndisc. The gas distribution is reminiscent of a stellar outflow, with two\nbubbles extending perpendicular to the disc in a biconical shape. The spectral\nanalysis of the halo emission yields a plasma temperature of 0.56 keV, higher\nthan the typical values observed in spiral galaxies (0.2 keV). The disc has an\neven higher plasma temperature of 0.7 keV, and is dominated by non-thermal\nemission from unresolved X-ray binaries. The signs of a stellar outflow, bright\nX-ray emission, and high plasma temperatures indicate that the star-forming\nactivity in NGC 5746 might be higher than previously thought. Conclusions. Our\nresults demonstrate that massive spiral galaxies can host luminous X-ray halos,\nand support theoretical models that predict their existence. Earlier claims of\na lack of hot gas around quiescent spirals might be attributed to the detection\nthresholds in shallower observations, stressing the need for more, deeper\nobservations of non-starburst galaxies."}

The most\nsignificant deviations from the cold DM (CDM) paradigm arise in the\ndwarf-galaxy regime, where FDM dynamical friction can stall the inspiral of GCs\nover a Hubble time, thereby preventing their sinking into galactic centers and\nhalting the canonical galactic cannibalism of clusters.

Moreover, these massive starbursts typically\nhave star-forming companions which are unaccounted for in this tally. We\ndemonstrate a strong correlation between Einstein radius and typical time\ndelays, with cluster lenses often exceeding several months (and therefore most\nfavorable for high-precision $H_0$ inferences). A multi-visit monitoring\ncampaign with a sensitive infrared telescope (namely, JWST) is necessary to\nmitigate dust attenuation. Still, a porous interstellar medium and clumpy star\nformation in these extreme galaxies might produce favorable conditions for\ndetecting supernovae as transient point sources. Targeted campaigns of known\nlensed galaxies to discover new lensed supernovae can greatly complement\nwide-area cadenced surveys. Increasing the sample size helps to realize the\npotential of supernova time-delay cosmography to elucidate the Hubble tension\nthrough a single-step measurement, independent of other $H_0$ techniques."}

Core-collapse Supernovae of Type II contribute the chemical\nenrichment of galaxies through explosion. Their role as dust producers in the\nhigh-redshift Universe may be of paramount importance. However, the type and\namount of dust they synthesise after outburst is still a matter of debate and\nthe formation processes remain unclear.\n  Aims. We aim to identify and understand the chemical processes at play in the\ndust formation scenario, and derive mass yields for molecules and dust clusters\nat late post-explosion time. Methods. We revisit existing models by improving\non the physics and chemistry of the supernova ejecta. We identify and consider\nnew chemical species and pathways underpinning the formation of dust clusters,\nand apply a unique exhaustive chemical network to the entire ejecta of a\nSupernova with a 15 Msun progenitor. We test this new chemistry for various gas\nconditions in the ejecta, and derive mass yields for molecules and dust\nclusters.\n  Results. We obtain the molecular component of the ejecta up to 11 years after\nexplosion. The most abundant species are, in order of decreasing masses, O2,\nCO, SiS, SiO, CO2, SO2, CaS, N2, and CS. We identify molecules that are tracers\nof high-density clumps. As for dust clusters, we find the composition is\ndominated by silicates and silica, along with carbon dust, but with modest\namounts of alumina. Pure metal clusters and metal sulphide and oxide clusters\nhave negligible masses. High-density gas favours the formation of carbon\nclusters in the outer ejecta region whereas low temperatures hamper the\nformation of silicates in the oxygen core. The results are in good agreement\nwith existing astronomical data and recent observations with the James Webb\nSpace Telescope. They highlight the importance of chemistry for the derivation\nof dust budget from Supernovae."}

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "We present a new implementation of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) dynamical friction\nwithin the galpy framework, enabling orbital integrations of globular clusters\n(GCs) across a broad range of halo-to-GC mass ratios and boson masses. In this\nalternative DM scenario, dynamical friction is reduced or even suppressed by\nheating induced by FDM density granules. We further quantify the role of\nbaryons and solitonic cores, natural consequences of FDM in galaxies, on the\nefficiency of orbital decay and the long-term survival of GCs. The most\nsignificant deviations from the cold DM (CDM) paradigm arise in the\ndwarf-galaxy regime, where FDM dynamical friction can stall the inspiral of GCs\nover a Hubble time, thereby preventing their sinking into galactic centers and\nhalting the canonical galactic cannibalism of clusters. Importantly, our\nFDM-only friction model should be regarded as a conservative lower bound, since\nthe inclusion of realistic FDM cores can only strengthen the survival of GCs\nthrough core stalling. This stalling mechanism not only preserves in-situ\npopulations that would otherwise be erased in CDM, but also strongly suppresses\nthe mixing of in-situ and ex-situ clusters, yielding a bimodal radial\ndistribution of GCs. Our results show that the demographics of GC systems\nencode a distinct dynamical signature of FDM in dwarfs. These predictions open\na new pathway to constrain the boson mass parameter with upcoming Euclid DR1\nobservations of extragalactic GCs, while simultaneously offering a natural\nexplanation for the long-standing Fornax timing problem."}
