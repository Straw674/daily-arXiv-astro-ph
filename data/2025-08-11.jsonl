However, validating whether our\ntheoretical models accurately describe the observed datasets remains a\nfundamental challenge. An additional complexity to this task comes from\nchoosing appropriate representations of the data which retain all the relevant\ncosmological information, while reducing the dimensionality of the original\ndataset. In this work we present a novel framework combining scale-dependent\nneural summary statistics with normalizing flows to detect model\nmisspecification in cosmological simulations through Bayesian evidence\nestimation. By conditioning our neural network models for data compression and\nevidence estimation on the smoothing scale, we systematically identify where\ntheoretical models break down in a data-driven manner. We demonstrate a first\napplication to our approach using matter and gas density fields from three\nCAMELS simulation suites with different subgrid physics implementations."}

We analyze how these\nobservations vary in $\\Lambda$CDM versus dynamic dark energy. We find that the\ngalaxy-galaxy lensing signal is reduced by up to 7% with respect to galaxy\nclustering and that cosmic shear is suppressed by 14%. These differences are\nprimarily caused by changes to cosmological distance measures which enter the\nlensing efficiency kernels. In contrast, we find that dynamic dark energy\nincreases the thermal Sunyaev Zeldovich signal by about 15%, but that this is\ninsufficient to substantially reduce the magnitude of baryonic effects. Thus,\nwe find that dynamic dark energy may help explain two out of these three\ncosmological anomalies. DESI's dynamic dark energy has an important impact on\ncosmic expansion at $z\\lesssim 0.5$, a regime where baryon acoustic\noscillations are limited by the small volume. Because lensing is sensitive to\ndistances, in addition to growth, we argue that lensing measurements are a\npromising alternative to constrain expansion deviations from $\\Lambda$ at low\nredshifts."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Stellar streams around the Milky Way (MW) can provide valuable insights into\nits history and substructure formation. Previous studies have suggested that\nseveral MW streams could have an origin related to that of the disc of\nsatellite galaxies (DoS) and the young halo globular clusters of the MW, given\nthat many of these structures present a similar orbital pole orientation. In\nthis work we test the validity of this hypothesis by revising the orbital pole\ndistribution of the MW streams with the latest stream dataset (galstreams). For\na sample of 91 streams at Galactocentric distances of $d<100$ kpc we find that\nthe pole distribution has no preferred orbital direction. However, as we\nsubtract the streams closer to the Galactic centre, by imposing several lower\ndistance cuts, we find that the larger the Galactocentric distance of the\nstreams, the higher the fraction of stream poles pointing in a direction\nsimilar to the DoS. This trend could be explained if the stream pole\ndistribution were originally anisotropic, but precession effects displaced the\norbital poles of the streams closer to the Galactic centre. From the pole\ndistribution and the estimated precession rates of the streams in the sample,\nwe infer that the streams nearer the Galactic centre are indeed quite likely to\nbe affected by precession. Finally, we corroborate with hydrodynamical\nsimulations that, even in a scenario in which the MW substructures had a common\norigin, an overdensity in their orbital pole direction cannot be appreciated\nuntil the selected sample also includes material at $d \\gtrsim 150$ kpc."}

The advent of the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) will increase the\ncollecting area by more than an order of magnitude compared to the individual\nUnit Telescopes of the Very Large Telescope (VLT).

Low-confidence detections\nof dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and/or dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) have sparked\nconsiderable debate, primarily around arguments that their absorption features\nare not uniquely identifiable. Here, we consider a different question from the\nastrobiology standards of evidence framework: Have we detected an authentic\nsignal? To answer this, we analyzed previously-published, publicly-available\nJWST observations of K2-18b using independent data reduction and spectral\nretrieval frameworks. Our comprehensive set of reductions demonstrates that the\nMIRI transit spectrum is highly susceptible to unresolved instrumental\nsystematics. Applying different wavelength binning schemes yields a potpourri\nof planet spectra that then lead to a wide assortment of atmospheric\ninterpretations. Consequently, we offer recommendations to help minimize this\npreviously-underappreciated instrument systematic in future MIRI reductions of\nany exoplanet. While the MIRI binning scheme adopted by Madhusudhan et al.\n(2025) supports a tentative detection of DMS/DMDS in K2-18b, we find that 87.5%\nof retrievals using our favored MIRI binning scheme do not. When considering\nthe full, 0.7 - 12 micron transit spectrum, we confirm the detection of CH4 and\nCO2, and find the presence of DMS and C2H4 to be interchangeable. Moreover, we\nfind that the tentative presence of large features in the MIRI transit spectrum\nis in tension with the more robust, yet smaller, features observed in the near\nIR. We conclude that red noise -- rather than an astrophysical signal --\nplagues the mid-IR data and there is, as yet, no statistically significant\nevidence for biosignatures in the atmosphere of K2-18b."}

Toward the southern filament, we also\nreport the presence of a parsec-scale, spectrally narrow SiO emission likely\ndriven by the interaction between this filament and a nearby expanding shell.\nThe shell is visible in the 1.3 GHz and 610 MHz continuum images and our\npreliminary analysis suggests it may be the relic of a supernova remnant. We\nconclude that the two filaments represent the densest part of two colliding\nclouds, pushed toward each other by nearby Supernova Remnants. We speculate\nthat this cloud-cloud collision driven by stellar feedback may have assembled\nthe infrared dark cloud. We also evaluate the possibility that star formation\nmay have been triggered within G035.39-00.33 by the collision."}

Galaxy mergers are a commonly suggested\ncatalyst for starbursts, but once the galaxies coalesce into a single\nkinematically disturbed system, their merger history can be difficult to\nassess. This is particularly true for dwarf galaxies, which are expected to\ndominate the merger rate at all redshifts due to their large numbers. One such\ndwarf galaxy undergoing an enigmatic starburst episode is Henize 2-10, which\nappears to be isolated. Possible scenarios that might have caused the starburst\nepisode include a previous merger or stochastic processes within the galaxy\nitself, such as self-regulation via feedback processes. We present new VLA\n21-cm observations and unpublished archival CARMA CO data to investigate the\ndynamical state and star formation activity in the galaxy. We do not detect an\nHI tail consistent with the structure reported by Kobulnicky et al. (1995),\nwhich was suggested as evidence for a merger or interaction, but rather these\nnew observations indicate an extended HI distribution. We also find that the HI\nappears dynamically decoupled from an extended CO feature (inferred to be a\ntidal tail in previous work), suggesting large-scale dynamical processes of\nsome type are affecting the gas in this system. We provide a meta-analysis of\navailable results to enhance our understanding of what might be triggering the\nstarburst episode in Henize 2-10, and speculate that the large CO feature could\nbe falling into the galaxy and potentially trigger starburst activity."}

Finding binary\nSMBHs in existing time-domain observations has proven difficult, as their\nperiodic, electromagnetic signals can be confused with the natural variability\nof single quasars. In this work, we investigate the effects of host-galaxy\ncontamination and survey design (cadence and duration) on the detectability of\nbinary SMBHs with the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and\nTime (LSST). We simulate millions of LSST light curves of single and binary\nquasars, with a distribution of quasar and host-galaxy properties motivated by\nempirical observations and the anticipated LSST detection space. We then apply\nsimple sinusoidal curve fits as a potential, computationally inexpensive\ndetection method. We find that host-galaxy contamination will increase\nfalse-positive rates and decrease binary parameter recovery rates. Lower mass,\nlower luminosity binary systems are most likely to be negatively affected by\nhost galaxy contamination. We also find that monitoring duration affects binary\ndetection more than survey effective cadence for this detection method. As the\nlight curve duration increases, false-positive rates are suppressed and binary\nparameter recovery rates, especially for binary period, are improved.\nIncreasing the light curve duration from 5 to 10 yrs shows the most dramatic\nimprovement for successful binary detection and false-positive rejection, with\nadditional improvement from extending the light curve duration to 20 yrs. The\nobservation duration increase is especially critical for recovering binary\nperiods that are longer than a decade."}
