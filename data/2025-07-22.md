### [1] [Prospects for studying million-degree gas in the Milky Way halo using the forbidden optical [FeX] and [FeXIV] intersystem lines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14279)
*P. Richter,F. Ruenger,N. Lehner,J. C. Howk,C. Peroux,N. Libeskind,M. Steinmetz,R. de Jong*

**TL;DR**: 通过分析[FeX]和[FeXIV]吸收线预测银河系热晕气体柱密度并给出探测阈值，为光学光谱研究热晕气体这一主要重子成分开辟新途径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 探索银河系热晕气体作为主要重子物质储库的光谱学研究。

Data: 使用VLT/UVES和KECK/HIRES的739个高分辨率AGN光谱原始样本进行叠加分析。

Method: 采用半解析模型结合HESTIA模拟和观测约束预测FeX和FeXIV柱密度及谱线特征。

Result: 预测银河系热晕中FeX和FeXIV的柱密度分别为log N(FeX)=15.40和log N(FeXIV)=15.23，但未在当前光学数据中检测到这些吸收线。

Abstract: The Milky Way is surrounded by large amounts of hot gas at temperatures
T>10^6 K, which represents a major baryon reservoir. We here explore the
prospects of studying the hot coronal gas in Milky Way halo by analyzing the
highly forbidden optical coronal lines of [FeX] and [FeXIV] in absorption
against bright extragalactic background sources. We use a semi-analytic model
of the Milky Way's coronal gas distribution together wih HESTIA simulations of
the Local Group and observational constraints to predict the expected FeX and
FeXIV column densities as well as the line shapes and strengths. We predict
column densities of log N(FeX)=15.40 and log N(FeXIV)=15.23 in the Milky Way's
hot halo and estimate that a minimum S/N of 50,000 (25,000) is required to
detect [FeX] l6374.5 ([FeXIV] l5302.9) absorption at a 3sigma level. Using
archical optical data from an original sample of 739 high resolution AGN
spectra from VLT/UVES and KECK/HIRES, we generate a stacked composite spectrum
to measure an upper limit for the column densities of FeX and FeXIV in the
Milky Way's coronal gas. No [FeX] and [FeXIV] is detected in our composite
spectrum, which achieves a maximum S/N= 1,240 near 5300 A. We derive 3sigma
upper column-density limits of log N(FeX)<16.27 and log N(FeXIV)<15.85, in line
with the above-mentioned predictions. While [FeX] and [FexIX] absorption is too
weak to be detected with current optical data, we outline how up-coming
extragalactic spectral surveys with millions of medium- to high-resolution
optical spectra will provide the necessary sensitivity and spectral resolution
to measure velocity-resolved [FeX] and [FeXIV] absorption in the Milky Way's
coronal gas (and beyond). This gives the prospect of opening a new window for
studying the dominant baryonic mass component of the Milky Way in the form of
hot coronal gas via optical spectroscopy.

### [2] [Modeling the Reverberation Response of the Broad Line Region in Active Galactic Nuclei II: Incorporating Photoionization Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14337)
*Sara Rosborough,Andrew Robinson,Triana Almeyda,Daniel Humphrey,Madison Noll*

**TL;DR**: 开发了BELMAC新版本，通过光致电离模型计算选定宽发射线的云光度，发现不同动力学模型的宽线区响应能有效指示光度加权半径，但存在负响应导致高估半径的情况，且单区与双区模型分别解释了高低电离线差异及谱线不对称性。

Background: 研究活动星系核宽发射线区（BLR）的结构和动力学特征及其对中心超大质量黑洞吸积盘电离连续谱变化的响应。

Data: 使用BELMAC模拟工具结合光致电离模型计算选定宽发射线的云光度，研究盘状宽线区在开普勒旋转、辐射驱动外流和流入情况下的速度分辨反响响应。

Method: 采用光致电离模型计算选定宽发射线的云光度，模拟盘状宽线区在开普勒旋转、辐射驱动外流和流入情况下的速度分辨反响响应。

Result: 活动星系核的宽发射线响应揭示了宽线区的结构和动力学特征，但某些情况下会出现负响应导致光度加权半径高估，且维里质量与实际超大质量黑洞质量存在显著差异。

Abstract: The broad emission lines (BELs) emitted by Active Galactic Nuclei respond to
variations in the ionizing continuum emission from the accretion disk
surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). This reverberation
response provides insights into the structure and dynamics of the Broad Line
Region (BLR). In Rosborough et al., 2024, we introduced a new forward-modeling
tool, the Broad Emission Line MApping Code (BELMAC), which simulates the
velocity-resolved reverberation response of the BLR to an input light curve. In
this work, we describe a new version of BELMAC, which uses photoionization
models to calculate the cloud luminosities for selected BELs. We investigated
the reverberation responses of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, MgII$\lambda$2800 and
CIV$\lambda$1550 for models representing a disk-like BLR with Keplerian
rotation, radiatively driven outflows, and inflows. The line responses
generally provide a good indication of the respective luminosity-weighted
radii. However, there are situations when the BLR exhibits a negative response
to the driving continuum, causing overestimates of the luminosity-weighted
radius. The virial mass derived from the models can differ dramatically from
the actual SMBH mass, depending mainly on the disk inclination and velocity
field. In single zone models, the BELs exhibit similar responses and profile
shapes; two-zone models, such as a Keplerian disk and a biconical outflow, can
reproduce observed differences between high- and low-ionization lines. Radial
flows produce asymmetric line profile shapes due to both anisotropic cloud
emission and electron scattering in an inter-cloud medium. These competing
attenuation effects complicate the interpretation of profile asymmetries.

### [3] [Double tidal disruption events in the changing-look AGN Mrk1018](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14428)
*Zhang XueGuang*

**TL;DR**: 首次发现双星潮汐瓦解事件解释了Mrk1018的光变特征，验证了黑洞质量与M-sigma关系的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究探讨了双星潮汐瓦解事件（双TDEs）作为黑洞吸积系统独特探针的潜力及其与活动星系核状态转变现象的关联。

Data: 使用了已知变脸活动星系核Mrk1018长达15年的光变曲线数据。

Method: 基于双主序星被中心超大质量黑洞潮汐瓦解的简化模型分析双TDEs。

Result: 双星潮汐瓦解事件能解释Mrk1018的光变曲线平台特征及其与变脸活动星系核特性的紧密关联。

Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) as excellent beacons to black hole (BH)
accreting systems have been studied for more than five decades with a single
star tidally disrupted by a central massive BH. However, if considering two
stars passing through a central BH and being tidally disrupted in a short
period, so-called double TDEs could be expected and lead to unique variability
features very different from features from standard TDEs. Here, we report such
oversimplified double TDEs in the known changing-look AGN Mrk1018, of which
15years-long light curve with plateau features can be described by two
main-sequence stars tidally disrupted by the central supermassive BH.
Meanwhile, the BH mass determined by the double TDEs is consistent with the
M-sigma relation determined value by the measured stellar velocity dispersions
in Mrk1018. The results indicate tight connections between the TDEs and the
changing-look properties in Mrk1018.

### [4] [ALMA-IMF XIX: C18O (J=2-1): Measurements of turbulence in 15 massive protoclusters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14502)
*A. Koley,A. M. Stutz,F. Louvet,F. Motte,A. Ginsburg,R. Galván-Madrid,R. H. Álvarez-Gutiérrez,P. Sanhueza,T. Baug,N. Sandoval-Garrido,J. Salinas,G. Busquet,J. Braine,H. -L. Liu,T. Csengeri,A. Gusdorf,M. Fernández-López,N. Cunningham,L. Bronfman,M. Bonfand*

**TL;DR**: 通过C18O(2-1)谱线分析15个银河系大质量原星团的湍流特性，发现其密度区呈现超音速湍流且核心非热速度弥散约为外围气体的一半，尺寸-线宽关系幂律指数(0.41-0.64)符合可压缩介质预期。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 探索银河系大质量原星团中湍流特性及其与核心质量函数起源的关系。

Data: 数据来源于ALMA对15个银河系大质量原星团的C18O(2-1)和DCN(3-2)谱线观测。

Method: 采用C18O(2-1)发射线的声速马赫数分析和尺寸-线宽关系研究原星团湍流特性。

Result: 核心结论：C18O(2-1)发射线分析显示原星团内部湍流具有超音速性质，马赫数峰值在4至7之间且无显著演化趋势，且核心非热速度弥散约为周围气体的一半，表明湍流在较小尺度或核心外围减弱。

Abstract: ALMA-IMF is a large program of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) that aims to determine the origin of the core mass function (CMF)
of 15 massive Galactic protoclusters (~ 1.0-25.0 x 10^3 solar mass within ~ 2.5
x 2.5 pc^2 ) located towards the Galactic plane. In addition, the objective of
the program is to obtain a thorough understanding of their physical and
kinematic properties. Here we study the turbulence in these protoclusters with
C18O (2-1) emission line using the sonic Mach number analysis (M_s ) and the
size-linewidth relation. The probability distribution functions (PDFs) for M_s
show a similar pattern, exhibiting no clear trend associated with evolutionary
stage, peaking in the range between 4 and 7, and then extending to ~ 25. Such
values of M_s indicate that the turbulence in the density regime traced by the
C18O line inside the protoclusters is supersonic in nature. In addition, we
compare the non-thermal velocity dispersions (sigma_nth, C18O) obtained from
the C18O(2-1) line with the non-thermal line widths (sigma_nth, DCN ) of the
cores obtained from the DCN (3-2) line. We observe that, on average, the
non-thermal linewidth in cores is half that of the gas surrounding them. This
suggests that turbulence diminishes at smaller scales or dissipates at the
periphery of the cores. Furthermore, we examine the size-linewidth relation for
the structures we extracted from the position-position-velocity C18O(2-1) line
emission cube with dendrogram algorithm. The power-law index (p) obtained from
the size-linewidth relation is between 0.41 and 0.64, steeper than the
Kolmogorov law of turbulence, as expected for compressible media. In
conclusion, this work is one of the first to carry out such a statistical study
of turbulence for embedded massive protoclusters.

**TL;DR**: 在70微米暗团块G34.74-0.12中发现了一个源自9.7太阳质量核心的极年轻原恒星外流，其红移瓣中存在无锚定分叉流结构，揭示了初始恒星形成阶段比以往认知更复杂。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究恒星形成初期阶段中年轻原恒星外流的复杂形态和动力学特征。

Data: 数据来源于ALMA 1.3毫米波段观测，角分辨率为1''.6（约5000天文单位），包括CO (2-1)、SiO (5-4)和H2CO (3-0,3-2-0,2)的分子谱线数据，以及ASHES项目中对70微米暗高质量团块的连续谱观测。

Method: 基于ALMA 1.3毫米观测数据，采用角分辨率为1''.6的CO (2-1)、SiO (5-4)和H2CO (3-0,3-2-0,2)分子谱线追踪技术分析年轻原恒星外流的形态和动力学特征。

Result: 在G34.74-0.12中发现了源自9.7太阳质量核心的叉状年轻原恒星外流，其动量、能量和动力学时标分别为13太阳质量·km/s、107太阳质量·km²/s²和约10⁴年，且叉点处SiO、H₂CO和CH₃OH相对丰度增强表明碰撞起源。

Abstract: Outflows are key indicators of ongoing star formation. We report the
discovery of an unanchored forked stream within the propagating path of an
extremely young protostellar outflow in the 70 $\mu$m-dark clump G34.74-0.12,
based on ALMA 1.3 mm observations with an angular resolution of 1''.6 (~ 5000
au). This outflow originate from a 9.7 $M_{\odot}$ core, exhibits a fork-shaped
stream structure in its red-shifted lobe, which is traced by CO (2-1), SiO
(5-4), and H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$-2$_{0,2}$). It has a momentum of 13 $M_{\odot}$
km s$^{-1}$, an energy of 107 $M_{\odot}$ km$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$, and a dynamical
timescale of ~10$^{4}$ yr. Significantly, the enhanced relative abundances of
SiO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH with respect to CO, along with the increased
temperature at the forked point, indicate a collisional origin. The forked
point does not coincide with any dust continuum core > 0.1 $M_{\odot}$.
Moreover, CO (2-1) emission also traces three other outflows in this region,
characterized by their masses (0.40, 0.02 and 0.15 $M_{\odot}$) and momenta
(5.2, 0.2, 1.8 $M_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$), as part of the ALMA Survey of 70
$\mu$m dark High-mass clumps in Early Stages (ASHES) project. All the newly
discovered morphological and kinematic features associated with these extremely
young protostellar outflows (with timescales of 10$^3$ - 10$^4$ years) suggest
that the initial stages of star formation are more complicated than previously
understood.

Result: 发现了多元素丰度相关性及其控制机制的理论解释，并预测了气体和年轻恒星中的相关性程度。

Abstract: Observations of Milky Way stars by multiplexed spectroscopic instruments and
of gas in nearby galaxies using integral field units have made it possible to
measure the abundances of multiple elements in both the interstellar medium and
the stars that form out of it. These observations have revealed complex
correlations between elemental abundances, but thus far there has been no
theoretical framework to interpret these data. In this paper we extend the
simple stochastically-forced diffusion model of Krumholz & Ting (2018), which
has proven successful at explaining the spatial abundance patterns of single
elements, to multiple elements, clarifying why elements are correlated and what
controls their degree of correlation, and making quantitative predictions for
the degree of correlation in both gas and young stars. We show that our results
are qualitatively consistent with observed patterns, and point out how
application of this theory to measured correlations should enable determination
of currently unknown parameters describing r-process nucleosynthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 矮星系主导了所有红移下的星系群体，且多数合并预期发生在它们之间，但矮星系合并对恒星形成的影响尚不明确。

Data: 数据来源于深度光学图像识别的194个矮星系合并后样本和5961个非相互作用矮星系样本，以及GALEX FUV数据用于估算恒星形成率。

Method: 基于GALEX FUV数据估算恒星形成率并计算与对照样本的中位数差异。

Result: 矮矮星系合并后恒星形成率中位数提升0.24 dex（约1.73倍），67%的合并后星系呈现恒星形成增强，33%呈现抑制。

Abstract: Dwarf galaxies dominate the galaxy population across all redshifts, and
majority of mergers are expected to occur between them. However, the impact of
dwarf-dwarf mergers on star formation (SF) is less understood. In this context,
we study SF in 6,155 isolated dwarf galaxies (no massive galaxy, $M_{*} >
10^{10} M_{\odot}$, within 1 Mpc$^3$), including 194 post-mergers and 5,961
non-interacting galaxies, spanning stellar masses of $10^7$ - $10^{9.6}$
M$_{\odot}$ and redshifts of 0.01 - 0.12. Post-mergers sample is from a
previous study, which used deep optical images to identify dwarf galaxies with
merger signatures. Using GALEX FUV data, we estimate star formation rates
(SFRs) and find difference in log(SFR) between a post-merger galaxy and the
median of its corresponding control sample, matched in stellar mass and
redshift. SFR offsets range from -2 to +2 dex, indicating both enhancement and
suppression of SF in our sample with 67% of post-mergers showing enhancement.
The median SFR is found to be elevated by 0.24 dex ($\sim$1.73 times) in
post-mergers, comparable to enhancements seen in massive galaxies. SF is found
to be similarly enhanced in both the central (6" diameter region) and outer
regions of post-mergers with respect to their non-interacting counterparts.
This is in contrast to what is observed in massive galaxies, where the
merger-triggered SF is more significant in the central regions. In the given
small range of redshift, post-merger dwarfs exhibit a higher median specific
SFR compared to their non-interacting counterparts. About 33% of post-mergers
are quenched, possibly reflecting a later stage of the post-merger regime,
where quenching can happen as observed in massive galaxies. This study suggests
that dwarf-dwarf mergers can affect SF in the local universe. A more
comprehensive study of post-merger dwarfs is required to understand their
evolution.

*Lilly A. Kormann,João Alves,Juan D. Soler,Michelangelo Pantaleoni González,Cameren Swiggum,Torsten A. Enßlin,Gordian Edenhofer*

**TL;DR**: 基于《盖亚》3D尘埃图发现太阳系附近存在7条平行巨型丝状超云结构（5条为新发现），其具有恒定倾角（33.5°±4.0°）与窄密度分布（10%变化），为分子云前身并维持环境压力平衡，揭示了银河系大尺度结构对恒星形成的调控机制。

Result: 在银河系局部5千平方秒差距范围内发现了七个高度拉长、大部分平行的超级云结构，其中五个为新发现，这些结构具有33.5±4.0度的倾斜角，质量在10^5至10^6太阳质量之间，且几乎所有已知的太阳邻近恒星形成区都位于超级云内。

Abstract: Recent 3D dust maps of the local Milky Way are revolutionizing our
understanding of the Sun's Galactic neighborhood, bringing much-needed insight
into the large-scale organization of the interstellar medium. Focusing on the
largest scales in $\textit{Gaia}$-based 3D dust maps, we find a pattern of
seven highly elongated, mostly parallel structures in the local
$5\,\mathrm{kpc}^2$, five of which were previously unknown. These structures
show pitch angles of $33.5 \pm 4.0 ^\circ$, and masses ranging from $10^5$ to
$10^6$ $M_\odot$. We refer to these structures as superclouds. Nearly all known
star-forming regions in the solar neighborhood lie within the superclouds,
primarily along their central axes, supporting the idea that they are
precursors to giant molecular clouds. All but one of the seven superclouds show
an underlying undulation, indicating that this is not a property unique to the
Radcliffe wave. We find that while the superclouds have line masses that vary
by about a factor of four, their volume densities vary by about 10$\%$ only.
This suggests that superclouds self-regulate their physical sizes and internal
structure to maintain pressure equilibrium with their environment. These
findings establish a new framework for understanding how large-scale Galactic
structures shape the conditions for star formation in the solar vicinity, and
likely in galaxies like the Milky Way.

Result: 将具有任意径向和横向平均速度但径向速度弥散为零的球对称系统模型简化为三个流体动力学方程，且符合能量守恒定律和位力方程。

Abstract: A spherical system with arbitrary mean velocities in the radial and
transverse directions, but with zero dispersion of radial velocities, is
considered as a model describing the violent relaxation of star clusters and
galaxies. The model allows to reduce the infinite chain of Jeans' equations of
moments to just three hydrodynamic equations. The found system of equations is
consistent with the law of conservation of energy and the virial equation. This
part of the work is devoted to a general description of the model, then the
calculation results will be presented.

Abstract: A majority of JWST/NIRSpec/IFU studies at high redshifts to date have focused
on UV-bright or massive objects, while our understanding of low-mass galaxies
at early cosmic times remains limited. In this work, we present NIRSpec/IFS
high-resolution observations of two low-mass ($M_* < 10^9 \ M_\odot$),
low-metallicity ($[12 + \log(\text{O/H})] < 8$) galaxies at $z \sim 7.66$ with
evidence of hosting AGN. Using spatially-resolved maps of rest-frame optical
emission lines, we find flat metallicity profiles, indicative of ISM
redistribution by outflows or past merging. We identify kinematical components
decoupled from galactic rotation with velocities of $\sim 250 - 500 \ \text{km}
\ \text{s}^{-1}$. We argue that these components are likely tracing outflows,
possibly AGN-driven, for which we infer outflow rates of $\sim 21 - 40 \
M_\odot \ \text{yr}^{-1}$, suggesting they may suppress future star formation.
We compare our observational results to those from the new large-volume
AESOPICA simulations, which fully incorporate different models of black hole
growth and AGN feedback. We find that our observational results of
$v_\text{out}/v_\text{esc}$ and $\dot{M}_\text{out}$/SFR are consistent with
the AGN population in these simulations, hinting that AGN-driven feedback may
contribute to quenching both in our systems and in a wider population of
low-mass galaxies in the early Universe. This novel study demonstrates the
necessity of deep IFU observations to decompose the complex kinematics and
morphology of high-$z$ galaxies, trace outflows, and constrain the effect of
feedback in these low-mass systems.

*Fan Xu,K. C. Freeman,Henry Zovaro*

**TL;DR**: 通过积分视场光谱分析发现银河系类似星系IC 2531的厚盘具有介于银河系化学薄盘与厚盘之间的特性，其厚盘恒星年龄更大、金属丰度更低但α元素丰度相似，为厚盘形成理论提供了新约束。

Background: 研究银河系和其他螺旋星系中薄盘和厚盘的形成历史，特别是厚盘的形成机制。

Data: 使用 ANU 2.3m 望远镜的 WiFeS IFU 摄谱仪获取的观测数据。

Method: 采用积分视场光谱技术结合pPXF拟合Vazdekis模型进行运动学与恒星族分析。

Result: IC 2531的厚盘在恒星族上类似银河系，平均更老、金属丰度更低但α元素丰度相近，但存在一个明显α元素富集的厚盘区域。

Abstract: Thin and thick discs are prominent components in the Milky Way and other
spiral galaxies, but their formation histories are not yet understood, which is
particularly true for thick discs. This is partially due to the fact that we
lack sufficient understanding of thin and thick discs in other galaxies to
determine how common features of the Milky Way's discs are. Here, we conduct an
integral field spectroscopy study of the thin and thick discs in the edge-on
Milky Way analogue IC 2531, using observational data from the WiFeS IFU
spectrograph on the ANU 2.3m telescope. We provide spectral analysis of IC
2531's kinematics and stellar populations in the thin and thick disc regions by
conducting pPXF fitting with Vazdekis models. We found that IC 2531's disc
above the dust plane generally has chemical properties between the Milky Way's
chemical thin and thick disc. IC 2531's thick disc is somewhat similar to the
Milky Way's in terms of stellar populations: on average, it is older, more
metal-poor than its corresponding thin disc, but similarly alpha-enhanced in
general. But we do find a clearly alpha-rich thick disc bin though one of our
"thick disc" bins may be dominated by a warped thin disc. These results may

Background: 研究棒旋星系中恒星运动学结构及其对星系旋转曲线的影响。

Method: 采用N体模拟分析棒旋星系中恒星轨道（如x1类、盒形和盘形轨道）的径向和切向速度随方位角的变化模式。

Result: 棒状星系中棒结构导致恒星径向速度呈锯齿状、切向速度呈拱形分布，并显著降低平均旋转速度，使旋转曲线变浅。

Abstract: We analyze bars formed in $N$-body simulations to investigate two key aspects
of stellar kinematic structure of barred galaxies: the angular distributions of
the radial and azimuthal components of stellar velocities, and the impact of
bars on rotation curves. We find that stars on bar-supporting $x_1$-like orbits
exhibit characteristic sawtooth-like radial velocity patterns and arch-like
tangential velocity patterns as a function of azimuth. In contrast, stars on
box and disk orbits show little azimuthal variation, effectively smoothing the
overall velocity distribution. When averaged over all orbital families, the
resulting kinematics are broadly consistent with the bisymmetric model of
Spekkens & Sellwood, with the amplitudes of bar-induced velocity perturbations
increasing with bar strength. In addition, bars amplify the radial pressure
gradient associated with enhanced random stellar motions, leading to a
noticeable reduction in the mean rotational velocity. This effect becomes more
pronounced with increasing bar strength, resulting in a shallower rotation
curve within the bar region. We discuss our results in the context of the
kinematic properties of observed barred galaxies.

Result: Hα发射线通量集中度与光度加权恒星年龄梯度强相关，且对环境影响敏感，低质量卫星星系偏离主序星形成时通量集中度更高，而大质量盘状中心星系在恒星形成率增强时通量集中度更高，表明大质量星系更频繁发生致密化事件并最终形成显著核球。

Abstract: In this work, we present a study on the H$\alpha$ emission line flux
concentration of 3098 low-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using the MaNGA
data available in the Data Release 17 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We
define the H$\alpha$ flux concentration index ($C_{\rm H\alpha}$) as $C_{\rm
H\alpha}=F_{\rm H\alpha,0.8~R_e}/F_{\rm H\alpha,1.5~R_e}$, where $F_{\rm
H\alpha,0.8~R_e}$ and $F_{\rm H\alpha,1.5~R_e}$ are the cumulative H$\alpha$
flux inside $0.8$ and $1.5$ $r-$band effective radius, respectively. We find
that $C_{\rm H\alpha}$ is strongly correlated with the luminosity weighted
stellar age gradient. $C_{\rm H\alpha}$ is also sensitive to environmental
effects, in the sense that low-mass satellite galaxies below the star formation
main sequence tend to have higher $C_{\rm H\alpha}$. For central galaxies, we
find that massive disk galaxies with enhanced star formation rate tend to have
higher $C_{\rm H\alpha}$, while such a phenomenon is not seen in the low-mass
regime. We interpret this as evidence that compaction events more frequently
occur in the high-mass regime, which eventually resulting in the buildup of
prominent bulges in massive SFGs. Implications of these findings on galaxy
structure formation are discussed.

Result: 所有恒星（包括年龄达110亿年的老恒星）都参与支持旋臂结构，且旋臂强度随恒星年龄增长先降低后趋于稳定，同时不同年龄恒星对旋臂扭矩的贡献随时间变化。

Abstract: Context. The origin and nature of spiral arms remain unclear. Star forming
regions and young stars are generally strongly associated to the spiral
structure, but there are few quantitative predictions from simulations about
the involvement of stars of different ages. Aims. We aim to quantify the
interplay between spiral arms and different populations. Methods. We use a
hydrodynamical simulation of an isolated disc galaxy displaying a dynamic
multi-armed spiral structure. Inspired by cosmological structure metrics, we
develop a new method, the local dimension, that robustly delineates arms across
populations and through space and time. Results. We find that all stars,
including those as old as 11Gyr, support the arms. The spiral strength
decreases with stellar age up to 2Gyr-old stars and remains nearly constant for
older stars. However, the scaling between arm strength and age (or velocity
dispersion) depends on the strength of the global spiral structure at each
time. Almost all stars formed in arms remain within them for no more than
140-180Myr, whereas old stars leave arms about three times faster. Even if the
youngest populations dominate in the production of the spiral torques at early
times, all populations contribute equally at later times. Conclusions. Our
results highlight the power of the local dimension for studying complex spiral
structures and show that all stellar populations in the disc partake in the
arms. Since in our model we see spiral arms in populations with velocity
dispersions up to 90km/s, which are comparable to those of the Milky Way, we
predict that old Galactic populations could also exhibit spiral structure.

### [15] [Inclination Effect on Observational Identification of Outflow Rotation in Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15535)

**TL;DR**: 通过磁流体动力学模拟和合成观测发现，原恒星外流的旋转特征在倾角大于85度时清晰可见，但倾角低于70-80度时旋转特征会被掩盖，导致大部分外流旋转未被观测到。

Method: 采用磁流体动力学模拟结合辐射转移和合成观测技术分析原恒星系统外流旋转特征。

Result: 旋转特征在约2/3至4/5的喷流群体（倾角小于70-80度）中可能被掩盖。

Abstract: We investigate the observational signatures of outflow rotation in
protostellar systems using magnetohydrodynamics simulations of protostellar
evolution with radiative transfer and synthetic observation. The velocity
gradient perpendicular to the outflow axis indicates outflow rotation. The
rotation signature is clearly seen in the moment 1 map and a position-velocity
(PV) diagram across an outflow lobe made from our model with an inclination
angle of i>~85{degree sign}, as in observational studies of protostellar
outflows. Velocity projection with lower inclinations distorts the moment 1 map
because the outflow vertical (propagation) velocity contributes more to the
line-of-sight velocity, leading to an incorrect outflow axis direction. The PV
diagram adopting the incorrect outflow axis shows no clear velocity gradient.
These effects may prevent us from identifying outflow rotation. Our analysis
implies that rotational signatures can be obscured in ~2/3 to ~4/5 of the total
outflow population (i<70{degree sign}-80{degree sign}), regardless of the
evolutionary stage. Complicated structures in observed outflows make it
difficult to determine the outflow, which may result in the apparent
non-detection of outflow rotation.

Background: 研究星系群和星系团等宇宙学高密度环境中环境效应对星系及其冷气体储层的影响，以约束星系演化模型。

Data: 数据来源于MeerKAT的HI观测数据、Dark Energy Survey（DES）的亚角秒光学成像数据、Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer（WISE）的红外数据以及SIMBA模拟数据。

Method: 利用MeerKAT的HI观测数据结合DES和WISE多波段数据量化成员星系性质，并采用SIMBA模拟对比分析HI超密度结构的形态特征与发现频率。

Result: 在z~0.04处发现了一个富含相互作用的HI星系大尺度超密度结构，揭示了环境过程正在塑造星系性质。

Abstract: Environmental effects within cosmological overdensities, such as galaxy
groups and clusters, have been shown to impact galaxies and their cold gas
reservoirs and thereby provide constraints on galaxy evolution models. Galaxy
groups foster frequent galaxy-galaxy interactions, making them rich
environments in which to study galaxy transformation. In this work, we study a
serendipitously discovered large overdensity of HI galaxies at z~0.04. The
galaxies appear to lie in a filamentary-like structure of megaparsec scale.
MeerKAT's angular resolution and field of view allow us to spatially resolve
the HI galaxies while simultaneously probing large-scale structure. The HI and
sub-arcsec Dark Energy Survey (DES) imaging reveal a large number of
interacting galaxies in this collective group. MeerKAT data enables us to
derive HI masses and investigate interacting galaxies. We use DES and
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data to quantify the star formation
rates, stellar masses, and stellar morphologies of member galaxies and compare
these with field scaling relations. To place this discovery and the
environmental effects in context, we use the SIMBA simulation to investigate
the prevalence of qualitatively similar HI overdensities and their large-scale
morphological properties. This enables a prediction of how frequently such
structures might be serendipitously discovered with MeerKAT and SKA-Mid HI
observations in comparable observation time. The combination of spatially
resolved HI data and optical imaging reveals a group rich in interactions,
suggesting environmental processes are already shaping galaxy properties within
the structure. More of these serendipitous discoveries are expected and,
alongside ongoing targeted programmes, these will provide a rich sample to
study galaxy transformation and enable a MeerKAT HI perspective on large-scale
structure, including filaments.

Background: 研究银河系贫金属盘的起源和演化，揭示其包含原始盘和不同α丰度盘的金属丰度下限低于以往认知。

Data: 数据来源于LAMOST巡天项目中的约10万颗贫金属恒星样本。

Method: 采用化学动力学分析方法识别银河系贫金属盘中的主要星族和子结构。

Result: 发现银河系贫金属盘包含四个主要星群：一个年龄超过120亿年的原始盘、来自GSE前身星系的碎片恒星、高α盘和低α盘的贫金属尾，并识别出三个新子结构。

Abstract: In our previous work, we identified $\sim100,000$ metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]
$<$ -1.0) from the LAMOST Survey. This work estimates their chemical abundances
and explores the origin and evolution of the Galactic metal-poor disc. Our
chemo-dynamical analysis reveals four main populations within the metal-poor
disc: (1) a primordial disc older than 12 Gyr with [Fe/H] $>$ -1.5; (2) debris
stars from the progenitor galaxy of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), but now
residing in the Galactic disc; (3) the metal-poor tail of the metal-rich,
high-$\alpha$ disc formed 10-12 Gyr ago, with metallicity lower limit extending
to -2.0; (4) the metal-poor tail of the metal-rich, low-$\alpha$ disc younger
than 8 Gyr, reaching a lower metallicity limit of -1.8. These results reveal
the presence of a primordial disc and show that both high-$\alpha$ and
low-$\alpha$ discs reach lower metallicities than previously thought. Analysis
of merger debris reveals that Wukong, with extremely low metallicity, likely
originate from merger events distinct from GSE. Additionally, three new
substructures are identified: ShangGu-1, characterized by unusual
[Fe/H]-eccentricity correlations; ShangGu-2, possibly heated disc stars; and
ShangGu-3, which can be divided into four subgroups based on differing orbital
directions, with two aligning with the previously known Nyx and Nyx-2.

Result: 发现SDSO1是由共生白矮星双星EG Andromedae抛出的古老、高速移动的幽灵行星状星云（GPN）激波驱动的弓形激波结构，而非与M31相关。

Abstract: We present new, deep narrow band imagery and discuss the nature of SDSO1, the
large [O III]-emitting nebula centered 1.5 degrees SE of M31. We find strong
evidence to support the hypothesis that SDSO1 is unrelated to M31 and is
instead a bow shock driven by a faded, giant (D = 20 pc), 400 kyr-old, ghost
planetary nebula (GPN) expelled by the symbiotic WD binary star EG Andromedae.
Because EG And lags the rotation of the Milky Way, its hypersonic velocity of
107 km/s drives a shock into the local interstellar medium. SDSO1 also sports a
45-pc long turbulent tail that crosses M31. We establish the shock-powered GPN
phase as a new phase of PN evolution, and identify seven more candidate GPNe by
their large size and shock-tail morphology. This includes several giant halos
of younger planetary nebulae, possibly expelled by now degenerate binary
companions. The interaction of an old, fast-moving GPN with the ISM generates a
shock that remains visible long after the photoionized PN shell has faded below
the limit of detectability. The SDSO1 GPN has reached a phase in its evolution
where its outward expansion has been slowed considerably by the work it has
done on the interstellar medium. Once the GPN outflow expends the rest of its
kinetic energy, it will be stripped from EG And and mix into the surrounding
ISM.

Abstract: We present the joint modelling of weak-lensing and count measurements of the
galaxy clusters detected with the AMICO code, in the fourth data release of the
Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-1000). The analysed sample comprises about 8000
clusters, covering an effective area of 839 deg$^{2}$ and extending up to a
redshift of $z = 0.8$. Stacked cluster weak-lensing and count measurements have
been derived in bins of redshift and intrinsic richness, $\lambda^*$. Based on
self-organising maps, we reconstructed the true redshift distributions of the
background galaxy samples. We accounted for the systematic uncertainties
arising from impurities in the background and cluster samples, biases in the
cluster $z$ and $\lambda^*$, projection effects, halo orientation and
miscentring, truncation of cluster halo mass distributions, matter correlated
with cluster haloes, multiplicative shear bias, baryonic matter, geometric
distortions in the lensing profiles, uncertainties in the theoretical halo mass
function, and super-sample covariance. We also employed a blinding strategy
based on perturbing the cluster sample completeness. The improved statistics
and photometry compared to the previous KiDS data release, KiDS-DR3, have led
to a halving of the uncertainties on $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$, as we
obtained $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.22\pm0.02$ and $\sigma_8=0.86\pm0.03$. The
constraint on $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5}$,
$S_8=0.74\pm0.03$, is in excellent agreement with recent cluster count and
KiDS-1000 cosmic shear analyses, while it shows a $2.8\sigma$ tension with
Planck cosmic microwave background results. The constraints on the
$\log\lambda^*-\log M_{200}$ relation imply a mass precision of 8%, on average.
In addition, the result on the intrinsic scatter of the $\log\lambda^*-\log
M_{200}$ relation, $\sigma_{\rm intr}=0.05\pm0.02$, confirms that $\lambda^*$
is an excellent mass proxy.

Abstract: Context. Galaxy clusters provide key insights into cosmic structure

We present a catalog of galaxy clusters detected in the Kilo-Degree Survey
(KiDS-DR4) optimized for cosmological analyses and investigations of cluster
properties. Each detection includes probabilistic membership assignments for
the KiDS-DR4 galaxies within the magnitude range 15<r'<24. Methods. Using the
Adaptive Matched Identifier of Clustered Objects (AMICO) algorithm, we
identified 23965 clusters over an effective area of about 839 deg2 in the
redshift range $0.1\le z \le0.9$, with a signal-to-noise ratio $S/N>3.5$. The
sample is highly homogeneous across the entire survey thanks to the restrictive
galaxy selection criteria we adopted. Spectroscopic data from the GAMA survey
were used to calibrate the clusters photometric redshift and assess their
uncertainties. We introduced algorithmic enhancements to AMICO to mitigate
border effects among neighbor tiles. Quality flags are also provided for each
cluster detection. The sample purity and completeness assessments have been
estimated using the SinFoniA data driven approach, thus avoiding strong
assumptions embedded in numerical simulations. We introduced a blinding scheme
of the selection function meant to support the cosmological analyses. Results.
Our cluster sample includes 321 cross-matches with the X-ray eRASS1 "primary"
sample and 235 matches with the ACT-DR5 cluster sample. We derived a mass-proxy
scaling relation based on intrinsic richness, $\lambda_*$, using masses from
the eRASS1 catalog. Conclusions. The KiDS-DR4 cluster catalog provides a
valuable data set for investigating galaxy cluster properties and contributes
to cosmological studies by offering a large, well-characterized cluster sample.

Abstract: We present an optimised multipole algorithm for computing the three-point
correlation function (3PCF), tailored for application to large-scale
cosmological datasets. The algorithm builds on a $in\, situ$ interpretation of
correlation functions, wherein spatial displacements are implemented via
translation window functions. In Fourier space, these translations correspond
to plane waves, whose decomposition into spherical harmonics naturally leads to
a multipole expansion framework for the 3PCF. To accelerate computation, we
incorporate density field reconstruction within the framework of
multiresolution analysis, enabling efficient summation using either grid-based
or particle-based schemes. In addition to the shared computational cost of
reconstructing the multipole-decomposed density fields - scaling as
$\mathcal{O}(L^2_{\text{trun}} N_g \log N_g)$ (where $N_g$ is the number of
grids and $L_{\text{trun}}$ is the truncation order of the multipole expansion)
- the final summation step achieves a complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(D^6_{\text{sup}} N_g)$ for the grid-based approach and
$\mathcal{O}(D^3_{\text{sup}} N_p)$ for the particle-based scheme (where
$D_{\text{sup}}$ is the support of the basis function and $N_p$ is the number
of particles). The proposed $in\, situ$ multipole algorithm is fully
GPU-accelerated and implemented in the open-source $Hermes$ toolkit for cosmic
statistics. This development enables fast, scalable higher-order clustering
analyses for large-volume datasets from current and upcoming cosmological
surveys such as Euclid, DESI, LSST, and CSST.

Abstract: The evolution of the supermassive Black Hole (BH) population across cosmic
times remains a central unresolved issue in modern astrophysics, due to the
many noticeable uncertainties in the involved physical processes. Here we
tackle the problem via a semi-empirical approach with minimal assumptions and
data-driven inputs. This is firmly grounded on a continuity plus Smoluchowski
equation framework that allows to unitarily describe the two primary modes of
BH growth: gas accretion and binary mergers. Key quantities related to the
latter processes are incorporated through educated parameterizations, and then
constrained in a Bayesian setup from joint observational estimates of the local
BH mass function, of the large-scale BH clustering, and of the nano-Hz
stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background measured from Pulsar Timimg Array
(PTA) experiments. We find that the BH accretion-related parameters are
strongly dependent on the local BH mass function determination: higher
normalizations and flatter high-mass slopes in the latter imply lower radiative
efficiencies and mean Eddington ratios with a stronger redshift evolution.
Additionally, the binary BH merger rate is estimated to be a fraction $\lesssim
10^{-1}$ of the galaxy merger rate derived from galaxy pairs counts by JWST,
and constrained not to exceed the latter at $\gtrsim 2\sigma$. Relatedly, we
highlight hints of a possible tension between current constraints on BH
demographics and the interpretation of the nano-Hz GW background as
predominantly caused by binary BH mergers. Specifically, we bound the latter's
contribution to $\lesssim 30-50\%$ at $\sim 3\sigma$, suggesting that either
systematics in the datasets considered here have been underestimated so far, or
that additional astrophysical/cosmological sources are needed to explain the
residual part of the signal measured by PTA experiments.

Background: 探讨了带有拐点的暴胀势如何导致永恒暴胀及其对原初黑洞模型和大尺度结构观测的影响。

Data: 使用文献中的示例模型进行测试，并通过线性与二次区域的模型参数表达Fokker-Planck方程的最低特征值λ₁。

Method: 采用Fokker-Planck方程特征值分析及慢滚参数条件判定永恒暴胀。

Result: 在拐点原初黑洞模型中，永恒暴胀难以避免，且若采用体积权重，这些模型与大尺度结构观测不相容。

Abstract: Inflation with an inflection point potential is a popular model for producing
primordial black holes. The potential near the inflection point is
approximately flat, with a local maximum next to a local minimum, prone to
eternal inflation. We show that a sufficient condition for eternal inflation is
$\lambda_1 \leq 3$, where $\lambda_1$ is the index of the `exponential tail,'
the lowest eigenvalue of the Fokker--Planck equation over a bounded region. We
write $\lambda_1$ in terms of the model parameters for linear and quadratic
regions. Wide quadratic regions inflate eternally if the second slow-roll
parameter $\eta_V \geq -6$. We test example models from the literature and show
this condition is satisfied; we argue eternal inflation is difficult to avoid
in inflection point PBH models. Eternally inflating regions correspond to type
II perturbations and form baby universes, hidden behind black hole horizons.
These baby universes are inhomogeneous on large scales and dominate the
multiverse's total volume. We argue that, if volume weighting is used, eternal
inflation makes inflection point primordial black hole models incompatible with
large-scale structure observations.

**TL;DR**: 研究发现暗物质通过绝热创生过程可解释宇宙加速膨胀，两种创生率模型均能模拟ΛCDM行为，其中模型一与ΛCDM统计等效，模型二在DESI数据支持下优于ΛCDM。


<details>

Background: 探索宇宙物质创生情景作为暗能量和修正引力理论的替代方案。

Data: 使用了包括宇宙计时器（CC）、Ia型超新星（SNIa）（Pantheon+、DESY5和Union3样本）和DESI重子声波振荡（BAO）（DR1和DR2样本）在内的最新观测数据集。

Method: 采用动力学系统分析和最新观测数据（CC、SNIa、DESY5、Union3、DESI BAO）进行详细观测对比。

Result: 通过最新观测数据发现，两种物质创生模型均能模拟ΛCDM行为，且Model I与ΛCDM统计等价，而Model II在纳入DESI数据时优于ΛCDM。

Abstract: We investigate the cosmological matter creation scenario, an alternative
approach to both dark energy and modified gravity theories, after the recent
DESI DR2-BAO release. We consider that the total matter sector consists of
three independently evolving components, namely, radiation, baryons, and dark
matter, with the latter being governed by an adiabatic matter creation process
that leads to a modified continuity equation. Due to the violation of the
standard conservation law, a creation pressure appears, and under a proper
choice of dark-matter particle creation rate one can obtain the present
accelerating phase as well as the past thermal history of the Universe. We
study two specific matter creation rates. By applying the dynamical-system
analysis we show that both Model I and Model II can mimic a $\Lambda$CDM-like
behavior. Furthermore, we perform a detailed observational confrontation using
a series of latest observational datasets including Cosmic Chronometers (CC),
Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) (Pantheon+, DESY5 and Union3 samples) and DESI Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) (DR1 and DR2 samples). In both Model I and Model II
we find evidence of matter creation at many standard deviations. Finally,
applying the AIC and BIC information criteria we find that Model I is
statistically equivalent with $\Lambda$CDM scenario, while Model II shows a
mixed picture, namely for most datasets $\Lambda$CDM scenario is favoured,
however when DESI data are included matter creation Model II is favoured over
$\Lambda$CDM paradigm.

*Chen Yuan,Zu-Cheng Chen,Lang Liu*

**TL;DR**: 发现GW231123引力波事件可能源于早期物质主导时期形成的原初黑洞，其参数可解释观测特性且与现有限制一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 探讨GW231123引力波事件可能源自早期物质主导时期形成的原初黑洞。

Data: 数据来源于对GW231123引力波事件的观测，包括其组分质量M1=137+22−17M⊙、M2=103+20−52M⊙以及局部合并率Rlocal=0.08+0.19−0.07Gpc−3yr−1。

Method: 采用原始黑洞质量函数、丰度、自旋分布及并合率密度计算的方法。

Result: GW231123可能源自早期物质主导时期形成的原初黑洞，其参数选择可复现该事件关键特性，且原初黑洞丰度与现有限制边界一致。

Abstract: We investigate the possibility that the recently reported GW231123 event,
with component masses $M_1=137^{+22}_{-17}\,M_\odot$,
$M_2=103^{+20}_{-52}\,M_\odot$ and a local merger rate
$R_{\mathrm{local}}=0.08^{+0.19}_{-0.07}\,\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$,
originates from primordial black holes (PBHs) formed during an early
matter-dominated era. We compute the PBH mass function, abundance, spin
distribution and the merger rate density and find a set of choices for the
parameters to reproduce the key properties of GW231123. We also show that the
resulting PBH abundance, $f_{\mathrm{pbh}}= 1.64^{+5.00}_{-1.59}\times10^{-1}$,
is at the border of the exclusion regions, but still remains self-consistent.
Finally, we estimate the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) that are
inevitably generated during PBH formation. PBHs that interpret GW231123 are
accompanied by negligible SIGWs in the nano-hertz band, indicating no conflict
with current pulsar timing arrays data.

**TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于三维FFT模拟微波背景辐射部分天区的高效方法，适用于介于全天区和平坦天区之间的观测范围。


<details>

Background: 研究微波背景辐射（CMB）模拟方法在介于全天区和平坦天空近似之间的观测区域的效率优化问题。

Data: 使用快速傅里叶变换在三维盒中生成模拟数据，再采样到天球观测区域。

Method: 采用三维盒子中的快速傅里叶变换模拟微波背景辐射图并采样到天球观测区域。

Result: 提出了一种基于三维FFT模拟部分天区微波背景辐射的高效方法。

Abstract: Simulated maps of the microwave background (CMB) radiation are generally
created using one of two methods: all-sky simulations use the spherical
harmonic transform, while maps covering small areas approximate the sky as
flat, allowing the use of fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). Current and
near-future experiments, particularly ones like CMB S4, will cover areas too
large for the flat-sky approximation but significantly less than the full sky.
In this regime, it can be more efficient to simulate maps in a 3-D box using
FFTs, and then sample onto the observed part of the celestial sphere. We
present a method for performing such simulations and show that it can be more
efficient than full-sky simulations. We develop the method for scalar maps, but
we expect it to be applicable to higher-spin (e.g., polarization) simulations
as well.

Result: 通过传递函数描述脉冲星计时残差傅里叶分量间的相关性，揭示了有限时间窗口内随机引力波背景信号的时域关联特征。

Abstract: We revisit the theoretical modeling and simulation of a Gaussian stochastic
gravitational wave background (SGWB) signal in a pulsar timing array (PTA). We
show that the correlation between Fourier components of pulsar timing residuals
can be expressed using transfer functions; that are indicative of
characteristic temporal correlations in a SGWB signal observed in a finite time
window. These transfer functions, when convolved with the SGWB power spectrum
and spatial correlation (Hellings \& Downs curve), describe the variances and
correlations of the pulsar timing residuals' Fourier coefficients. The
convolutions are the exact frequency- and Fourier-domain representations of the
time-domain covariance function. We derive explicit forms for the transfer
functions for unpolarized and circularly polarized SGWB signals. We validate
our results by comparing Gaussian theoretical expectation values with standard
simulations based on point sources and our own covariance-matrix-based
approach. The unified frequency- and Fourier-domain formalism provides a robust
foundation for future PTA precision analyses and highlights the importance of
temporal correlations in interpreting GW signals.

Abstract: The Euclid mission of the European Space Agency will deliver galaxy and
cosmic shear surveys, which will be used to constrain initial conditions and
statistics of primordial fluctuations. We present highlights for the Euclid
scientific capability to test initial conditions beyond LCDM with the main
probes, i.e. 3D galaxy clustering from the spectroscopic survey, the
tomographic approach to 3x2pt statistics from photometric galaxy survey, and
their combination. We provide Fisher forecasts from the combination of Euclid
spectroscopic and photometric surveys for spatial curvature, running of the
spectral index of the power spectrum of curvature perturbations, isocurvature
perturbations, and primordial features. For the parameters of these models we
also provide the combination of Euclid forecasts (pessimistic and optimistic)
with current and future measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
anisotropies., i.e. Planck, the Simons Observatory (SO), and CMB-S4. We provide
Fisher forecasts for how the power spectrum and bispectrum from the Euclid
spectroscopic survey will constrain the local, equilateral, and orthogonal
shapes of primordial non-Gaussianity. We also review how Bayesian field-level
inference of primordial non-Gaussianity can constrain local primordial
non-Gaussianity. We show how Euclid, with its unique combination of the main
probes, will provide the tightest constraints on low redshift to date. By
targeting a markedly different range in redshift and scale, Euclid's expected
uncertainties are complementary to those obtained by CMB primary anisotropy,
returning the tightest combined constraints on the physics of the early
Universe.

Abstract: The intracluster medium (ICM), composed of hot plasma, dominates the baryonic
content of galaxy clusters and is primarily observable in X-rays. Its
thermodynamic properties, pressure, temperature, entropy, and electron density,
offer crucial insight into the physical processes shaping clusters, from
accretion and mergers to radiative cooling and feedback. We investigate the
thermodynamic properties of galaxy clusters in the Simulating the LOcal Web
(SLOW) constrained simulations, which reproduce the observed large-scale
structure of the local Universe. We assess how well these simulations reproduce
observed ICM profiles and explore the connection between cluster formation
history and core classification. Three-dimensional thermodynamic profiles are
extracted and compared to deprojected X-ray and Sunyaev - Zel'dovich (SZ) data
for local clusters classified as solid cool-core (SCC), weakly cool-core (WCC),
and non-cool-core (NCC) systems. We also examine the mass assembly history of
the simulated counterparts to link their formation to present-day ICM
properties. The simulations reproduce global thermodynamic profiles for
clusters such as Perseus, Coma, A85, A119, A1644, A2029, A3158, and A3266.
Moreover, they show that CC clusters typically assemble their mass earlier,
while NCC systems grow through more extended, late-time merger-driven
histories. WCC clusters show intermediate behavior, suggesting an evolutionary
transition. Our results demonstrate that constrained simulations provide a
powerful tool for linking cluster formation history to present-day ICM
properties and point to possible refinements in subgrid physics as well as in
resolution that could improve the agreement in cluster core regions.

Abstract: We present AstroWISP: a collection of image processing tools for source
extraction, background determination, point spread function/pixel response
function fitting, and aperture photometry. AstroWISP is particularly
well-suited for working with detectors featuring a Bayer mask (an array of
microfilters applied to each detector pixel to allow color photography), such
as consumer DSLR cameras. Such detectors pose significant challenges for
existing tools while offering a much cheaper alternative to specialized
devices. As a result, consumer DSLR cameras with Bayer masks are often
underutilized for precision photometry. \astrowisp{} addresses this limitation
in an effort to democratize precision photometry and support broader community
participation in research. We demonstrate that our tools produce high-precision
photometry from such images, enabling the use of such devices for detecting
exoplanet transits. We package our tools for all major operating systems to
ensure accessibility for amateur astronomers.

Abstract: High-mass stars are notable for several reasons: they are characterized by
strong winds, which inject momentum and enriched material into their
surroundings, and die spectacularly as supernovae, leaving behind compact
remnants and heavy elements (such as those that make life on Earth possible).
Despite their relative rarity, they play a disproportionate role in the
evolution of the galaxies that host them, and likely also played a significant
role in the early days of the Universe. A subset ($\sim$10\%) of these stars
was also found to host magnetic fields on their surface. These fields impact
their evolution, and may lead to exotic physics (e.g., heavy stellar-mass black
holes, pair-instability supernovae, magnetars, etc.). However, the detection
and measurement of magnetic fields is limited, due to current instrumentation,
to nearby massive stars in the Milky Way. To truly understand how magnetism
arises in massive stars, and what role it might have played in earlier stages
of our Universe, we require next-generation hardware, such as the proposed
near-infrared-to-ultraviolet spectropolarimeter Pollux, on the Habitable Worlds
Observatory (HWO). In this contribution, we detail how Pollux @ HWO will enable
new frontiers in the study of magnetic massive stars, delivering results that
will profoundly impact the fields of stellar formation, stellar evolution,
compact objects, and stellar feedback.

Abstract: Human activities degrade the Earth environment at an unprecedented scale and
pace, threatening Earth-system stability, resilience and life-support
functions. We can of course deny the facts, get angry about them, try to
bargain, or fall into deep depression. Or we may overcome these stages of grief
and move towards accepting that human activities need to change, including our
own ones. The purpose of this paper is to support astronomers in this
transition, by providing insights into the origins of environmental impacts in
astronomical research and proposing changes that would make the field
sustainable. The paper focuses on the environmental impacts of research
infrastructures, since these are the dominant sources of greenhouse gas
emissions in astronomy, acknowledging that impact reductions in other areas,
for example professional air travelling, need also to be achieved.

Abstract: Context. Molecular hydrogen and its cation H+2 are among the first species
formed in the early Universe, and play a key role in the thermal and chemical
evolution of the primordial gas. In molecular clouds, H+2 ions formed through
ionization of H2 by particles react rapidly with H2 to form H+3 , triggering
the formation of almost all detected interstellar molecules. Aims. We present a
new set of cross sections and rate coefficients for state-to-state
ro-vibrational transitions of the H+2 and HD+ ions, induced by low-energy
electron collisions. Study includes the major electron-impact processes
relevant for low-metallicity astrochemistry: inelastic and superelastic

processes involving H+2 and HD+ are treated using the multichannel quantum

Background: 探讨太空时代初期军事活动与天文观测之间的冲突及其对国际太空治理的影响。

Method: 采用历史比较分析方法探讨西福特计划与大型卫星星座对天文研究的影响。

Result: Project West Ford 促使天文学家采取行动并影响了《外层空间条约》的制定。

Abstract: The dawning of the Space Age marked the start of an ongoing relationship
between the professional astronomical community and both state and non-state
actors that launch and operate spacecraft in near-Earth orbital space. While
the Cold War heated up in the late 1950s, military uses of outer space quickly
came into conflict with the priorities of astronomers then building ever-bigger
ground-based telescopes and envisioning the first generation of space
telescopes. As the threat of global thermonuclear war loomed, the United States
carried out Project West Ford, which tested an 'artificial ionosphere' for
microwave radio propagation by placing several hundred million tiny copper
dipoles into a belt orbiting the Earth. While the test was ultimately
successful, it ignited a firestorm of concern and criticism among astronomers
and ultimately influenced the framing of the United Nations Outer Space Treaty.
Here we examine the history of Project West Ford as it prompted astronomers to
react, comparing it with the ongoing problem of the potential impact of large
satellite constellations on astronomical research.

Background: 探索标准模型之外的稀有新物理现象（如暗物质粒子散射或无中微子双β衰变）是当前低本底物理的核心目标。

Data: 使用Geant4模拟工具包中的电磁相互作用物理构造函数，基于常见的放射性污染物（α、β、γ粒子）在CaWO4和Ge靶材中的能量沉积进行测试。

Method: 采用Geant4工具包中的物理构造函数模拟电磁相互作用，量化不同模型对探测器内总能量沉积的影响。

Result: Geant4模拟中物理构造器的选择对CaWO4和Ge探测器内总能量沉积有显著影响。

Abstract: A primary objective in contemporary low background physics is the search for
rare and novel phenomena beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, e.g.
the scattering off of a potential Dark Matter particle or the neutrinoless
double beta decay. The success of such searches depends on a reliable
background prediction via Monte Carlo simulations. A widely used toolkit to
construct these simulations is Geant4, which offers the user a wide choice of
how to model the physics of particle interactions. For example, for
electromagnetic interactions, Geant4 provides pre-defined sets of models:
physics constructors. As decay products of radioactive contaminants contribute
to the background mainly via electromagnetic interactions, the physics
constructor used in a Geant4 simulation may have an impact on the total energy
deposition inside the detector target. To facilitate the selection of physics
constructors for simulations of experiments that are using CaWO$_\mathrm{4}$
and Ge targets, we quantify their impact on the total energy deposition for
several test cases. These cases consist of radioactive contaminants commonly
encountered, covering energy depositions via $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$
particles, as well as two examples for the target thickness: thin and bulky. We
also consider the computing performance of the studied physics constructors.

**TL;DR**: 提出深度学习框架Frabjous，结合模拟与真实数据训练FRB形态分类器，在五类平衡数据上实现55%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 快速射电暴（FRBs）的探测数量激增，亟需自动化分类以优化有限的多波段观测资源分配。

Data: 使用CHIME/FRB目录中的真实数据结合模拟生成的FRB样本构建训练集。

Method: 采用深度学习框架结合模拟和真实数据训练自动形态分类器。

Result: 开发了一种名为Frabjous的深度学习框架，用于快速自动分类快速射电暴形态，结合模拟和真实数据训练后分类准确率达55%，显著高于随机分类的20%。

Abstract: The increasing field of view of radio telescopes and improved data processing
capabilities have led to a surge in the detection of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs).
The discovery rate of FRBs is already a few per day and is expected to increase
rapidly with new surveys coming online. The growing number of events
necessitates prioritized follow-up due to limited multi-wavelength resources,
requiring rapid and automated classification. In this study, we introduce
Frabjous, a deep learning framework for an automated morphology classifier with
an aim towards enabling the prompt follow-up of anomalous and intriguing FRBs,
and a comprehensive statistical analysis of FRB morphologies. Deep learning
models require a large training set of each FRB archetype, however, publicly
available data lacks sufficient samples for most FRB types. In this paper, we
build a simulation framework for generating realistic examples of FRBs and
train a network based on a combination of simulated and real data, starting
with the CHIME/FRB catalog. Applying our framework to the first CHIME/FRB
catalog, we achieve an overall classification accuracy of approximately 55%,
well over a random multiclass classification rate of 20 % with five balanced
classes during training. While this falls short of desirable performance, we
critically discuss the limitations of our approach and propose potential
avenues for improvement. Future work should explore strategies to augment
training datasets and broaden the scope of FRB morphological studies, aiming
for more accurate and reliable classification results.

Abstract: As part of Saudi Arabia Vision 2030 and under the guidance of the Royal
Commission for AlUla (RCU), efforts are underway to establish AlUla Manara as
the Kingdom first major astronomical observatory. This study presents a
preliminary assessment of the site based on ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis data to
evaluate its suitability for hosting a 4m-class optical-IR telescope. AlUla
Manara is located on a remote plateau 74 km north of the historical town of
AlUla and was recently designated as an International Dark Sky Park. The
analysis focuses on key astro-meteorological parameters such as seeing,
temperature regimes, wind patterns, cloud cover and precipitable water vapor
(PWV). Results show a median nighttime seeing of 1.5 arcsec, a median cold
season PWV of 3.2 mm, and over 79% of nighttime hours with clear sky
conditions. Wind regimes are generally mild, posing no constraints on
infrastructure. The analysis includes three further sites in the Kingdom,
namely Volcanic Top, Ward Mountain, and Dubba Mountain. These sites exhibit
better turbulence conditions, but are located outside RCU jurisdiction.
Nevertheless, AlUla Manara remains a competitive candidate thanks to its
alignment with broader regional development goals. To validate these
preliminary results, a dedicated Astronomical Site Monitor has been deployed on
site to support the design and operational planning of the observatory.

Abstract: The detection of the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) is one
of the most challenging tasks for both current and next-generation detectors.
Successfully distinguishing the SGWB from instrumental noise and environmental
effects requires accurate and flexible analysis tools capable of detecting the
signal and determining its origin. In this paper, we introduce a unified
framework and a user-friendly tool for SGWB characterization: \texttt{GWBird}
(Gravitational Wave Background Inventory of Response functions for Detectors).
This code enables the computation of overlap reduction functions (ORFs),
power-law integrated sensitivity curves (PLS), angular response functions, and
angular PLS (APLS). It supports the full range of gravitational wave
polarization modes (tensor, scalar, and vector), allowing for the
characterization of both isotropic and anisotropic SGWB components for all the
polarizations. Additionally, the code includes functions for circular
polarization characterization, which is particularly relevant for probing
parity-violating signals. The framework integrates analyses for ground-based,
space-based, and Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) detectors, offering a versatile
framework for SGWB analysis. The \texttt{GWBird} code is publicly available

Result: 提出了一种基于SQQ的自适应辛积分器SQQ-PTQ，通过切比雪夫插值和投影方法提高了精度与计算效率，并采用拟牛顿法加速非线性方程求解，在长期积分中保持了能量守恒特性。

Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive symplectic integrator, SQQ-PTQ, developed on
the basis of the fixed-step symplectic integrator SQQ. To mitigate the Runge
phenomenon, SQQ-PTQ employs Chebyshev interpolation for approximating the
action, enhancing both the precision and stability of the interpolation. In
addition, to reduce the computational cost of evaluating interpolation
functions, SQQ-PTQ introduces a projection method that improves the efficiency
of these computations. A key feature of SQQ-PTQ is its use of the time
transformation to implement an adaptive time step. To address the challenge of
computing complicated Jacobian matrices attributed to the time transformation,
SQQ-PTQ adopts a quasi-Newton method based on Broyden's method. This strategy
accelerates the solution of nonlinear equations, thereby improving the overall
computational performance. The effectiveness and robustness of SQQ-PTQ are
demonstrated via three numerical experiments. In particular, SQQ-PTQ
demonstrates adaptability in handling close-encounter problems. Moreover,
during long-term integrations, SQQ-PTQ maintains the energy conservation,
further confirming its advantages as a symplectic algorithm.

Abstract: A method is presented to use a fiber-optic device known as a photonic lantern
to generate a reconfigurable custom wavefront for a null test of spherical,
aspheric, and freeform optical surfaces. By modulating input intensity and
phases at single mode fiber input ports, the wavefront of the output light
field from the multimode end can be controlled to generate a custom nulling
phase function. Generation of a desired wavefront is demonstrated by simulating
a nineteen-port non-mode-selective photonic lantern. Using a linear
response-matrix approach, a phase function with an RMS error of 44 nm from the
target was generated in simulation. A compact form-factor noninterferometric
null test for freeform optical surfaces is then described utilizing the
photonic lantern as both a reconfigurable nulling source and a wavefront
sensor.

Abstract: Carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are significant contributors of
carbonaceous dust to the galactic environment, however the mechanisms and
conditions for formation and subsequent evolution of dust around these stars
remain open questions. Here we present JWST observations of the WR+WR
colliding-wind binary Apep which reveal an intricate series of nested
concentric dust shells that are abundant in detailed substructure. The striking
regularity in these substructures between successive shells suggests an exactly
repeating formation mechanism combined with a highly stable outflow that
maintains a consistent morphology even after reaching 0.6 pc (assuming a
distance of 2.4 kpc) into the interstellar medium. The concentric dust shells
show subtle deviations from spherical outflow, which could reflect orbital
modulation along the eccentric binary orbit or some mild degree of
non-sphericity in the stellar wind. Tracking the evolution of dust across the
multi-tiered structure, we measure the dust temperature evolution that can
broadly be described with an amorphous carbon composition in radiative thermal
equilibrium with the central stars. The temperature profile and orbital period
place new distance constraints that support Apep being at a greater distance
than previously estimated, reducing the line-of-sight and sky-plane wind speed
discrepancy previously thought to characterise the system.

Abstract: We present the analysis of the extended Main Sequence Turn-Off (eMSTO) in the
open cluster NGC\,6067. We derive the projected rotational velocity,
\textit{v}sin\textit{i}, of the stars belonging to the eMSTO region of the main
sequence (MS) utilizing \textit{Gaia}-ESO spectra. Our results reveal a
positive correlation between \textit{v}sin\textit{i} and the color of eMSTO
stars, where fast-rotating stars predominantly occupy the red part of the MS
while slow-rotating ones prefer a bluer side of the MS. The gravity-darkening
effect might be a reason for this correlation. We find that most of the close
binaries present in the eMSTO population would be slow-rotating due to the
tidal-locking phenomenon. We identify four double-lined spectroscopic binaries
(SB2) featuring slow-rotating companions, further supporting this tidal-locking
hypothesis. However, the spatial distribution and the cumulative radial
distribution indicate a higher concentration of red eMSTO stars in the
cluster's central region than their bluer counterparts. This suggests that
tidal locking is less likely to be the cause of the observed spread in rotation
rates among eMSTO stars. Instead, we propose that star-disk interactions during
the pre-main-sequence phase might have played a crucial role in spreading the
rotation rates of stars, leading to the eMSTO phenomenon in NGC\,6067.

stars. Downstream of the shock between the stellar winds there exists a
suitable environment for dust grain formation, and the orbital motion of the
stars wraps this dust into richly structured spiral geometries. The Apep system
is the most extreme WR-CWB in our Milky Way: two WR stars produce a complex
spiral dust nebula, whose slow expansion has been linked to a gamma-ray burst
progenitor. It has been unclear whether the O-type supergiant 0.7" distant from
the WR+WR binary is physically associated with the system, and whether it
affects the dusty nebula. Multi-epoch VLT/VISIR and JWST/MIRI observations show
that this northern companion star routinely carves a cavity in the dust nebula
- the first time such an effect has been observed in a CWB - which
unambiguously associates the O star as a bound component to the Apep system.
These observations are used together with a new geometric model to infer the
cavity geometry and the orbit of the WR+WR binary, yielding the first strong
constraints on wind and orbital parameters. We confirm an orbital period of
over 190 years for the inner binary - nearly an order of magnitude longer than
the next longest period dust-producing WR-CWB. This, together with the
confirmed classification as a hierarchical triple, cements Apep as a singular
astrophysical laboratory for studying colliding winds and the terminal life
stages of the most massive star systems.

**TL;DR**: 在V883 Ori原行星盘中首次探测到乙二醇和乙醇腈，表明生命前分子在行星形成阶段持续积累。

Background: 探索星际介质中生命前分子在行星形成阶段的存续及其对行星潜在宜居性的影响。

Data: 使用阿塔卡马大型毫米波/亚毫米波阵列（ALMA）对爆发原恒星V883 Ori周围的原行星盘进行了观测。

Method: 利用ALMA观测数据，通过柱密度和温度建模分析EG和GN的发射特征。

Result: 在V883 Ori的原行星盘中首次探测到乙二醇和乙醇腈，表明前生命分子在行星形成阶段仍持续积累。

Abstract: Ethylene glycol ($\mathrm{(CH_2OH)_2}$, hereafter EG) and Glycolonitrile
($\mathrm{HOCH_2CN}$, hereafter GN) are considered molecular precursors of
nucleic acids. EG is a sugar alcohol and the reduced form of Glycolaldehyde
($\mathrm{CH_2(OH)CHO}$, hereafter GA). GN is considered a key precursor of
adenine formation (nucleotide) and can be a precursor of glycine (amino acid).
Detections of such prebiotic molecules in the interstellar medium are
increasingly common. How much of this complexity endures to the planet
formation stage, and thus is already present when planets form, remains largely
unknown. Here we report Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA)
observations in which we tentatively detect EG and GN in the protoplanetary
disk around the outbursting protostar V883 Ori. The observed EG emission is
best reproduced by a column density of $\mathrm{3.63^{+0.11}_{-0.12} \times
10^{16} \; cm^{-2}}$ and a temperature of at least 300 K. The observed GN
emission is best reproduced by a column density of
$\mathrm{3.37^{+0.09}_{-0.09} \times 10^{16} \; cm^{-2}}$ and a temperature of
$88^{+1.2}_{-1.2}$ K. Comparing the abundance of EG and GN relative to methanol
in V883 Ori with other objects, V883 Ori falls between hot cores and comets in
terms of increasing complexity. This suggests that the build up of prebiotic
molecules continues past the hot core phase into the epoch of planet formation.
Nascent planets in such environments may inherit essential building blocks for
life, enhancing their potential habitability. Further observations of this
protoplanetary disk at higher spectral resolution are required to resolve
blended lines and to confirm these tentative detection.

Abstract: Open clusters serve as important tools for accurately studying the chemical
evolution of the Milky Way. By combining precise chemical data from
high-resolution spectra with information on their distances and ages, we can
effectively uncover the processes that have shaped our Galaxy. This study aims
to derive NLTE atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances for approximately
one hundred giant stars across 33 open clusters with near-solar metallicity.
The clusters span a wide range of ages, enabling an assessment of the presence
and extent of any age-related abundance gradients. In the Stellar Population
Astrophysics (SPA) project, we acquired new high-resolution spectra of open
clusters using the HARPS-N echelle spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale
Galileo. We chemically characterized nine open clusters for the first time and
reanalyzed previously studied SPA clusters, resulting in a consistent and
homogeneous sample. We determined NLTE atmospheric parameters using the
equivalent width method and derived NLTE chemical abundances through spectral
synthesis for various elements, including alpha elements (Mg, Si, and Ti),
light odd-Z elements (Na, Al), iron-peak elements (Mn, Co, and Ni), and
neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, and Eu). Our findings are compared with the
existing literature, revealing good agreement. We examine the trends of [X/Fe]
versus age, confirming previous observations and the enrichment patterns
predicted by nucleosynthesis processes. Positive correlations with age are
present for Mg, Si, Ti, Al, Mn, Co, Ni, and Sr, while Na and Y and Eu show a
negative trend. This study emphasizes the significance of NLTE corrections and
reinforces the utility of open clusters as tracers of Galactic chemical
evolution. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark sample of NLTE abundances for
upcoming open cluster surveys within large-scale projects such as 4MOST and
WEAVE.

Abstract: To understand the chemical origin of the Solar system, the chemical evolution
along the star/planet formation is a key issue. Extensive observational studies
have demonstrated a chemical diversity in young low-mass protostellar sources
so far. Furthermore, chemical differentiations in the vicinity of the
protostars have recently been reported. This suggests that molecular
distribution is sensitive to a change in the physical conditions associated
with disk formation. Some kinds of molecular lines, especially Sulfur-bearing
species, are therefore prospected to work as molecular markers to highlight
particular structures of disk-forming regions. Conversely, detailed physical
characterization is essential for elucidating the chemical evolution occurring
there. Machine learnings may help us to disentangle the observed structures.
Angular momentum of the gas is the key topic to understand the structure
formation, which is also essential to the integration of the chemical and
physical characterization.

Abstract: Despite growing efforts to find the sources of high energy neutrinos measured
by IceCube, the bulk of the neutrinos remain with unknown origins. We aim to
constrain the emissivity of cosmic high-energy neutrinos from extragalactic
sources through their correlation with the large-scale structure. We use
cross-correlations between the IceCube 10-year dataset and tomographic maps of
the galaxy overdensity to place constraints on the bias-weighted high-energy
neutrino emissivity out to redshift $z\sim3$. We test two different models to
describe the evolution of neutrino emissivity with redshift, a power law model
$\propto (1+z)^a$, and a model tracking the star formation history, assuming a
simple power law model for the energy injection spectrum. We also consider a
non-parametric reconstruction of the astrophysical neutrino emissivity as a
function of redshift. We do not find any significant correlation, with our
strongest results corresponding to a $1.9 \sigma$ deviation with respect to a
model with zero signal. We use our measurements to place upper bounds on the
bias-weighted astrophysical high-energy neutrino emission rate as a function of
redshift for different source models. This analysis provides a new probe to
test extragalactic neutrino source models. With future neutrino and galaxy
datasets we expect the constraining and detection power of this type of
analysis analysis to increase.

Abstract: We present a crossmatch between a combined catalog of X-ray sources and the
Vera C. Rubin Observatory Data Preview 1 (DP1) to identify optical
counterparts. The six fields targeted as part of DP1 include the Extended
Chandra Deep Field South (E-CDF-S), the Euclid Deep Field South (EDF-S), the
Fornax Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (Fornax dSph), 47 Tucanae (47 Tuc) and science
validation fields with low galactic and ecliptic latitude (SV\_95\_-25 and
SV\_38\_7, respectively). We find matches to 2314 of 3830 X-ray sources. We
also compare our crossmatch to DP1 in the E-CDF-S field to previous efforts to
identify optical counterparts. The probability of a chance coincidence match
varies across each DP1 field, with overall high reliability in the E-CDF-S
field, and lower proportion of high-reliability matches in the other fields.
The majority of previously known sources that we detect are, unsurprisingly,
active galaxies. We plot the X-ray-to-optical flux ratio against optical
magnitude and color in an effort to identify Galactic accreting compact objects
using a {\em Gaia} color threshold transformed to LSST $g$--$i$, but do not
find any strong candidates in these primarily extragalactic counterparts. The
DP1 dataset contains high-cadence photometry collected over a number of nights.
We calculate the Stetson \( J \) variability index for each object under the
hypothesis that X-ray counterparts tend to exhibit higher optical variability;
however, the evidence is inconclusive whether our sample is more variable over
DP1 timescales when compared to field objects.

Abstract: The landmark detection of both gravitational waves (GWs) and electromagnetic
(EM) radiation from the binary neutron star merger GW170817 has spurred efforts
to streamline the follow-up of GW alerts in current and future observing runs
of ground-based GW detectors. Within this context, the radio band of the EM
spectrum presents unique challenges. Sensitive radio facilities capable of
detecting the faint radio afterglow seen in GW170817, and with sufficient
angular resolution, have small fields of view compared to typical GW
localization areas. Additionally, theoretical models predict that the radio
emission from binary neutron star mergers can evolve over weeks to years,
necessitating long-term monitoring to probe the physics of the various
post-merger ejecta components. These constraints, combined with limited radio
observing resources, make the development of more coordinated follow-up
strategies essential -- especially as the next generation of GW detectors
promise a dramatic increase in detection rates. Here, we present RADAR, a
framework designed to address these challenges by promoting community-driven
information sharing, federated data analysis, and system resilience, while
integrating AI methods for both GW signal identification and radio data
aggregation. We show that it is possible to preserve data rights while sharing
models that can help design and/or update follow-up strategies. We demonstrate
our approach through a case study of GW170817, and discuss future directions
for refinement and broader application.

Abstract: Recently discovered supermassive black holes with masses of
$\sim10^8\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\sim9$-$11$ in active galactic nuclei (AGN)
pose severe challenges to our understanding of supermassive black hole
formation. One proposed channel are rapidly accreting supermassive PopIII stars
(SMSs) that form in large primordial gas halos and grow up to $<10^6\,M_\odot$.
They eventually collapse due to the general relativistic instability and could
lead to supernova-like explosions. This releases massive and energetic ejecta
that then interact with the halo medium via an optically thick shock. We
develop a semi-analytic model to compute the shock properties, bolometric
luminosity, emission spectrum and photometry over time. The initial data is
informed by stellar evolution and general relativistic SMS collapse
simulations. We find that SMS explosion light curves reach a brightness
$\sim10^{45\mathrm{-}47}\,\mathrm{erg/s}$ and last $10$-$200$ years in the
source frame - up to $250$-$3000$ years with cosmic time dilation. This makes
them quasi-persistent sources which vary indistinguishably to little red dots
and AGN within $0.5$-$9\,(1+z)$ yrs. Bright SMS explosions are observable in
long-wavelength JWST filters up to $z\leq20$ ($24$-$26$ mag) and pulsating SMSs
up to $z\leq15$. EUCLID and the Roman space telescope (RST) can detect SMS
explosions at $z<11$-$12$. Their deep fields could constrain the SMS rate down
to $10^{-11}$Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, which is much deeper than JWST bounds. Based
on cosmological simulations and observed star formation rates, we expect to
image up to several hundred SMS explosions with EUCLID and dozens with RST deep
fields.

Abstract: The discovery of fast and variable coherent signals in a handful of
ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) testifies to the presence of super-Eddington
accreting neutron stars, and drastically changed the understanding of the ULX
class. Our capability of discovering pulsations in ULXs is limited, among
others, by poor statistics. However, catalogues and archives of high-energy
missions contain information which can be used to identify new candidate
pulsating ULXs (PULXs). The goal of this research is to single out candidate
PULXs among those ULXs which have not shown pulsations due to an unfavourable
combination of factors. We applied an AI approach to an updated database of
ULXs detected by XMM-Newton. We first used an unsupervised clustering algorithm
to sort out sources with similar characteristics into two clusters. Then, the
sample of known PULX observations has been used to set the separation threshold
between the two clusters and to identify the one containing the new candidate
PULXs. We found that only a few criteria are needed to assign the membership of
an observation to one of the two clusters. The cluster of new candidate PULXs
counts 85 unique sources for 355 observations, with $\sim$85% of these new
candidates having multiple observations. A preliminary timing analysis found no
new pulsations for these candidates. This work presents a sample of new
candidate PULXs observed by XMM-Newton, the properties of which are similar (in
a multi-dimensional phase space) to those of the known PULXs, despite the
absence of pulsations in their light curves. While this result is a clear
example of the predictive power of AI-based methods, it also highlights the
need for high-statistics observational data to reveal coherent signals from the
sources in this sample and thus validate the robustness of the approach.

Abstract: Blazars, including BL Lacs and FSRQs, are the most luminous extragalactic
{\gamma}-ray sources. They account for about 56% of the sources listed in the
recent Fermi-LAT catalog (4FGL-DR4). The optical and UV spectra of BL Lacs are
nearly featureless, making it difficult to precisely determine their redshifts.
Consequently, nearly half of the {\gamma}-ray BL Lacs lack reliable redshift
measurements. This poses a major challenge, since redshift is crucial for
studying the cosmic evolution of the blazar population and {\gamma}-ray
propagation studies such as indirect evidence of EBL, placing constraints on
IGMF and searches for LIV and ALPs. This paper is the fourth in a series
dedicated to determining the redshift of a sample of blazars identified as key
targets for future observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory
(CTAO). We performed Monte Carlo simulations to select {\gamma}-ray blazars
detected by Fermi-LAT with hard spectra, that lack redshift measurements. These
blazars are expected to be detectable by CTAO within 30 hours or less of
exposure assuming an average flux state. In this fourth paper, we report the
results of detailed spectroscopic observations of 29 blazars using the ESO/VLT,
Keck II, and SALT telescopes. Our analysis involved a thorough search for
spectral lines in the spectra of each blazar, and when features of the host
galaxy were identified, we modeled its properties. We also compared the
magnitudes of the targets during the observations to their long-term light
curves. In the sample studied, 9 of 29 sources were observed with a high
signal-to-noise ratio (S/N > 100), while the remaining 20 were observed with a
moderate or low S/N. We successfully determined firm redshifts for 12 blazars,
ranging from 0.1636 to 1.1427, and identified two lower limit redshifts at z >
1.0196 and z > 1.4454. The remaining 15 BL Lac objects exhibited featureless
spectra.

Result: LEOsats对CSST巡天观测的样本影响较小。

Abstract: It is projected that more than 100,000 communication satellites will be
deployed in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) over the next decade. These LEO satellites
(LEOsats) will be captured frequently by the survey camera onboard the China
Space Station Telescope (CSST), contaminating sources in the images. As such,
it is necessary to assess the impact of LEOsats on CSST survey observations. We
use the images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in its F814W band to
simulate $i$-band images for the CSST. The simulation results indicate that
LEOsats at higher altitudes cause more contamination than those at lower
altitudes. If 100,000 LEOsats are deployed at altitudes between 550 km and 1200
km with a 53-degree orbital inclination, the fraction of contaminated sources
in a 150-s exposure image would remain below 0.50%. For slitless spectroscopic
images, the contaminated area is expected to be below 1.50%. After removing the
LEOsat trails, the residual photon noise contributes to relative photometric
errors that exceed one-tenth of the total error budget in approximately 0.10%
of all sources. Our investigation shows that even though LEOsats are
unavoidable in CSST observations, they only have a minor impact on samples
extracted from the CSST survey.

Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the interstellar object
3I/ATLAS, obtained with Gemini-S/GMOS and NASA IRTF/SpeX on 2025 July 5 and
July 14. The optical spectrum shows a red slope of approximately 10% per 1000
angstroms between 0.5 and 0.8 microns, closely resembling that of typical
D-type asteroids. At longer wavelengths, the near-infrared spectrum flattens
significantly to approximately 3% per 1000 angstroms from 0.9 to 1.5 microns,
consistent with the spectral behavior of large water ice grains in the coma.
Spectral modeling with an areal mixture of 70% Tagish Lake meteorite and 30%
10-micron-sized water ice successfully reproduces both the overall continuum
and the broad absorption feature near 2.0 microns. The 1.5-micron water ice
band, however, is not detected, likely due to the limited signal-to-noise of
the IRTF data and dilution by refractory materials. The ~30% ice fraction
should be interpreted as an approximate, order-of-magnitude estimate of the
coma composition. The agreement between the GMOS and SpeX spectra, taken nine
days apart, suggests short-term stability in the coma's optical properties. Our
observations reveal that 3I/ATLAS is an active interstellar comet containing
abundant water ice, with a dust composition more similar to D-type asteroids

**TL;DR**: 研究发现从火星出发的航天器可在2025年7-9月以约5 km/s的速度增量实现10月初飞越星际天体3I/ATLAS，比地球出发任务更具可行性。

Background: 探索利用现有航天器对星际天体3I/ATLAS进行飞越探测的可行性。

Data: 数据来源包括地球存储的现成航天器（如Janus）和火星附近即将结束任务的航天器。

Method: 计算了从地球和火星出发的单脉冲直接转移轨迹的最小ΔV。

Result: 火星出发的航天器在2025年7月至9月间仅需约5 km s−1的速度增量即可在10月初飞掠3I/ATLAS。

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of a spacecraft mission to conduct a flyby of
3I/ATLAS, the third macroscopic interstellar object discovered on July 1 2025,
as it traverses the Solar System. There are both ready-to-launch spacecraft
currently in storage on Earth, such as Janus, and spacecraft nearing the end of
their missions at Mars. We calculate minimum $\Delta V$ single-impulse direct
transfer trajectories to 3I/ATLAS both from Earth and from Mars. We consider
launch dates spanning January 2025 through March 2026 to explore obtainable and
hypothetical mission scenarios. Post-discovery Earth departures require a
challenging $\Delta V\gtrsim24$ km s$^{-1}$ to fly by 3I/ATLAS. By contrast,
Mars departures from July 2025 - September 2025 require $\Delta V\sim5$ km
s$^{-1}$ to achieve an early October flyby -- which is more feasible with
existing propulsion capabilities. We discuss how existing spacecraft could be
used to observe 3I/ATLAS and how spacecraft at other locations in the Solar
System could be repurposed to visit future interstellar objects on short
notice.

Background: 探讨地球重大历史事件（如地球形成、生命起源、大冰期和物种大灭绝）与太阳被超级星云捕获的天文背景之间的关联。

Data: 数据来源于对太阳系历史事件的天文观测记录和模拟分析，包括太阳捕获超级云事件、彗星捕获过程以及相关地质和生物事件的关联数据。

Abstract: With the same general purposes as Part I of this monograph, we analyze here
major events in the history of the Earth, such as the formation of the Earth
itself, the origin of life, the great glaciations and the mass extinctions of
species, and we also analyze the astronomical context in which they occurred.
We argue that the Sun was captured around 500-700 Myr ago by a supercloud, of
which the Orion arm and Gould's belt are currently part, and that this event
marked the history of the Earth. With this fact, we associate a massive capture
of comets by the Sun, the great glaciations of the Cryogenic period, the
emergence of complex life in the Cambrian and the recurrent mass extinctions of
species.

**TL;DR**: 提出了一种用于爱因斯坦望远镜地震隔离的多尺度最优控制框架，通过联合优化反馈和混合滤波器显著降低了低频平台运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究主题为爱因斯坦望远镜中的主动地震隔离多尺度最优控制框架。

Data: 使用来自OmniSens六自由度惯性隔离系统和结合了BRS-T360（包含光束旋转传感器作为惯性倾斜传感器与T360水平地震计）的两种候选传感系统的观测数据。

Method: 采用基于"非因果最优"统一代价函数的多尺度最优控制框架，联合优化交叉耦合光机械系统中的反馈和混合滤波器。

Result: 提出了一种基于"非因果最优"统一成本函数的多尺度最优控制框架，显著提升了爱因斯坦望远镜在微震频段的活动地震隔离性能。

Abstract: We present a multi-scale optimal control framework for active seismic
isolation in the Einstein Telescope, a third-generation gravitational-wave
observatory. Our approach jointly optimizes feedback and blending filters in a
cross-coupled opto-mechanical system using a unified cost function based on the
"acausal optimum," which quantifies sensor signal-to-noise ratios across
frequencies. This method enables efficient re-optimization under varying sensor
configurations and environmental conditions. We apply the framework to two
candidate sensing systems: OmniSens-a six-degree-of-freedom inertial isolation
system-and BRS-T360, which combines Beam Rotation Sensor (BRS) as an inertial
tilt sensor with T360 as a horizontal seismometer. We demonstrate superior
low-frequency isolation with OmniSens, reducing platform motion by up to two
orders of magnitude near the microseism. The framework allows for ready
optimization and projection of sensor noise to metrics relevant to the
performance of the instrument, aiding the design of the Einstein Telescope.

Result: ADS与官方影响因子之间未发现系统性偏差，但PTEP和《Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science》的官方影响因子与中位数影响因子存在最大相对差异，分别由一篇高引论文导致。

Abstract: In this work, we calculate the 2025 impact factors for 16 journals in
Particle Physics (and related areas such as Nuclear Physics) using citations
collated by NASA/ADS (Astrophysics Data System). We then compare them to the
official impact factors calculated by Clarivate. We also compare these impact
factors to the median-based impact factors introduced in a previous work. We do
not find any systematic bias between the ADS and official impact factors. We
find the maximum relative difference between official and median-based impact
factors for PTEP and Annual Review of Nuclear and Particle Science. For PTEP,
this difference is due to one outlier, viz Particle Data Group with over 1400
citations in the last two years. Similarly for Annual Review of Nuclear and
Particle Science, the difference is due to a review paper on Hubble tension and
early dark energy with over 100 citations in the past two years. Both these
papers have significantly elevated the official impact factors above its median
value.

Abstract: The study of solar neutrinos presents significant opportunities in
astrophysics, nuclear physics, and particle physics. However, the low-energy
nature of these neutrinos introduces considerable challenges to isolate them
from background events, requiring detectors with low-energy threshold, high
spatial and energy resolutions, and low data rate. We present the study of
solar neutrinos with a kiloton-scale liquid argon detector located underground,
instrumented with a pixel readout using the Q-Pix technology. We explore the
potential of using volume fiducialization, directional topological information,
light signal coincidence and pulse-shape discrimination to enhance solar
neutrino sensitivity. We find that discriminating neutrino signals below 5 MeV
is very difficult. However, we show that these methods are useful for the
detection of solar neutrinos when external backgrounds are sufficiently
understood and when the detector is built using low-background techniques. When
building a workable background model for this study, we identify {\gamma}
background from the cavern walls and from capture of {\alpha} particles in
radon decay chains as both critical to solar neutrino sensitivity and
significantly underconstrained by existing measurements. Finally, we highlight
that the main advantage of the use of Q-Pix for solar neutrino studies lies in
its ability to enable the continuous readout of all low-energy events with
minimal data rates and manageable storage for further offline analyses.

Background: 探索如何改进大语言模型在天文学等科学研究中的评估方法以提升其实用性。

Data: 数据来源于对Slack平台上部署的天文学文献检索增强生成机器人的368条查询进行归纳编码，以及对11位天文学家的后续访谈。

Method: 采用归纳编码和用户访谈分析天文学家对LLM辅助天文文献检索工具的评价标准。

Result: 通过分析天文学家对LLM辅助文献检索工具的使用反馈，提出了改进LLM评估基准的具体建议。

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to aid in astronomy and other
scientific research, but benchmarks for LLM evaluation in general have not kept
pace with the increasingly diverse ways that real people evaluate and use these
models. In this study, we seek to improve evaluation procedures by building an
understanding of how users evaluate LLMs. We focus on a particular use case: an
LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation bot for engaging with astronomical
literature, which we deployed via Slack. Our inductive coding of 368 queries to
the bot over four weeks and our follow-up interviews with 11 astronomers reveal
how humans evaluated this system, including the types of questions asked and
the criteria for judging responses. We synthesize our findings into concrete
recommendations for building better benchmarks, which we then employ in
constructing a sample benchmark for evaluating LLMs for astronomy. Overall, our
work offers ways to improve LLM evaluation and ultimately usability,
particularly for use in scientific research.

Abstract: The persistent discrepancy between the experimental measurement and the
Standard Model (SM) prediction of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment
$(g-2)_\mu$ remains one of the most intriguing hints of physics beyond the SM.
A well-motivated explanation involves a light $Z'$ gauge boson associated with
a broken $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ symmetry. Such a boson not only resolves the
$(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly, but also induces resonant interactions between high-energy
cosmic neutrinos and the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B), potentially
shaping the observable neutrino flux at Earth. In this work, we explore the
implications of such interactions for the cosmic propagation of high-energy
neutrinos. We compute the optical depth for neutrino attenuation via
$Z'$-mediated scattering, accounting for neutrino masses, hierarchies, and
thermal distributions. We delineate the regions in $(m_{Z'}, m_\nu)$ space
where the optical depth exceeds unity, defining a "neutrino cosmic horizon"
beyond which high-energy neutrinos are significantly attenuated. We confront
these results with the parameter space required to simultaneously explain the
muon $g-2$ anomaly and ease the Hubble tension via an additional contribution
to the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta
N_{\mathrm{eff}} \simeq 0.2-0.5$. Our analysis reveals a consistent region in
parameter space where all three phenomena - $(g-2)_\mu$, $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$,
and high-energy neutrino attenuation-can be explained by the same light
mediator. These findings motivate future searches for spectral features in
IceCube and its next-generation successors as indirect probes of new physics in
the neutrino sector.

Abstract: Wormholes are non-trivial topological structures that arise as exact
solutions to Einstein's field equations, theoretically connecting distinct
regions of spacetime via a throat-like geometry. While static traversable
wormholes necessarily require exotic matter that violates the classical energy
conditions, subsequent studies have sought to minimize such violations by
introducing time-dependent geometries embedded within cosmological backgrounds.
This review provides a comprehensive survey of evolving wormhole solutions,
emphasizing their formulation within both general relativity and alternative
theories of gravity. We explore key developments in the construction of
non-static wormhole spacetimes, including those conformally related to static
solutions, as well as dynamically evolving geometries influenced by scalar
fields. Particular attention is given to the wormholes embedded into
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes and de Sitter
backgrounds, where the interplay between the cosmic expansion and wormhole
dynamics is analyzed. We also examine the role of modified gravity theories,
especially in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity, which enable the realization of
traversable wormholes supported by effective stress-energy tensors that do not
violate the null or weak energy conditions. By systematically analyzing a wide
range of time-dependent wormhole solutions, this review identifies the specific
geometric and physical conditions under which wormholes can evolve consistently
with the null and weak energy conditions. These findings clarify how such
configurations can be naturally integrated into cosmological models governed by
general relativity or modified gravity, thereby contributing to a deeper
theoretical understanding of localized spacetime structures in an expanding
universe.

Abstract: Ultralight scalars can form superradiant clouds around rotating black holes.
These may alter the dynamics of compact binaries and the ensuing waveform
through orbital resonances and cloud ionization. We re-examine resonances
involving states with nonzero decay width, deriving an effective treatment for
resonances that are wider than the binary's frequency chirp. We demonstrate the
utility of this approach by calculating an upper bound for the cloud's mass
surviving up to the latest stages of the inspiral. Next, we study the
accumulation of resonances with high-energy bound states. When these infinitely
many, increasingly weak resonances are properly taken into account, they smooth
out the "sharp features" in the binary's evolution that had been attributed to
the ionization of the cloud. We compare our Newtonian results with recent
relativistic calculations, highlighting common features as well as
discrepancies. Our conclusions emphasize the need to carefully incorporate
resonances in boson cloud waveform modeling.

Abstract: We propose a new dark energy (DE) model from four parameter generalized
entropy function of apparent horizon in a spatially flat universe. Such kind of
generalized entropy is able to generalize all the known entropies proposed so
far, for suitable representations of the entropic parameters. It turns out that
the scenario can describe the correct thermal history of the universe, with the
sequence of matter and dark energy epochs. Comparing with the $\Lambda$CDM
model, the proposed generalized entropic DE model provides a higher value of
present Hubble parameter for certain range of entropic parameter(s) leading to
a possible resolution of Hubble tension issue. We confront the scenario with
CC, PantheonPlus+SH0ES, DESI DR1 and compressed Planck likelihood datasets,
which clearly depicts the phenomenological viability of the present model for
some best fitted values of entropic parameter(s) that are indeed consistent
with the resolution of Hubble tension.

Abstract: We present GravLensX, an innovative method for rendering black holes with
gravitational lensing effects using neural networks. The methodology involves
training neural networks to fit the spacetime around black holes and then
employing these trained models to generate the path of light rays affected by
gravitational lensing. This enables efficient and scalable simulations of black
holes with optically thin accretion disks, significantly decreasing the time
required for rendering compared to traditional methods. We validate our
approach through extensive rendering of multiple black hole systems with
superposed Kerr metric, demonstrating its capability to produce accurate
visualizations with significantly $15\times$ reduced computational time. Our
findings suggest that neural networks offer a promising alternative for
rendering complex astrophysical phenomena, potentially paving a new path to
astronomical visualization.
