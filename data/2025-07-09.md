### [1] [Explaining ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at $3 < z < 5$ in the context of their environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05340)
*Christian K. Jespersen,Adam C. Carnall,Christopher C. Lovell*

**TL;DR**: 发现3<z<5红移区间的超大质量静止星系的高密度环境可解释其快速形成机制，缓解与简单星系形成模型的矛盾。

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究早期宇宙中超大质量静止星系快速形成的机制及其与星系环境密度的关系。

Data: 使用了经过修改的极端值统计（EVS）代码，该代码通过纳入星系环境中的聚类信息来分析数据。

Method: 采用改进的极值统计方法（EVS），在计算中纳入星系环境聚类效应。

Result: 早期宇宙中超大质量静止星系的质量可以通过其所在的高密度环境来解释。

Abstract: The swift assembly of the earliest galaxies poses a significant challenge to
our understanding of galaxy formation. Ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at
intermediate redshifts ($3 < z < 5$) currently present one of the most pressing
problems for theoretical modeling, since very few mechanisms can be invoked to
explain how such galaxies formed so early in the history of the Universe. Here,
we exploit the fact that these galaxies all reside within significant
overdensities to explain their masses. To this end, we construct and release a
modified version of the Extreme Value Statistics (EVS) code which takes into
account galaxy environment by incorporating clustering in the calculation. With
this new version of EVS, we find that ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at
$3<z<5$ do not present as serious a tension with simple models of galaxy
formation when the analysis of a given galaxy is conditioned on its
environment.

**TL;DR**: 通过流体动力学模拟发现，机械超新星反馈对椭圆宿主星系卫星的数量、大小和金属丰度起关键作用，弱反馈模型会过多产生小质量致密卫星且金属丰度过高，而包含机械反馈的基准模型更符合观测。

Background: 探讨超新星反馈对椭圆星系卫星系统的影响及其在星系形成与演化中的作用。

Data: 使用修改版GADGET-3代码对11个恒星质量在10^11到2×10^11太阳质量之间的椭圆星系进行宇宙学放大模拟，包含两组初始条件相同的模拟：基准模型采用三相超新星机械风反馈，弱反馈模型则将超新星能量主要以热能形式释放并降低星风速度。

Method: 采用改进版GADGET-3代码进行包含机械风三阶段超新星反馈的流体动力学宇宙学放大模拟。

Result: 弱超新星反馈模型相比基准模型产生了更多卫星星系，且其数量远超观测值，同时这些卫星星系更致密、金属丰度更高，而包含机械超新星反馈的基准模型更符合观测。

Abstract: We investigate the influence of supernova (SN) feedback on the satellites of
elliptical host galaxies using hydrodynamic simulations. Utilizing a modified
version of the GADGET-3 code, we perform cosmological zoom-in simulations of 11
elliptical galaxies with stellar masses in the range $10^{11} M_{\odot} < M_{*}
< 2 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot}$. We conduct two sets of simulations with
identical initial conditions: the Fiducial model, which includes a three-phase
SN mechanical wind, and the weak SN feedback model, where nearly all SN energy
is released as thermal energy with a reduced SN wind velocity. Our comparison
shows minimal differences in the elliptical host galaxies, but significant
variations in the physical properties of satellite galaxies. The weak SN
feedback model produces a larger number of satellite galaxies compared to the
Fiducial model, and significantly more than observed. For satellite galaxies
with stellar masses above $10^{8}$ $M_{\odot}$, the weak SN feedback model
generates approximately five times more satellites than observed in the xSAGA
survey. Most of these overproduced satellites have small stellar masses, below
$10^{10}$ $M_{\odot}$. Additionally, satellites in the weak SN feedback model
are about 3.5 times more compact than those observed in the SAGA survey and the
Fiducial model, with metallicities nearly 1 dex higher than observed values. In
conclusion, the satellite galaxies in the Fiducial model, which includes
mechanical SN feedback, exhibit properties more closely aligned with
observations. This underscores the necessity of incorporating both mechanical
AGN and SN feedback to reproduce the observed properties of elliptical galaxy
and their satellites in simulations.

Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are believed to play a central role in quenching
star formation by removing or destroying molecular gas from host galaxies via
radiation-pressure driven outflows and/or radio jets. Some studies of cold
molecular gas in galaxies at Cosmic Noon ($z\sim2$) show that AGN have less
cold gas ($<$100 K) compared to mass-matched star-forming galaxies. However,
cold gas could also be shock-heated to warmer phases, detectable via H$_{2}$
transitions in the rest-frame near- and mid-infrared spectra. The Medium
Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) of the Mid-infrared Instrument (MIRI) aboard JWST
has opened a unique window to observe these emission lines in galaxies at
Cosmic Noon. We present the first detection of hot molecular gas in cid_346, an
X-ray AGN at $z\sim2.2$, via the H$_{2}$ ro-vibrational transition at 2.12
$\mu$m. We measure a hot molecular gas mass of $\sim 8.0 \times 10^{5}$
M$_{\odot}$, which is $\sim 10^{5}-10^{6}$ times lower than the cold molecular
gas mass. cid_346 is located in an environment with extended gas structures and
satellite galaxies. This is supported by detection of hot and cold molecular
gas out to distances $>$10 kpc in MIRI/MRS and ALMA data, respectively and
ancillary NIRCam imaging that reveals two satellite galaxies at distances of
$\sim$0.4 arcsec (3.3 kpc) and $\sim$0.9 arcsec (7.4 kpc) from the AGN. Our
results tentatively indicate that while the CO(3-2)-based cold gas phase
dominates the molecular gas mass at Cosmic Noon, H$_{2}$ ro-vibrational
transitions are effective in tracing hot molecular gas locally in regions that
may lack CO emission.

**TL;DR**: 发现21%的X射线选宽线活动星系核具有双峰发射线特征，其黑洞质量高0.4 dex、爱丁顿比低0.3 dex且更倾向椭圆宿主星系。

Data: 使用BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey（BASS）的超硬X射线选择的通量限制样本的光学光谱数据。

Result: 发现约21%的X射线选宽线活动星系核为双峰发射体，其黑洞质量平均高0.4 dex、爱丁顿比低0.3 dex，且更倾向寄居椭圆星系。

Abstract: A fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have double-peaked H$\alpha$,
H$\beta$ and Mg II broad lines attributed to emission from rotating gas in the
accretion disk. Using optical spectroscopy of a flux-limited sample of AGN
selected via ultrahard X-rays from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), we
systematically identify 71 double-peaked emitters amongst 343 broad-line AGN
with redshifts $0.004<z<0.297$ and 2-10 KeV X-ray luminosities of log 40-45.7
(erg/s), and provide their best-fit accretion disk geometry parameters. We find
that ~21% of X-ray selected broad-line AGN are double-peaked emitters (DPEs),
consistent with rates previously reported for $z<0.2$ broad-line AGN selected
for strong optical variability in ZTF. 11 of 71 DPEs (15%) exhibited a
single-peaked Gaussian component to the broad line profile in addition to the
double-peaked disk profile. In this sample, DPEs have intrinsically higher
masses by ~0.4 dex and lower Eddington ratios by ~0.3 dex than other broad-line
AGN, and have a preference for elliptical host galaxies, higher X-ray
luminosities, and higher [OI] $\lambda$6302 to narrow H$\alpha$ flux ratios
than other broad-line AGN. We find that DPEs are not segregated from other
broad-line AGN in the $L_{\rm bol}$ vs $M_{\rm BH}$ relation or their X-ray to
radio luminosity ratios, and do not show a preference for intermediate Seyfert
types over Seyfert 1s. We do not find differences in a wide range of
multi-wavelength properties when comparing DPEs to other broad-line AGN,
including optical and mid-IR variability levels, and the rate of changing-look
events. We discuss the two populations in the context of multi-component
disk-wind models of the AGN broad line region and consider how unrecognized
contributions of disk emission to the broad lines introduce biases in virial
SMBH mass estimates.

Result: 类星体附近电离区中的高红移星系具有更高的莱曼α等效宽度和蓝移特征，且莱曼α逃逸分数平均为0.14±0.04。

Abstract: Ionized proximity zones around luminous quasars provide a unique laboratory
to characterize the Ly$\alpha$ emission lines from $z>6$ galaxies without
significant attenuation from the intergalactic medium (IGM). However,
Ly$\alpha$ line measurements for galaxies within high-redshift quasars'
proximity zones have been rare so far. Here we present deep spectroscopic
observations obtained with the NIRSpec/MSA instrument on the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) of galaxies in two $z>6$ quasar fields. We measure the
Ly$\alpha$ line fluxes for 50 galaxies at $6<z<7$ with UV absolute magnitude
$M_\text{UV}<-19$ (median $M_\text{UV}=-19.97$), among which 15 are located
near the luminous quasars, i.e. within $\Delta v<2500\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$. We find
that galaxies near the quasars show significant flux bluewards of the systemic
Ly$\alpha$ wavelength, and have higher Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width compared to
galaxies at similar redshifts that are not located within the quasars'
environment. Our result indicates little or no redshift evolution for the
Ly$\alpha$-emitter fraction from $z\sim6.4$ to $z\sim5$. Leveraging the low IGM
opacity in the quasars' vicinity, we evaluate the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction
($f_\text{esc}^{\text{Ly}\alpha}$) of high-redshift galaxies. Our analysis
suggests that galaxies at $\langle z\rangle\approx6.4$ have an average
$f_\text{esc}^{\text{Ly}\alpha}=0.14\pm0.04$. This value is consistent with
reionization models where the Lyman continuum escape fraction is low
$(f_\text{esc}^\text{LyC}\lesssim0.1)$ for luminous galaxies, and where the
most luminous galaxies have only a minor contribution to the total ionizing
photon budget.

Method: 采用CCD UBV测光和Gaia数据，结合UPMASK算法估计成员星概率，并运用经典方法和马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）方法同时拟合基本参数。

Result: 确定了Czernik 41和NGC 1342的距离分别为2485±151 pc和645±42 pc，年龄分别为69±10 Myr和1000±50 Myr，金属丰度分别为0.07±0.09 dex和-0.14±0.07 dex。

Abstract: In this study, the structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and Galactic orbital
parameters of the open clusters Czernik 41 and NGC 1342, as well as their
dynamical evolution, are investigated using CCD UBV photometry and Gaia data.
By applying the UPMASK algorithm to Gaia astrometric data for the estimation of
cluster membership probabilities, we have determined that 382 stars in Czernik
41 and 111 stars in NGC 1342 exhibit the highest statistical likelihood of
being cluster members. Fundamental parameters (including reddening,
metallicity, distance, and age) were derived using both classical methods,
where parameters are determined separately, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods, where parameters are estimated simultaneously. The results obtained
from both approaches are in agreement, confirming the reliability of the
derived parameters and demonstrating their robustness against potential
degeneracies. The distances to Czernik 41 and NGC 1342 were determined as
2485$\pm$151 pc and 645$\pm$42 pc, respectively, while their ages were
estimated to be 69$\pm$10 Myr and 1000$\pm$50 Myr. The metallicity values
([Fe/H]) were found to be 0.07$\pm$0.09 dex for Czernik 41 and -0.14$\pm$0.07
dex for NGC 1342. The stellar mass functions for both clusters were derived,
yielding slopes of $\Gamma$=1.67$\pm$0.23 for Czernik 41 and $\Gamma$
=1.56$\pm$0.41 for NGC 1342. Kinematic orbit analysis indicates that Czernik 41
originated within the Solar circle, whereas NGC 1342 formed outside it.

Abstract: The orbits of planetary systems can be deformed from their initial
configurations due to close encounters with larger astrophysical bodies.
Typical candidates for close encounters are stars and binaries. We explore the
prospect that if there is a sizeable population of primordial black holes (PBH)
in our galaxy, then these may also impact the orbits of exoplanets.
Specifically, in a simplified setting, we study numerically how many planetary
systems might have a close encounter with a PBH, and analyze the potential
changes to the orbital parameters of systems that undergo PBH flybys.

Result: 卫星数量在z=1前快速增长后保持稳定，不同时期卫星的瓦解比例随红移降低而递减，大质量卫星在宿主附近较晚停止恒星形成，小质量卫星则较早且在宿主外部停止恒星形成。

Abstract: The abundance and star-formation histories of satellites of Milky Way
(MW)-like galaxies are linked to their hosts' assembly histories. To explore
this connection, we use the PARADIGM suite of zoom-in hydrodynamical
simulations of MW-mass haloes, evolving the same initial conditions spanning
various halo assembly histories with the VINTERGATAN and IllustrisTNG models.
Our VINTERGATAN simulations overpredict the number of satellites compared to
observations (and to IllustrisTNG) due to a higher $M_{*}$ at fixed $M_{\rm
halo}$. Despite this difference, the two models show good qualitative agreement
for both satellite disruption fractions and timescales, and quenching. The
number of satellites rises rapidly until $z=1$ and then remains nearly
constant. The fraction of satellites from each epoch that are disrupted by
$z=0$ decreases steadily from nearly 100% to 0% during $4>z>0.1$. These
fractions are higher for VINTERGATAN than IllustrisTNG, except for massive
satellites ($M_{*}>10^{7}\,M_{\odot}$) at $z>0.5$. This difference is largely
due to varying distributions of pericentric distance, orbital period and number
of orbits, in turn determined by which sub(haloes) are populated with galaxies
by the two models. The time between accretion and disruption also remains
approximately constant over $2>z>0.3$ at $6-8$ Gyr. For surviving satellites at
$z=0$, both models recover the observed trend of massive satellites quenching
more recently ($<8$ Gyr ago) and within $1.5\,r_{\rm 200c}$ of the host, while
low mass satellites quench earlier and often outside the host. Our results
provide constraints on satellite accretion, quenching and disruption
timescales, while highlighting the convergent trends from two very different
galaxy formation models.

Result: 利用ICL与总物质投影密度的幂律关系，基于观测ICL和模拟校准关系可独立估算星系团质量。

Abstract: Context. The intra-cluster light (ICL) comprises stars that are unbound to
individual galaxies within a galaxy cluster and provides insights into the
cluster's mass distribution, evolutionary history and dynamical state. Aims. We
aim to study the viability of the intra-cluster stellar mass as a proxy to
compute the total mass profiles of galaxy clusters. Methods. High-resolution
simulations from the C-EAGLE project are used to study the ratio between
intra-cluster stellar mass and total matter projected densities. This ratio
follows a power-law, and a model is presented for its fit parameters and
associated errors. Results. The aforementioned relation is used to estimate the
mass profile of the Perseus cluster using Euclid observations that extend up to
1/3 of the virial radius. The obtained cluster mass is compatible with other
measurements from galaxy velocity dispersion, though it is overestimated by a
factor 2 compared to X-ray mass estimates. We repeat this process for four
clusters in the Hubble Frontier Fields, finding compatibility with weak and
strong lensing mass estimates. Conclusions. This methodology provides an
independent approach to cluster mass estimation based solely on observed ICL
and a simulation-calibrated relation.

Abstract: In this study we use Integral Field Spectroscopic (IFS) observations for one
of the closest galaxy to us, the grand design spiral IC 342, to derive physical
properties of HII regions at sub-kpc scales. This IFS data represents, to our
knowledge, the most comprehensive observational effort in the optical for this
galaxy. The final IFS datacube consists of 349 individual pointings using the
IFS instrumentation from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. Using a prototype of the
data analysis pipeline that will be devoted to the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper
(LVM) survey, we measure different observables from the emission line in the
optical. In particular, using the flux map of the H$\alpha$ emission line, we
derive the location and sizes of H ii region candidates for IC 342. Using the
integrated flux for different emission lines within each region, we derived the
radial distribution of different physical properties from the ionized gas
(e.g., optical extinction, H$\alpha$ luminosity, oxygen abundance, etc).
Comparing with larger samples of galaxies with IFS data, our results suggest
that physical properties of the ionized gas of IC 342 are similar to galaxies
with similar stellar mass in the nearby universe.

Result: Earendel和另一个星团1b具有中等年龄（约30-150 Myr）、低金属丰度（Z⋆≲10% Z⊙），且符合本地球状星团的年龄-金属丰度关系。

Abstract: The strongly-lensed $z\sim 6$ Sunrise galaxy offers an incredible opportunity
to investigate star formation in the early universe on parsec or smaller
scales. The highly magnified object Earendel within the Sunrise was previously
identified as a candidate star or binary due to size constraints placed by the
lensing magnification, however recent works have suggested this constraint may
be relaxed to even the size of star clusters. Here, we explore the hypothesis
that Earendel may actually be a star cluster, and simultaneously evaluate other
star clusters within the host galaxy. Leveraging deep, archival James Webb
Space Telescope NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopy, we determine a spectroscopic
redshift for the Sunrise galaxy $z=5.926 \pm 0.013$, and we fit simple stellar
population (SSP) models from three premier libraries to evaluate the physical
parameters of Earendel and another distinct star cluster in the Sunrise dubbed
`$1b$'. We find the rest-UV through optical continuum of Earendel to be
well-described by an SSP, nearly equivalently to $1b$ which is confidently a
star cluster. We infer they have intermediate ages $t_{\rm age}\sim
30$--$150\,$Myr, are metal poor ($Z_\star\lesssim10\%\,Z_\odot$), and are
consistent with the formation age-metallicity trend seen in local globular
clusters. Such intermediate age clusters are seldom probed spectroscopically in
the high redshift universe, and we explore the extent to which these clusters
can be characterized via the spectroscopic continuum.

Abstract: Globular Clusters (GCs) displaying extended structures are becoming
increasingly ubiquitous in the Milky Way (MW). Despite their low surface
brightness, which makes disentangling the true structure from the MW
overwhelmingly difficult, the increasing availability of multi-dimensional data
sets has allowed for new detections of extended GC structure. This work
utilises the Pristine-Gaia-Synthetic catalogue released as part of the Pristine
Surveys first data release to search for tidally stripped stars in the
peripheries of MW GCs. Pristine provides photometric [Fe/H] measurements based
on CaHK-band photometry. Using unsupervised machine learning techniques, we
provided lists of extra-tidal stars for 30 GCs, one of the largest surveys of
its kind. We find that (1) 22 GCs that passed our quality cut have extended
structure within 5 deg from the cluster centers of which six are new tentative
detections, (2) four of those GCs exhibit diffuse envelope-like extra-tidal
features, while the remaining GCs exhibit tidal tail-like structures. We
measure the position angles of the extended structures, find broad consistency
between the position angles and the GC orbits, and discuss our results
concerning N-body models. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of adding
photometric metallicities to the multi-dimensional search of extended tidal
structure and how the upcoming multi-object spectrographs will be crucial for
exploring GC peripheries in the coming years.

Abstract: We present the analysis of the stellar populations and kinematics of the
globular cluster (GC) rich ultra-diffuse galaxy, PUDG-R21, using spectroscopic
observations obtained with the Keck Cosmic Web Imager (KCWI). The recessional
velocity is measured to be 5536$\pm$10 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$, confirming its
association with the Perseus cluster. The galaxy exhibits mild rotation of
15.6$\pm$10 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$ and a stellar velocity dispersion of
19.4$\pm$3.5 km s$^{\mathrm{-1}}$ within the galaxy effective radius. From
this, we infer a dynamical mass of M$_{\mathrm{dyn}}=9.3\pm3.3\times10^{8}$
M$_{\odot}$. Based on a halo mass derived from PUDG-R21 GC counts, we find our
dynamical mass is consistent with a cored dark matter profile. The integrated
stellar population analysis reveals a predominantly old stellar population of
10.4$\pm$1.2 Gyr, with intermediate-low metallicity ([M/H]=-0.64$\pm$0.12 dex)
and elevated alpha abundances ([Mg/Fe]=0.38$\pm$0.25 dex). The inferred star
formation history suggests rapid stellar assembly, likely truncating prior to
or during the galaxy's infall into the cluster at an early epoch ($\sim$10 Gyr
ago). The analysis of stellar population gradients (age and metallicity)
indicates a flat profile out to one effective radius. Here, we consider the
involvement of two star formation events, initially forming a large population
of metal-poor globular clusters, and then the latter contributing to the more
metal-enriched diffuse stellar body. The evidence of subsequent star formation
suggests this galaxy is more like an extension of the classical dwarf
population than the much discussed failed galaxy UDGs.

Abstract: Bars, a common and important structure in disk galaxies, can be induced by
galaxy interactions. Although there have been some studies on bar formation in
flybys or collisions, the vast parameter space still leaves many scenarios that
require further investigation. Here, we focus on the role of collisions caused
by small galaxies (denoted as intruders), referred to as satellite collisions,
in bar formation for MW/M31-like galaxies (denoted as target galaxies).
Multiple sets of simulations with varying intruder initial velocities,
inclination angles, collision positions, and intruder masses were run to study
the dependence of this mechanism on these parameters. Our simulations show that
bar formation favors moderate collision velocity, large inclination angle,
off-center collision position, and large intruder mass. However, the bar's
pattern speed and length are insensitive to these parameters, as the intruder's
mass is relatively small compared to that of the target galaxy itself.
Moreover, based on our tests, the intruder mass should be more than $\sim
3\times10^{9}$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ in order for this bar formation mechanism to
operate effectively in MW/M31-like galaxies. Our work suggests the possibility
that satellite collisions may have contributed, to some extent, to the bar
formation in the Milky Way or M31.

Result: H$_2$S/OCS比例在暖核中呈现源间差异，分为OCS贫乏和OCS丰富两类原恒星，且该比例受云团初始条件和环境影响显著。

Abstract: Determining the amount of sulfur in volatiles and refractories in the ISM
remains one of the main problems in astrochemistry. The detection of H$_2$S
ices, which are thought to be one of the main sulfur reservoirs, has not been
achieved yet, and the only S-bearing species detected in the ices to date is
OCS. PRODIGE large survey observations with NOEMA of several Class 0/I
protostars in the Perseus Molecular Cloud provide a perfect opportunity to
study the H$_2$S and OCS composition of the ices through the volatiles
sublimated in the warm inner core (T$>$100K, n $\sim10^6$cm$^{-3}$) of these
protostars. Our aim is to determine the H$_2$S/OCS ratio in the warm inner core
of 24 protostars in order to study how it is affected by different factors
during its evolution. We used the NOEMA millimeter observations from the
PRODIGE program of H$_2$S, H$_2^{33}$S, OCS, OC$^{33}$S and OC$^{34}$S to
estimate the H$_2$S and OCS column densities in the warm inner cores. We used
SO and SO$_2$ data from the ALMA archive to give a rough estimate of the total
sulfur abundance. We explore the chemistry of H$_2$S and OCS in the warm cores
using chemical and dynamical simulations of the collapse of a dense core to
form a protostar. The estimated H$_2$S/OCS ratio reveals a segregation of the
sources into ``OCS-poor'' and ``OCS-rich'' protostars, where the OCS-poor
protostars present higher H$_2$S/OCS ratios than the OCS-rich ones. Total
sulfur abundance is always dominated by either H$_2$S or OCS, grows with
evolution during the Class 0 phase up to $D_S<8$, and decreases again in the
Class I. Simulations show that temperature changes in the pre-stellar phase and
during the collapse can produce substantial differences in the H$_2$S and OCS
abundances and in the H$_2$S/OCS ratio. Our analysis shows that the H$_2$S/OCS
ratio is strongly influenced by the environment and the initial conditions of
the cloud.

Background: 研究光解离区（PDRs）中芳香烃红外带（AIBs）的光谱特征及其载体（如多环芳烃）的光化学演化过程。

Data: 数据来源于PDRs4All JWST项目对猎户座分子云（Orion Bar）的观测以及星系NGC7469中心恒星形成环的光谱。

Method: 采用PAHFIT光谱分解工具分析AIB子成分、热尘埃辐射、气体谱线、恒星光和尘埃消光。

Abstract: Photodissociation regions (PDRs) exhibit emission between 3-20 um known as
the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs), originating from small carbonaceous species
such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The AIB spectra observed in
Galactic PDRs, such as the Orion Bar observations by the PDRs4All JWST program,
are considered a local analog for those seen in extragalactic star-forming
regions. We present the Python version of PAHFIT, a spectral decomposition tool
that separates the contributions by AIB subcomponents, thermal dust emission,
gas lines, stellar light, and dust extinction. By fitting segments of the Orion
Bar spectra, we provide a configuration to decompose JWST spectra of PDRs in
detail. The resulting central wavelengths and FWHM of the AIB subcomponents are
compiled into a "PDR pack" for PAHFIT.
  We applied PAHFIT with this PDR pack and the default continuum model to
spectra of the central star forming ring of the galaxy NGC7469. We introduce an
alternate dust continuum model to fit the Orion Bar spectra, as the default
PAHFIT continuum model mismatches the intensity at 15-26 um. PAHFIT fits with
the PDR pack and the alternate continuum model reproduce the Orion Bar spectra
with residuals of a few percent, and similar performance is achieved for the
NGC7469 spectra.
  We provide PAHFIT-based diagnostics that trace the profile variations of the
3.3, 3.4, 5.7, 6.2, and 7.7 um AIBs, and thus the photochemical evolution of
the AIB carriers. The 5.7 um AIB emission originates from at least two
subpopulations, one more prominent in highly irradiated environments and one
preferring more shielded environments. Smaller PAHs as well as very small
grains or PAH clusters both thrive in the more shielded environments of the
molecular zone in the Orion Bar. Based on these new diagnostics, we quantify
the similarities between the AIB profiles observed in the Orion Bar and
NGC7469.

Background: 研究星系恒星形成历史（SFH）的持续时间特征参数，超越平均恒星年龄的限制。

Data: 使用SEDlibrary软件创建复合星族（CSP）库，包含不同恒星形成历史、金属丰度和尘埃特性的模型，并基于500,000个模型的真实误差扰动生成模拟数据集。

Method: 采用贝叶斯统计方法比较观测与模型光谱特征，结合复合星族库分析星系恒星形成历史。

Result: 提出了量化星系恒星形成历史持续时间的新参数Deltaage_n，并确定了区分不同持续时间的最小分辨率Deltaage_n,min约为-0.3 dex。

Abstract: This project establishes parameters to characterize galaxy Star Formation
History (SFH) beyond mean stellar age. We use ages at which fixed star
fractions form to characterize SFH duration. We define Deltaage_n = (age_10 -
age_90)/age_50 for SFH extension, where age_10, age_90, age_50 correspond to
ages when 10%, 90%, and 50% of stars formed. Probability distributions for
observed galaxies use robust Bayesian statistics comparing observed and model
spectral features. We create composite stellar population (CSP) libraries using
SEDlibrary software, implementing varied SFH, metallicity, and dust properties.
We compare spectra using ten features: five spectral indices (D4000n,
[Hdelta+Hgamma], Hbeta, [Mg_2Fe], [MgFe]') and five SDSS ugriz photometric
fluxes. First, we focus on limiting Deltaage_n distinguishing extended from
negligible SFH duration, Deltaage_n,min (time resolution). Using idealized CSP
library of 5 million dust-free, burst-free models with fixed metallicities from
subsolar to supersolar, Deltaage_n,min marks where spectral features depend on
SFH duration. We find roughly flat log(Deltaage_n,min) around -0.3 dex over 4
magnitude orders in age. Deltaage_n,min decreases with higher SNR up to
SNR=100, beyond which no improvement occurs. Second, we create mock datasets by
perturbing 12,500 library models with realistic errors, testing retrieval
capability for characteristic ages and SFH duration using realistic
500,000-model CSP library with up to 6 starbursts, dust, and variable
metallicity. We constrain SFH duration log(Deltaage_n) within +-0.3 dex for
most samples. For populations with strong Balmer absorption and mean age <10^9
yr, uncertainty exceeds 0.5 dex due to SFH degeneracies. These parameters will
apply to current and upcoming deep spectroscopic galaxy surveys.

Abstract: In the light of new full-sky surveys, many attempts of creating a consistent
Galactic model were made. The main interest is to estimate the still poorly
understood dark matter content. However, the results vary depending on
methodology, assumptions, and baryonic distribution used. To understand this
discrepancy, we take the first step by estimating the model-free local mass
density of stars and stellar remnants. We use a complete sample from the Gaia
Catalogue of Nearby Stars within 100 pc from the Sun, together with the data on
the sample of the White Dwarfs and the recent estimate of the Neutron Stars
concentration in the solar neighborhood. After correction for unresolved binary
stars and accounting for missing low-mass stars, we find the local mass density
of stars and stellar remnants in the solar neighborhood is $\rho_{100} =
0.040^{+0.012} _{ -0.006}M_\odot pc^{-3}$ with Kroupa IMF, and $\rho_{100} =
0.037^{+0.012}_{ -0.006}M_\odot pc^{-3}$ with Chabrier IMF.

Abstract: The detection of high gas-phase abundances of SO2 and SO in the cold envelope
of an intermediate mass protostar suggests that these molecules might form on
icy dust grains and subsequently desorb to the gas phase by non-thermal
desorption processes such as photodesorption. In this work we report
photodesorption yields for SO2 and, tentatively, SO upon ultraviolet photon
irradiation of SO2 ice samples at temperatures between 14 and 80 K.
Photodesorption yields were measured directly in the gas phase using a
calibrated quadrupole mass spectrometer. Yields of 2.3 x 10-4 molecule/photon
and 6 x 10-5 molecule/photon were estimated for SO2 and SO at 14 K
(respectively). The SO2 photodesorption yield increased with temperature up to
a value of 3.8 x 10-4 molecule/photon at 70 K, followed by a decrease at 80 K
that could be due to crystallization of the sample. The signal assigned to SO
photodesorption did not significantly change with temperature. The estimated
photodesorption yields were included in the Nautilus gas-grain chemical model
to evaluate their contribution to the SO2 and SO gas-phase abundances in an
astrophysical environment. In addition, we also present a theoretically
estimated band strength for the 1395 cm-1 SO3 IR feature (A = 1.1 x 10-16 cm
molecule-1). SO3 is the main detected product in irradiated SO2 ices, and a
potential contributor to the 7.2 um band observed in some interstellar ice IR
spectra.

Result: 极化-形态错位角随红移增加显著恶化，且在固定观测频率下高红移星系因源帧频率降低而减少法拉第退偏振效应。

Abstract: In star-forming disk galaxies, the radio continuum emission (1-10 GHz)
powered by star formation has an integral polarization direction imperfectly
aligned with the apparent disk minor axis. This polarization-shape alignment
effect was previously observed in a small sample of local spirals. If this is
prevalent for disk galaxies out to cosmological redshifts, novel measurements
of cosmic birefringence and cosmic shear will be enabled by leveraging radio
continuum surveys such as the Square Kilometre Array synergized with galaxy
shape measurements. We calculate the polarization-shape misalignment angle for
star-forming galaxies in the IllustrisTNG50 simulation at 0 < z < 2, assuming
that additional polarized radio emission from an active galactic nucleus is
negligible in at least a sizable fraction of the star-forming galaxies. The
alignment found for z = 0 is consistent with local spiral data, but
significantly deteriorates as redshift increases. Moreover, it degrades toward
lower frequencies due to internal Faraday depolarization. Thanks to cosmic
redshifting, observing higher-z galaxies at a fixed frequency greatly mitigates
degradation due to reduced Faraday depolarization at the source-frame
frequency. We present analytic fits to the non-Gaussian misalignment angle
distribution, and evaluate Fisher information per galaxy for measuring a
polarization rotation angle induced by cosmic birefringence. For observation at
4.8 GHz, the effective root-mean-square misalignment angle is 18{\deg},
23{\deg}, and 33{\deg} at z = 0, 1 and 2, respectively. As accurate
observation-driven models are not yet available for cosmological galaxy
samples, our results motivate pilot observations to empirically characterize
polarization-shape alignment, and can facilitate forecasts of cosmology and
fundamental physics applications that exploit this effect.

Result: 在Draco弥散云中，HI-H2转变发生在Av=0.33（N=6.2e20 cm^-2）处，对应两个对数正态分布分量贡献相等的点。

Abstract: In recent decades, significant attention has been dedicated to analytical and
observational studies of the atomic hydrogen (HI) to molecular hydrogen (H2)
transition in the interstellar medium. We focussed on the Draco diffuse cloud
to gain deeper insights into the physical properties of the transition from HI
to H2. We employed the total hydrogen column density probability distribution
function (N-PDF) derived from Herschel dust observations and the N(HI)-PDF
obtained from HI data collected by the Effelsberg HI survey. The N-PDF of the
Draco cloud exhibits a double-log-normal distribution, whereas the N(HI)-PDF
follows a single log-normal distribution. The HI-to-H2 transition is identified
as the point where the two log-normal components of the dust N-PDF contribute
equally; it occurs at Av = 0.33 (N=6.2e20 cm^-2). The low-column-density
segment of the dust N-PDF corresponds to the cold neutral medium, which is
characterized by a temperature of around 100 K. The higher-column-density part
is predominantly associated with H2. The shape of the Draco N-PDF is
qualitatively reproduced by numerical simulations. In the absence of
substantial stellar feedback, such as radiation or stellar winds, turbulence
exerts a significant influence on the thermal stability of the gas and can
regulate the condensation of gas into denser regions and its subsequent
evaporation. Recent observations of the ionized carbon line at 158 micron in
Draco support this scenario. Using the KOSMA-tau photodissociation model, we
estimate a gas density of n=50 cm^-3 and a temperature of 100 K at the location
of the HI-to-H2 transition. Both the molecular and atomic gas components are
characterized by supersonic turbulence and strong mixing, suggesting that
simplified steady-state chemical models are not applicable under these
conditions.

Background: 研究背景聚焦于核区暂现源的多波段观测及其与超大质量黑洞吸积活动（如潮汐瓦解事件）和极端冕线发射现象的关联。

Data: 数据来源于SRG/eROSITA全天巡天观测（eRASS1和eRASS2）、多波段时域广域设施的光变曲线以及后续光学光谱观测。

Method: 采用多波段光变曲线分析和后续光学光谱观测技术。

Abstract: The nuclear transient eRASSt J012026.5-292727 (J012026 hereafter) was
discovered in the second SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS2). The source
appeared more than one order of magnitude brighter than the eRASS1 upper limits
(peak eRASS2 0.2-2.3 keV flux of 1.14 x 10^-12 erg cm^-2 s^-1), and with a soft
X-ray spectrum (photon index Gamma = 4.3). Over the following months, the X-ray
flux started decaying, with significant flaring activity on both hour- and
year-timescales. By inspecting the multiwavelength light curves of time-domain
wide-field facilities, we detected a strong mid-infrared flare, evolving over 2
years, and a weaker optical counterpart. Follow-up optical spectroscopy
revealed transient features, including redshifted Balmer lines (FWHM ~1500
km/s), strong Fe II emission, He II and Bowen lines, and high-ionization iron
coronal lines. One spectrum showed a triple-peaked H-beta line, consistent with
emission from a face-on elliptical disk. The spectroscopic features and the
slow evolution of the event place J012026 within the classifications of Bowen
fluorescence flares (BFFs) and extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs). BFFs have
been associated with rejuvenated accreting SMBHs, although the mechanism
triggering the onset of the new accretion flow is still unclear, while ECLEs
have been linked to the disruption of stars in gas-rich environments. The
association of J012026 to both classes, combined with the multi-wavelength
information, suggests that BFFs could be, at least in some cases, due to tidal
disruption events (TDEs). The observed X-ray variability, uncommon in standard
TDEs, adds complexity to these families of nuclear transients. These results
highlight the diverse phenomenology of nuclear accretion events and demonstrate
the value of systematic X-ray surveys, such as eROSITA and Einstein Probe, for
uncovering such transients and characterizing their physical origin.

*Mauro Bernardini,Robert Feldmann,Daniel Anglés-Alcázar,Philipp Denzel,Jindra Gensior*

**TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于EMBER-2模型的数据驱动方法，在z=6-0红移范围内准确重建了中性氢与暗物质在100 h/cMpc尺度下的密度互相关关系，精度达10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 探索下一代射电望远镜观测中性氢分布与弱引力透镜数据结合以约束暗物质性质的科学挑战。

Data: 使用FIRE-2运行宇宙学星系形成模拟数据训练EMBER-2模型。

Method: 采用EMBER-2模型从场级层面学习中性氢与暗物质的映射关系。

Result: 通过EMBER-2模型实现了中性氢与暗物质在红移z=6-0范围内的场级映射，将交叉密度相关重构精度提升至k=100 h/cMpc尺度的10%。

Abstract: Next-generation radio telescopes will provide unprecedented data volumes of
the neutral hydrogen (HI) distribution across cosmic time. Combining weak
lensing surveys with spatial and kinematic observations of HI could help
constrain key properties of dark matter, such as its mass, clustering behavior,
and spatial distribution. However, inferring dark matter properties from HI
observations is challenging because of processes related to galaxy formation,
such as stellar feedback. Methods that use empirical relations, often
calibrated via numerical simulations, do not use full field-level information
to model the complex relation between dark matter and HI. We address this
shortcoming with a data-driven approach, leveraging the recently introduced
EMBER-2 model to learn the HI-dark matter mapping at the field level for a wide
redshift range, z=6-0. After training on cosmological galaxy formation
simulations run with FIRE-2, EMBER-2 accurately recovers key statistics,
including dark matter mass fractions and surface density profiles. The HI-dark
matter density cross-correlation is reconstructed at an accuracy of 10% down to
scales of k = 100 h/cMpc, a significant improvement over traditional
approaches. The presented method may become a key ingredient in future
inference pipelines as it can be readily integrated into downstream analysis
tasks of radio surveys.

**TL;DR**: 研究发现超大质量暗星坍缩形成的超大质量黑洞可能是纳赫兹引力波背景的主要来源，其种子数密度约为每立方兆秒差距10^-3个时贡献最大，而直接坍缩黑洞的贡献较小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 早期宇宙中超大质量黑洞的存在对传统形成机制提出了挑战。

Data: 数据来源于脉冲星计时阵列（PTAs）探测到的纳赫兹引力波背景以及数值模拟中直接坍缩黑洞（DCBHs）和超质量暗星（SMDSs）的种子数密度。

Method: 采用早期超大质量黑洞种子形成机制（直接坍缩黑洞和超质量暗星坍缩）计算对脉冲星计时阵列信号的影响。

Result: 超大质量暗星坍缩形成的超大质量黑洞可能是PTA信号的主要来源。

Abstract: The growing evidence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) being present in the
early Universe poses challenges to their traditional formation pathways.
Separately, studies suggest that merging SMBH binaries with total masses
$\gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ could be the primary sources of the nanohertz
gravitational wave background detected by the Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs).
Owing to their extreme masses, these SMBHs have a higher probability of forming
earlier than their lower-mass counterparts. In this work, we provide a
formalism to calculate the implications of early seeded SMBHs for the PTA
signal. As an application, we explore the two most prominent scenarios of
high-$z$ SMBHs seeding mechanisms: direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) and
collapse of supermassive dark stars (SMDSs). We show that SMDS-seeded SMBHs,
with comoving seed number density of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \, {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$
can be the dominant contributor to the PTA signal, with mass $> 10^9 M_\odot$
binaries acquiring a peak merger rate at $z< 1$. By contrast, SMBHs seeded via
the DCBH channel may contribute only sub-dominantly unless produced with a much
larger number density than implied by numerical simulations. Our analysis
further suggests that the seed number density should be $< \mathcal{O}(10^{-1})
\, {\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ in order to not over-predict the expected PTA signal.

**TL;DR**: 利用积分视场光谱技术分析12个行星状星云中的铁和镍发射线，发现16个富铁镍团块，提出新的激波/光电离判别标准，并证实部分铁镍仍存在于尘埃颗粒中。

Background: 利用积分视场光谱技术研究行星状星云中铁和镍发射线的激发机制及元素丰度分布。

Data: 使用MUSE积分视场单元（IFU）数据对12个行星状星云（PNe）中的铁和镍发射线进行了分析。

Method: 采用积分视场光谱技术结合机器学习算法分析铁和镍发射线，利用PyNeb包估算电子密度和元素丰度，并建立新的激波/光电离选择标准。

Result: 在12个行星状星云中检测到16个富含铁和镍的团块，其丰度低于太阳值，表明部分铁和镍仍存在于尘埃颗粒中。

Abstract: Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) offers a distinct advantage for studying
extended sources by enabling spatially resolved emission maps for several
emission lines without the need for specific filters. This study conducts a
detailed analysis of iron and nickel emission lines in 12 planetary nebulae
(PNe) using integral field unit (IFU) data from MUSE to provide insights into
their formation and evolution mechanisms. New diagnostic line ratios, combined
with machine-learning algorithms, were used to distinguish excitation
mechanisms such as shock and photoionization. Electron densities and elemental
abundances were estimated using different atomic data through the PyNeb
package. The contribution of fluorescent excitation of nickel lines was also
examined. A total of 16 iron- and nickel-rich clumps are detected in seven out
of 12 PNe. New clumps are discovered in NGC 3132 and IC 4406. The most
prominent lines are [Fe II] 8617 Angstrom and [Ni II] 7378 Angstrom. Both
emission lines are observed emanating directly from the low-ionization
structures (LIS) of NGC 3242, NGC 7009, and NGC 6153, as well as from clumps in
NGC 6369 and Tc 1. Their abundances are found to be below solar values,
indicating that a fraction of Fe and Ni remains depleted in dust grains. The
depletion factors exhibit a strong correlation over a wide range. A
machine-learning approach allows us to classify ten out of 16 clumps as
shock-excited and to establish a new shock/photoionization selection criterion:
log([Ni II] 7378 Angstrom / H-alpha) and log([Fe II] 8617 Angstrom / H-alpha)
greater than -2.20.

**TL;DR**: 通过双星合成模拟和观测数据对比，发现中等质量AGB星通过风Roche瓣溢流将锂转移至主序星是形成锂富集红巨星的主要机制，但无法解释所有观测现象，暗示存在其他富集途径。

Background: 研究探讨了红巨星中锂富集现象的起源机制，重点关注双星系统中的物质转移过程。

Data: 数据来源于GALAH巡天观测的富锂巨星和利用COSMIC代码模拟的900万组双星系统演化。

Method: 采用二元星族合成代码COSMIC模拟900万组双星系统演化，结合GALAH观测数据，通过恒星模型核合成产量分析，重点考察中等质量AGB星（4.25-8M⊙）风罗希瓣溢流低效传质（1%效率）对红巨星锂增丰的影响。

Result: 通过演化900万双星系统发现，观测约束最吻合的锂富集红巨星形成机制是中等质量AGB星向主序星的质量转移。

Abstract: Surface lithium is depleted when a star goes through the first dredge-up
phase, yet $1\%$ of red giants are found to be Li-rich. The formation mechanism
for these remains uncertain. We combine observational constraints from GALAH
Li-rich giants, with the binary population synthesis code COSMIC to investigate
system properties of these objects assuming binary mass transfer. By evolving 9
million binary systems, we find that binary histories most consistent with
observational constraints are mass transfer from an intermediate-mass AGB donor
to a main-sequence star now observed as a Li-rich red giant. In GALAH, $9\%$ of
main-sequence stars have $\rm A(Li)=2.5-3.2$ dex making it plausible to create
red giants with $\rm A(Li)=1.5-2.2 \; dex$ via main-sequence mass transfer, but
cannot explain the more enriched giants $\rm A(Li) \gtrsim 2.2 \; dex$.
Nucleosynthetic yields from stellar models show that AGB stars with initial
masses of $4.25-5 \; \rm M_\odot$ and $8 \; \rm M_\odot$ contain the most Li in
their ejecta. Intermediate-mass AGB stars comprise $29\%$ of COSMIC results,
with present-day separations $s=3.3\pm0.5 \rm \; AU$ and mass ratios
$q=0.5-1.6$. We achieve $95\%$ agreement in mean enhancements in $\rm (Ba, Y)$
between GALAH observations and stellar models of 6 and $8 \rm \; M_\odot$ AGB,
assuming $1\%$ mass transfer efficiency. We find a low mass transfer efficiency
best reproduces GALAH observations suggesting that the preferred mass transfer
mechanism for Li-enrichment is via wind Roche Lobe Overflow. While we constrain
the most plausible binary parameters assuming AGB mass transfer creates Li-rich
giants, discrepancies in nucleosynthesis comparisons, and the small fraction of
Li-enhanced main-sequence stars suggests additional enrichment mechanisms are
likely.

**TL;DR**: 观测超新星SN2024ggi发现其红外波段明亮且发射线宽度一致，表明内抛射物在2000km/s以下存在高效宏观化学混合，但56Ni混合较少，CO分子辐射占总光度5%，原子和离子辐射占主导，稳定镍产物普遍存在于大质量恒星爆发。

Background: 研究超新星SN2024ggi的光学和红外辐射特征及其化学元素混合机制。

Method: 基于标准红超巨星爆炸模型的无分子辐射转移模拟。

Result: SN2024ggi的观测表明内抛射物在小于2000km/s速度下实现了高效的宏观化学混合，且56Ni在更高速度下混合较少。

Abstract: We present 0.3-21mic observations at ~275d and ~400d for Type II supernova
(SN) 2024ggi, combining ground-based optical and near-infrared data from the
Keck I/II telescopes and space-based infrared data from the James Webb Space
Telescope. Although the optical regions dominate the observed flux, SN2024ggi
is bright at infrared wavelengths (65%/35% falls each side of 1mic). SN2024ggi
exhibits a plethora of emission lines from H, He, intermediate-mass elements
(O, Na, Mg, S, Ar, Ca), and iron-group elements (IGEs; Fe, Co, and Ni) -- all
lines have essentially the same width, suggesting efficient macroscopic
chemical mixing of the inner ejecta at <~2000km/s and little mixing of 56Ni at
larger velocities. Molecular emission in the infrared range is dominated by the
CO fundamental, which radiates about 5% of the total SN luminosity. A
molecule-free radiative-transfer model based on a standard red-supergiant star
explosion (i.e., ~1e51erg, 0.06Msun of 56Ni from a 15.2Msun progenitor) yields
a satisfactory match throughout the optical and infrared at both epochs. The
SN2024ggi CO luminosity is comparable to the fractional decay-power absorbed in
the model C/O-rich shell -- accounting for CO cooling would likely resolve the
model overestimate of the [OI]0.632mic flux. The relative weakness of the
molecular emission in SN2024ggi and the good overall match obtained with our
molecule-free model suggests negligible microscopic mixing -- about 95% of the
SN luminosity is radiated by atoms and ions. Lines from IGEs, which form from
explosion ashes at such late times, are ideal diagnostics of the magnitude of
56Ni mixing in core-collapse SN ejecta. Stable Ni, clearly identified in
SN2024ggi (e.g., [NiII]6.634mic), is probably a common product of massive-star
explosions.

Result: 发现两类磁白矮星分别通过不同机制形成：年轻高质量天体具有强磁场源于并合起源，而年老平均质量天体具有弱磁场源于结晶诱导发电机或主序阶段核心对流发电机。

Abstract: We conduct a model atmosphere analysis on all magnetic white dwarfs in the
SDSS 100 pc sample. We have 163 magnetic targets in this sample, 87 of which
are new discoveries, making this the largest volume-limited survey of magnetic
white dwarfs to date. We discuss the distribution of multiple parameters,
including mass, cooling age, and field strength. We find strong evidence of two
populations of magnetic white dwarfs that form through separate mechanisms
based on a cluster analysis of these parameters. The young, high mass objects
typically have high field strengths which indicate a merger origin, while old,
average mass objects have weaker fields that likely originated through a
crystallization-induced dynamo or previous evolution stages. When comparing
young and old objects, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests yield statistically
significant differences between the field strengths and masses of the magnetic
targets. We use a Gaussian mixture model to identify where these populations
lie in parameter space, and we find two groups centered at distinct cooling
ages, masses, and field strengths: 2.9 Gyr, 0.71 $M_{\odot}$, 3.7 MG and 1.8
Gyr, 0.96 $M_{\odot}$, 84 MG respectively. Our results further support the dual
formation channel previously reported in the literature. The occurrence of
magnetism strongly correlates with the onset of crystallization. However, given
the breakout times required for a crystallization dynamo, we find that many of
our older, average mass objects can be better explained with a core-convective
dynamo that forms on the main-sequence.

Result: 首次发现来自银河系厚盘的星际天体3I/ATLAS，其速度和辐射点符合预期，推测具有较高水含量。

Abstract: The discovery of the third interstellar object (ISO), 3I/ATLAS (`3I'),
provides a rare chance to directly observe a small body from another Solar
System. Studying its chemistry and dynamics will add to our understanding of
how the processes of planetesimal formation and evolution happen across the
Milky Way's disk, and how such objects respond to the Milky Way's potential. In
this Letter, we present a first assessment of 3I in the context of the
\={O}tautahi-Oxford model, which uses data from Gaia in conjunction with models
of protoplanetary disk chemistry and Galactic dynamics to predict the
properties of the ISO population. The model shows that both the velocity and
radiant of 3I are within the expected range. Its velocity suggests an origin
within the Milky Way's thick disk, making it the first ISO from this
population, and predicts a high water mass fraction, which may become
observable shortly. We also conclude that it is very unlikely that 3I shares an
origin with either of the previous two interstellar object detections.

Result: 3I/ATLAS可能是一个核心半径小于0.6公里的彗星，或属于数量密度低于5×10^-8 au^-3（半径<10公里）的稀有天体群。

Abstract: The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS shows a weak cometary activity. Its
brightness suggests a maximum radius of ~10km (A/0.05)^{-1/2} for an asteroid
with an albedo A. I show that interstellar objects with that radius would
amount to an interstellar mass density that is well above the expected mass
budget of interstellar comets or asteroids. Given this budget, the detection
rate of objects like 3I/ATLAS implies that it is a comet with a small core
radius <0.6km, or a member of a rare population with a number density
<5x10^{-8}au^{-3}} for R<10km. The second possibility would suggest that the
rare population of 3I/ATLAS objects favors plunging orbits towards the inner
solar system to accommodate their inferred detection rate.
