**TL;DR**: ALMA-CRISTAL survey通过多波长观测研究了4到6红移范围内的恒星形成星系的气体、尘埃和恒星结构，揭示了多样化的形态和动力学特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前对高红移恒星形成星系物理性质的研究仍存在不足，特别是在气体、尘埃和恒星结构的空间分辨观测方面。ALMA-CRISTAL survey旨在填补这一空白，通过多波长观测提供更详细的视角。

Data: 使用了ALMA Band 7观测的[CII] 158微米线发射和尘埃连续谱数据，以及JWST/NIRCam和HST成像数据来绘制恒星和紫外发射。

Method: 通过ALMA Band 7观测研究[CII] 158微米线发射和尘埃连续谱，并结合JWST/NIRCam和HST成像数据进行多波长分析。

Result: 研究发现星系表现出多样化的形态和动力学特征，包括旋转盘、合并系统、[CII]发射尾和团块状恒星形成。此外，[CII]发射在许多情况下超出了HST和JWST成像中的恒星光范围，且[CII]/FIR比率随FIR光度增加而降低，但高红移星系表现出更高的[CII]/FIR比率。

Abstract: We present the ALMA-CRISTAL survey, an ALMA Cycle 8 Large Program designed to
investigate the physical properties of star-forming galaxies at $4 \lesssim z
\lesssim 6$ through spatially resolved, multi-wavelength observations. This
survey targets 19 star-forming main-sequence galaxies selected from the ALPINE
survey, using ALMA Band 7 observations to study [CII] 158 $\mu$m line emission
and dust continuum, complemented by JWST/NIRCam and HST imaging to map stellar
and UV emission. The CRISTAL sample expanded to 39 after including newly
detected galaxies in the CRISTAL fields, archival data, and pilot study
targets. The resulting dataset provides a detailed view of gas, dust, and
stellar structures on kiloparsec scales at the end of the era of reionization.
The survey reveals diverse morphologies and kinematics, including rotating
disks, merging systems, [CII] emission tails from potential interactions, and
clumpy star formation. Notably, the [CII] emission in many cases extends beyond
the stellar light seen in HST and JWST imaging. Scientific highlights include
CRISTAL-10, exhibiting an extreme [CII] deficit similar to Arp 220; and
CRISTAL-13, where feedback from young star-forming clumps likely causes an
offset between the stellar clumps and the peaks of [CII] emission. CRISTAL
galaxies exhibit global [CII]/FIR ratios that decrease with increasing FIR
luminosity, similar to trends seen in local galaxies but shifted to higher
luminosities, likely due to their higher molecular gas content. CRISTAL
galaxies also span a previously unexplored range of global FIR surface
brightness at high-redshift, showing that high-redshift galaxies can have
elevated [CII]/FIR ratios. These elevated ratios are likely influenced by
factors such as lower metallicity gas, the presence of significant extraplanar
gas, and contributions from shock-excited gas.

Abstract: Non-spherical potentials allow a wide range of trajectories, both regular and
chaotic, whose periapse distances can vary orbit to orbit. In particular
chaotic trajectories can bring a system arbitrarily close to the central
massive black hole leading to a disruption. In this paper, we work with an
observationally benchmarked model of the innermost 200 pc of the Milky Way and
show that low z-angular momentum trajectories are commonly chaotic. We compute
the timescales and properties of close pericenter passages, and compare the
implied collisionless disruption rate to the well-studied collisional rate from
2-body scatterings. We find that the relative collisionless rate can dominate
by orders of magnitude. Our calculations are relevant for a wide range of
disruption phenomena, including the production of hypervelocity stars (HVSs)
and tidal disruption events (TDEs). Most of these disruptions involve stars
come from the Nuclear Stellar Cluster, with a pericenter distribution that
strongly favours shallow encounters, and a preference for high inclination
interactions. The latter implies that unbound disrupted material - whether
ejected stars or stellar debris - would be preferentially directed towards the
galactic poles. Many of our conclusions apply generally to any galaxy with a
non-spherical galactic centre potential and central massive black hole.

Background: 高红移致密恒星团的形成、演化物理过程及其与现今球状星团的联系是星系形成领域的关键问题。

Data: 研究使用SIEGE项目的宇宙学放大模拟数据，聚焦于一个红移为6.14、维里质量为几乘以10的9次方太阳质量的矮星系。

Abstract: The formation of compact high-redshift star-forming clumps, the physical
processes driving their evolution and their potential connection to present-day
Globular Clusters are key open questions in galaxy formation. In this work, we
aim to shed light on these aspects using the SImulating the Environment where
Globular clusters Emerged (SIEGE) project, a suite of cosmological zoom-in
simulations with sub-parsec resolution specifically designed to investigate the
physical conditions behind the origin of compact stellar systems in
high-redshift environments. The simulation object of this study focuses on a
dwarf galaxy with a virial mass of a few $10^9$ $M_\odot$ at $z=6.14$, where
the spatial resolution reaches 0.3 pc $h^{-1}$. Individual stars are formed
directly by sampling the initial mass function with a 100\% star formation
efficiency, a setup designed to explore the impact of a high star formation
efficiency under high-redshift conditions. The simulation reveals the emergence
of numerous stellar clumps with sizes of 1-3 pc, stellar surface densities up
to almost $10^4$ $M_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, and masses predominantly spanning from
$10^3$ $M_\odot$ to several $10^4$ $M_\odot$, with a few reaching $10^5$
$M_\odot$ and up to $10^6$ $M_\odot$. All clumps form during intense, short
bursts of star formation lasting less than a Myr, often with negligible dark
matter content (dark-to-stellar mass ratios below 1 within three times their
effective radii). We measure a clear correlation between mass and size, and a
clump mass function described by a power-law with a slope of -2. Star formation
conditions in the simulation behave similarly to those of a feedback-free
starburst scenario, where dense clumps form due to inefficient stellar feedback
over small timescales. Notably, some clumps exhibit properties closely
resembling those of present-day globular clusters.

**TL;DR**: JWST观测发现高红移（z>3）的大质量静止星系（MQGs）数量远超理论模型预测，GS-9209的动力学分析表明其具有高旋转支持，挑战了主要通过干并合形成MQGs的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: JWST观测揭示了大量红移z>3的大质量静止星系（MQGs），这些星系的数量密度远超理论模型的预测，表明早期暗物质晕中重子转化为恒星的效率极高。

Data: 使用JWST/NIRSpec积分场光谱仪对红移z=4.66的大质量紧凑静止星系GS-9209进行了高分辨率观测。

Method: 通过恒星运动学分析，包括全光谱拟合和Jeans各向异性建模（JAM），结合NFW轮廓，研究了GS-9209的动力学特性。

Result: GS-9209显示出明显的旋转模式（λ_Reff=0.65±0.12），暗物质分数为6.3^{+2.8}_{-1.7}%，其结构类似于低红移的‘遗迹’星系，但恒星质量-光比与银河系类似IMF一致。

Abstract: JWST observations uncovered a large number of massive quiescent galaxies
(MQGs) at z>3, which theoretical models struggle to reproduce. Explaining the
number density of such objects requires extremely high conversion efficiency of
baryons into stars in early dark matter halos. Using stellar kinematics, we can
investigate the processes shaping the mass assembly histories of MQGs. We
present high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy of GS-9209, a
massive, compact quiescent galaxy at z=4.66 ($\log \left (M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}
\right) = 10.52 \pm 0.06 $, $R_{eff} = 220 \pm 20$ pc). Full spectral fitting
of the spatially resolved stellar continuum reveals a clear rotational pattern,
yielding a spin parameter of $\lambda_{R_{eff}} = 0.65 \pm 0.12$. With its high
degree of rotational support, this galaxy challenges the scenario of MQGs
growing mainly by dry major mergers. This study suggests that at least a
fraction of the earliest quiescent galaxies were fast rotators and that
quenching was dynamically gentle process, preserving the stellar disc even in
highly compact objects. Using Jeans anisotropic modelling (JAM) and a NFW
profile, we measure a dark matter fraction of $f_{\rm DM} \left (< R_{eff}
\right ) = 6.3^{+2.8}_{-1.7}%$, which is plausible given that this galaxy is
extremely compact. Our findings use kinematics to independently confirm the
massive nature of early quiescent galaxies, previously inferred from stellar
population modelling. We suggest that GS-9209 has a similar structure to
low-redshift 'relic' galaxies. However, unlike relic galaxies which have
bottom-heavy initial mass functions (IMF), the dynamically inferred stellar
mass-to-light ratio of GS-9209 is consistent with a Milky-Way like IMF. The
kinematical properties of GS-9209 are different from those of z<1 early-type
galaxies and more similar to those of recently quenched post-starburst galaxies
at z>2.

Abstract: During the epoch of reionization (EoR), the first generation of luminous
sources in our Universe emitted ionizing photons that almost completely ionized
the gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM). The growth of ionized bubbles and
the persistence of neutral islands within the IGM hold vital clues to
understanding the morphology and timeline of cosmic reionization. We explore
the potential of photometric IGM tomography using deep narrow-band (NB) imaging
to observe the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest transmission in background galaxies with
the Subaru/Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC). Based on our simulations, we find that the
currently available NB filter is suitable for mapping the IGM at $z\simeq 5.7$,
corresponding to the late stages of reionization. Our findings indicate that
over $\sim$500 background galaxies are needed to accurately reconstruct the IGM
at scales greater than 200 Mpc, achieving more than 40 per cent correlation
with the true distribution. This technique can help detect final remaining
neutral islands that span more than 20 Mpc lengths. Using the superpixel method
built to identify physical patterns in noisy image data, we find that the
neutral island size distribution can be recovered with an accuracy of $\sim$0.3
dex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these reconstructed maps are correlated
with the galaxy distribution and anti-correlated with the cosmological 21-cm
signal from neutral hydrogen in the IGM. Lastly, we find that these
reconstructed maps are anti-correlated with the patchy optical depth to the
cosmic microwave background. As such, multiple measurements can be employed for
confirmed detection of neutral islands during the end stages.

### [6] [JWST/NIRSpec Observations of High Ionization Emission Lines in Galaxies at High Redshift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06359)
*Mengtao Tang,Daniel P. Stark,Adèle Plat,Anna Feltre,Harley Katz,Peter Senchyna,Charlotte A. Mason,Lily Whitler,Zuyi Chen,Michael W. Topping*

**TL;DR**: JWST spectroscopy reveals narrow high ionization lines in a small subset of galaxies at z>4, suggesting the presence of hard radiation fields and potential nitrogen-enhancement or resonant scattering effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Current JWST spectroscopy has identified large emission line samples at z≳4 but lacks confident detections of galaxies with hard radiation fields typical of AGN photoionization, possibly due to weaker UV ionizing spectra or obscuration by dense neutral gas and dust.

Data: 53 new galaxies observed with NIRSpec R=2700 grating spectroscopy, and a database of 851 NIRSpec grating spectra.

Method: NIRSpec R=2700 grating spectroscopy to characterize high ionization lines, with analysis of NV/CIV and NV/HeII ratios.

Result: Narrow NV emission detected in two galaxies, indicating hard radiation fields in a small subset of LRDs (12.5+23.7−10.4%) and UV-selected galaxies (2.2+1.7−1.0%) at z>4, with implications for nitrogen-enhancement and resonant scattering effects.

Abstract: JWST spectroscopy has built large emission line samples at $z\gtrsim4$, but
it has yet to confidently reveal many galaxies with the hard radiation fields
commonly associated with AGN photoionization. While this may indicate a weaker
UV ionizing spectrum in many $z>4$ AGNs or obscuration from dense neutral gas
and dust, the complete picture remains unclear owing to the small number of
deep rest-UV spectra. Here we characterize the strength of high ionization
lines in $53$ new galaxies observed with NIRSpec $R=2700$ grating spectroscopy.
We present new detections of narrow NV$\lambda1240$ in two galaxies. One is a
previously-confirmed $z=6.98$ Little Red Dot (LRD) with broad H$\beta$, and the
other is a $z=8.72$ galaxy with a narrow line spectrum. Neither source exhibits
CIV or HeII emission, indicating large NV/CIV and NV/HeII ratios that may
reflect a combination of nitrogen-enhancement and resonant scattering effects.
We investigate the incidence of narrow high ionization lines in a large
database of $851$ NIRSpec grating spectra, and we separately quantify the
fraction of LRDs with narrow high ionization UV emission lines. Our results
likely suggest that hard radiation fields are indeed present in a small subset
of LRDs ($12.5^{+23.7}_{-10.4}\%$) and UV-selected galaxies
($2.2^{+1.7}_{-1.0}\%$) at $z>4$. The identification of narrow high ionization
lines in the population of LRDs with strong Balmer absorption suggests the
dense neutral hydrogen gas may not uniformly cover the nucleus. The NV/CIV and
NV/HeII ratios suggest that efforts to identify high ionization lines should
extend down in wavelength to the NV doublet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域需要一种能够无缝连接动力学理论描述、N体模拟和观测数据紧凑描述的方法，EXP填补了这一空白。

Method: EXP采用基函数展开方法分解星系的多尺度几何结构，并结合非参数时间序列分析技术。

Result: EXP能够自动从模拟中发现动力学信号，并提供完整的在线文档和示例教程以降低学习门槛。

Abstract: We present the public release of EXP, a basis function expansion C++ library
and Python package for running N-body galactic simulations and dynamical
discovery. EXP grew out of the need for methodology that seamlessly connects
theoretical descriptions of dynamics, N-body simulations, and compact
descriptions of observed data. EXP decomposes a galaxy into multiple bases for
a variety of scales and geometries and is thus able to represent arbitrarily
complex simulations with many components (e.g., disk, bulge, dark matter halo,
satellites). pyEXP provides a full Python interface to the EXP C++ libraries.
Example workflows based on previously published work are available and
distributed as accompanying examples and tutorials. The examples and tutorials
flatten the learning curve for adopting basis function expansion tools to
generate and analyze the significance of coefficients and discover dynamical
relationships using time series analysis. The current release uses a powerful,
non-parametric technique for time series analysis that decomposes basis
function expansion coefficients into interpretable components without assuming
a specific model structure. This enables the automated discovery of dynamical
signals from simulations. We provide a full online manual hosted by Read the
Docs.

**TL;DR**: 研究探讨了法拉第旋转测量（RM）与湍流等离子体中未解析结构的微分法拉第旋转之间的关系，发现RM抖动与法拉第深度分辨率无关，且对高偏振源的RM散射影响较小。


<details>

Background: 目前对湍流等离子体中法拉第旋转测量（RM）与未解析结构的关系尚不清楚，研究旨在填补这一空白，并探讨RM抖动对RM网格应用的意义。

Data: 使用了受湍流法拉第屏影响的射电源样本数据，以及Vanderwoude等人（2024年）的研究数据。

Method: 通过模拟通量密度限制样本，假设所有源均由湍流法拉第屏引起去偏振，分析了RM抖动与法拉第深度结构功率谱的关系。

Result: 研究发现，RM抖动与法拉第深度分辨率无关，且对高偏振源的RM散射影响较小，表明近源环境以外的等离子体对高偏振源的RM散射起主导作用。

Abstract: The relation between Faraday Rotation Measure (RM) and differential Faraday
rotation by unresolved structure of a turbulent plasma is investigated for
extragalactic radio sources. The RM scatter of a sample of sources affected by
turbulent Faraday screens with identical power spectra of Faraday depth
structure, is referred to as RM jitter. For fixed amplitude and slope of the
power spectrum, the range of possible RMs depends on the wavelength coverage of
the survey. RM jitter is independent of Faraday depth resolution as it results
from the true Faraday depth dispersion and effects of wavelength-dependent
depolarization. RM jitter for a flux density limited sample is sensitive to the
power law index gamma of the power spectrum of Faraday depth structure.
Assuming depolarization by a turbulent Faraday screen for all sources, a
simulated flux-density-limited sample can reproduce the high RM scatter found
by Vanderwoude et al. (2024) for sources that are less than 3% polarized. RM
jitter of sources that are more than 3% polarized, is found to be smaller than
the observed scatter, indicating that plasma other than the near-source
environment dominates the RM scatter for the more polarized sources. The
significance of RM jitter for applications of the RM grid is discussed.

Abstract: We investigate the relativistic jet of the powerful radio-emitting blazar
J1429+5406 at redshift z=3.015. Our understanding of jet kinematics in z>3
quasars is still rather limited, based on a sample of less than about 50
objects. The blazar J1429+5406 was observed at a high angular resolution using
the method of very long baseline interferometry over more than two decades,
between 1994 and 2018. These observations were conducted at five radio
frequencies, covering a wide range from 1.7 to 15 GHz. The outer jet components
at ~20-40 milliarcsecond (mas) separations from the core do not show
discernible apparent motion. On the other hand, three jet components within the
central 10 mas region exhibit significant proper motion in the range of
(0.045-0.16)mas/year, including one that is among the fastest-moving jet
components at z>3 known to date. Based on the proper motion of the innermost
jet component and the measured brightness temperature of the core, we estimated
the Doppler factor, the bulk Lorentz factor, and the inclination angle of the
jet with respect to the line of sight. The core brightness temperature is at
least 3.6 x 10^{11} K, well exceeding the equipartition limit, indicating
Doppler-boosted radio emission. The low jet inclination (<5.4 deg) firmly
places J1429+5406 into the blazar category.

Background: Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus（GSE）是银河系最后一次重大合并事件，其遗留的碎片为研究银河系组装历史和矮星系的化学演化提供了重要线索。

Data: 使用了SAGA数据库中的数据。

Method: 通过分析中子俘获元素（如Eu和Ba）与Mg的丰度比（[Eu/Mg]、[Ba/Mg]和[Eu/Ba]），研究了GSE的恒星形成历史。

Result: 研究发现GSE经历了长达2 Gyr的缓慢恒星形成期，最终在与银河系合并时被终止，这些元素丰度比揭示了银河系及其卫星的复杂历史。

Abstract: The Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus was the last major merger and central turning
point in the Milky Way's story. This event, comparable in mass to the Large
Magellanic Cloud today, left behind significant debris that provides valuable
insights into the assembly history of our Galaxy and the chemical evolution of
dwarf galaxies. By examining the aftermath of the GSE merger, we can delve
deeper into understanding how the Milky Way's formation unfolded and how dwarf
galaxies evolved chemically. Specifically, the distinct patterns of neutron
capture elements such as Eu and Ba, along with Mg, offer clues about the star
formation history. Through a comprehensive analysis of data compiled in the
SAGA database, we investigated the Gaia Sausage-Enceladus' star formation
history. Elemental abundance ratios ([Eu/Mg], [Ba/Mg], and [Eu/Ba]) derived
from this study, when compared with those of surviving Milky Way satellites,
indicate that the GSE experienced a prolonged period of slow star formation,
lasting over 2 Gyr, until it was eventually quenched by merging with the Milky
Way. Consequently, these elemental signatures serve as a unique window into the
complex history of both surviving and accreted satellites orbiting our Galaxy.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Abstract: We analyze the velocity field of peripheral members of the Local Group. The
Hubble flow at distances from 400 to 1400~kpc, formed by 7 of 11 nearby
galaxies, is characterized by an extremely small line-of-sight velocity
dispersion of 15 km/s, which differs significantly from the predictions of
cosmological simulations of about 70 km/s. This fact allows us to determine the
total mass of the Local Group as $M_{LG} = (2.47 \pm 0.15) \times 10^{12}$
$M_\odot$ using an analytical model of the Hubble flow around a spherical
overdensity in the standard flat \LCDM{} universe. The practical equality of
this mass to the sum of the masses of our Galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy, as
well as the absence of mass growth in the range of distances under
consideration, gives grounds to conclude that the entire mass of the Local
Group is confined within the virial radii around its two main galaxies. The
barycenter, found from the minimal scatter of mass estimates, corresponds to
the mass ratio of the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy equal to
$M_{MW}/M_{M31} = 0.74\pm0.10$. The velocity of our Galaxy to the barycenter
turns out to be $62.6\pm2.6$ km/s. This allows us to determine the apex of the
Sun relative to the barycenter of the Local Group to be $(l,b,V) = (
+94.0^\circ \pm 0.7^\circ, -2.7^\circ \pm 0.3^\circ, 301 \pm 3$ km/s in the
Galactic coordinates.

Background: 大质量黑洞合并在其演化中的作用尚不明确，而双黑洞从形成到最终合并的动态演化过程存在大量物理不确定性。识别近距离大质量双黑洞（MBBHs）对理解其在超大质量黑洞形成和演化中的重要性至关重要。

Abstract: The role of mergers in the evolution of massive black holes is still unclear,
and their dynamical evolution, from the formation of pairs to binaries and the
final coalescence, carries large physical uncertainties. The identification of
the elusive population of close massive binary black holes (MBBHs) is crucial
to understand the importance of mergers in the formation and evolution of
supermassive black holes. It has been proposed that MBBHs may display periodic
optical/ultra-violet variability. Optical surveys provide photometric
measurements of a large variety of objects, over decades and searching for
periodicities coming from galaxies in their long-term optical/UV lightcurves
may help identify new MBBH candidates. Using the Catalina Real-Time Transient
Survey (CRTS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, we studied the
long-term periodicity of variable sources in the centre of galaxies identified
using the galaxy catalogue Glade+. We report 36 MBBHs candidates, with
sinusoidal variability with amplitudes between 0.1 and 0.8 magnitudes over 3-5
cycles, through fitting 15 years of data. The periodicities are also detected
when adding a red noise contribution to the sine model. Moreover, the
periodicities are corroborated through Generalized Lomb Scargle (GLS)
periodograms analysis, providing supplementary evidence for the observed
modulation. We also indicate 58 objects, that were previously proposed to be
MBBH candidates from analysis of CRTS data only. Adding ZTF data clearly shows
that the previously claimed modulation is due to red noise. We also created a
catalogue of 221 weaker candidates which require further observations over the
coming years to help validate their nature. Based on our 36 MBBHs candidates,
we expect ~20 MBBHs at z<1, which is commensurate with simulations. Further
observations will help confirm these results.

Method: 构建可解释的神经网络框架，分析星系周围环境对其属性的影响。

Abstract: Galaxies reside within dark matter halos, but their properties are influenced
not only by their halo properties but also by the surrounding environment. We
construct an interpretable neural network framework to characterize the
surrounding environment of galaxies and investigate the extent to which their
properties are affected by neighboring galaxies in IllustrisTNG300 data
($z=0$). Our models predict galaxy properties (stellar mass and star formation
rate) given dark matter subhalo properties of both host subhalo and of
surrounding galaxies, which serve as an explainable, flexible galaxy-halo
connection model. We find that prediction accuracy peaks when incorporating
only the nearest neighboring galaxy for stellar mass prediction, while star
formation rate prediction benefits from information from up to the
third-nearest neighbor. We determine that environmental influence follows a
clear hierarchical pattern, with the nearest neighbor providing the dominant
contribution that diminishes rapidly with additional neighbors. We confirm that
central and satellite galaxies, as well as different galaxy categories based on
mass and star-forming activity, exhibit distinct environmental dependencies.
Environmental dependence for low-mass galaxies ($\log(M_*/M_\odot) < 10$) shows
35-50% environmental contribution compared to just 8-30% for massive centrals,
while satellite galaxies experience consistently stronger environmental effects
than centrals across all populations. Furthermore, we find that the most
significant attribute from neighboring subhalos for predicting target galaxy
properties is its distance to the nearest neighboring galaxy. These
quantitative results offer guidance for constructing more sophisticated
empirical and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation that explicitly include
environmental dependence as a function of galaxy type and mass.

**TL;DR**: 研究发现恒星形成主序（SFMS）的弥散源于宇宙吸积流的波动，并由恒星表面密度调控。

Background: 恒星形成主序（SFMS）是理解星系演化的关键框架，但其0.3-0.4 dex的弥散起源仍是一个未解决的重要问题。

Data: 使用了约50万个星系的大样本数据。

Method: 分析了星系的关键结构参数（有效半径、恒星表面密度和形态）在SFMS上的分布对称性。

Result: 研究发现SFMS上高和低恒星形成率（SFR）的星系具有相似的基本参数，且较小的有效半径或较高的恒星表面密度会导致更大的SFR弥散，这种弥散反映了对宇宙吸积流波动的响应。

Abstract: The Star-Forming Main Sequence (SFMS) serves as a critical framework for
understanding galaxy evolution, highlighting the relationship between star
formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses M_* across cosmic time. Despite its
significance, the origin of the 0.3-0.4 dex dispersion in the SFMS remains a
key unresolved question. Uncovering the origin of dispersion is crucial for
understanding the evolution of galaxies. Using a large sample of approximately
500,000 galaxies, we reveal an unprecedented symmetry in the distribution of
key structural properties-effective radius (R_{\rm e}), stellar surface density
(M_*/R_{\rm e}^2), and morphology on the SFMS. This symmetry implies that
galaxies with high (above SFMS) and low (below SFMS) SFRs share similar
fundamental parameters. Moreover, galaxies with smaller R_{\rm e} or higher
M_*/R_{\rm e}^2 exhibit greater dispersion in SFR. This dispersion reflects the
response to fluctuations in cosmic accretion flows, while the SFR itself
represents the time-averaged effect over the gas consumption timescale. Shorter
gas consumption timescales, associated with higher M_*/R_{\rm e}^2, lead to
greater SFR dispersion. Our results reveal that the variation of SFR originates
from the oscillation of accretion flow and is regulated by the stellar surface
density.

Background: 基本金属丰度关系（FMR）是星系恒星质量、恒星形成率和气体金属丰度之间的三向关系，是外银河系研究中最重要的关系之一。金属丰度与引力势密切相关，但模拟与观测样本的差异使得这一关系在真实星系中的适用性尚不明确。

Abstract: The fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) - the three-way trend between
galaxy stellar masses, star-formation rates (SFRs) and gaseous metallicities -
remains amongst the most studied extragalactic relations. Furthermore,
metallicity correlates particularly tightly with gravitational potential.
Simulations support a shared origin for these relations relating to long-term
gas inflow history variations; however, differences between simulated and
observed galaxy samples make it unclear whether this holds for real galaxies.
We use MaNGA integral field observations to probe these relations in
star-forming galaxies at one effective radius. We confirm the FMR and
equivalent relations for stellar metallicity (FMR*) and gaseous N/O
(fundamental nitrogen relation, FNR). We find that all relations persist when
considering gravitational potential in place of stellar mass and/or considering
stellar ages in place of SFR, with the gaseous relations strengthened
significantly by considering potential. The gaseous FMR disappears at high
masses/potentials, while the FNR persists and the FMR* strengthens. Our results
suggest a unified interpretation of galaxies' gaseous and stellar metallicities
and their N/O abundances in terms of their formation histories. Deeper
gravitational potentials correspond to earlier star-formation histories (SFHs)
and faster gas consumption, producing tight potential-abundance relations for
stars and gas. In weak potentials, galaxy SFR variations primarily result from
recent gas inflows, mostly affecting gas abundances. In deeper potentials, SFR
variations instead correspond to broad differences in SFH shapes resulting from
differences in long-term gas consumption histories, which is most visible in
stellar abundances. This unified interpretation could be confirmed with
upcoming higher redshift spectroscopic surveys.

Abstract: Understanding cosmic ray (CR) diffusion in a partially ionized medium is both
crucial and challenging. In this study, we investigate CR superdiffusion in
turbulent, partially ionized media using high-resolution 3D two-fluid
simulations that treat ions and neutrals separately. We examine the influence
of neutral-ion decoupling and the associated damping of turbulence on CR
propagation in both transonic and supersonic conditions. Our simulations
demonstrate that neutral-ion decoupling significantly damps velocity, density,
and magnetic field fluctuations at small scales, producing spectral slopes
steeper than those of Kolmogorov and Burgers scaling. We also identify an
intermediate coupling regime in which neutrals remain partially coupled with
ions, leading to a steepening of kinetic energy spectra in both fluids. Shocks
can enhance the neutral-ion coupling, thereby reducing the differences between
neutral and ion density structures. Moreover, the damping of magnetic field
fluctuations substantially decreases pitch angle scattering, which increases CR
parallel mean free paths. As a result, CR perpendicular transport transitions
between two distinct superdiffusive regimes: a scattering-dominated regime with
perpendicular displacement proportional to $t^{3/4}$, and a scattering-free
regime dominated by magnetic field line wandering, with perpendicular
displacement scaling as $t^{3/2}$. When the pitch angle is large, the effects
of magnetic mirroring, naturally arising in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence,
become significant, enhancing the confinement (but not fully trapping) of CRs
and inducing oscillations in their perpendicular displacement. These results
highlight the necessity of incorporating two-fluid effects for accurately
modeling CR transport in partially ionized environments such as molecular
clouds and dense interstellar clumps.

Abstract: 3D Galactic magnetic fields are critical for understanding the interstellar
medium, Galactic foreground polarization, and the propagation of
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. Leveraging recent theoretical insights into
anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, we introduce a deep learning
framework to predict the full 3D magnetic field structure-including the
plane-of-sky (POS) position angle, line-of-sight (LOS) inclination, magnetic
field strength, sonic Mach number ($M_s$), and Alfv\'en Mach number
($M_A$)-from spectroscopic H~I observations. The deep learning model is trained
on synthetic H~I emission data generated from multiphase 3D MHD simulations. We
then apply the trained model to observational data from the Commensal Radio
Astronomy FAST Survey, presenting maps of 3D magnetic field orientation,
magnetic field strength, $M_s$, and $M_A$ for two H~I clouds, a low-velocity
cloud (LVC) and an intermediate-velocity cloud (IVC), which overlap in the POS
yet reside at different LOS distances. The deep-learning-predicted POS magnetic
field position angles align closely with those determined using the velocity
gradient technique, whose integrated results are consistent with independent
measurements from Planck 353~GHz polarization data. This study demonstrates the
potential of deep learning approaches as powerful tools for modeling the 3D
distributions of 3D Galactic magnetic fields and turbulence properties
throughout the Galaxy.

Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) consists of a multiphase gas, including the
warm neutral medium (WNM), the unstable neutral medium (UNM), and the cold
neutral medium (CNM). While significant attention has been devoted to
understanding the WNM and CNM, the formation of a substantial fraction of the
UNM, with temperatures ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand Kelvin,
remains less well understood. In this study, we present three-dimensional
hydrodynamical and magnetohydrodynamical simulations of turbulent multiphase
ISM to investigate the roles of turbulence and magnetic fields in regulating
the multiphase ISM. Our results confirm that turbulence is crucial in
redistributing energy and producing the UNM. The turbulent mixing effect
smooths the phase diagram, flattens the pressure-density relationship, and
increases the fraction of gas in the UNM. We find that magnetic fields not only
contribute to sustaining the UNM but also influence the dynamics and
distribution of gas across all phases. Magnetic fields introduce anisotropy to
the turbulent cascade, reducing the efficiency of turbulent mixing in the
direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. We find the anisotropy results
in a less flat phase diagram compared to hydrodynamical cases. Furthermore, the
inclusion of magnetic fields shallowens the second-order velocity structure
functions across multiple ISM phases, suggesting that more small-scale
fluctuations are driven. These fluctuations contribute to the formation of the
UNM by altering the energy cascade and thermodynamic properties of the gas. Our
findings suggest that the combined effects of turbulence and magnetic fields
are important in regulating the multiphase ISM.

Abstract: Bosonic stars,hypothetical astrophysical entities, are generally categorized
into two primary classes based on the nature of their constituent particles:
Einstein Klein Gordon stars, made up of massive scalar bosons, and Proca stars,
their vector ''cousins''. Depending on the boson masses and field frequencies,
these objects may exhibit properties of diffuse, massive structures, with sizes
comparable to or even exceeding those of galaxies. This concept has inspired
the bosonic dark matter halo hypothesis, providing a theoretical framework to
effectively model the dark matter content of galactic halos. In this paper we
build on our previous work to explore the possibility of using vector and
scalar bosons to model the components of galactic dark matter halos and
subhalos in order to reproduce the observed rotation curves of galaxies. By
employing diverse combinations of those bosonic dark matter models in
conjunction with observable data for a sample of galaxies, we show that our two
component dark matter approach notably improves the agreement between
observations and theoretical predictions with respect to our previous
investigation. Our framework may shed new light on the enduring mystery
surrounding the apparent matter deficit observed in dwarf and spiral galaxies.

Abstract: Context. We present simulations of a massive young star cluster using
\textsc{Nbody6++GPU} and \textsc{MOCCA}. The cluster is initially more compact
than previously published models, with one million stars, a total mass of $5.86
\times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, and a half-mass radius of $0.1~\mathrm{pc}$.
  Aims. We analyse the formation and growth of a very massive star (VMS)
through successive stellar collisions and investigate the subsequent formation
of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a dense star cluster.
  Methods. We use both direct \textit{N}-body and Monte Carlo simulations,
incorporating updated stellar evolution prescriptions (SSE/BSE) tailored to
massive stars and VMSs. These include revised treatments of stellar radii,
rejuvenation, and mass loss during collisions. While the prescriptions
represent reasonable extrapolations into the VMS regime, the internal structure
and thermal state of VMSs formed through stellar collisions remain uncertain,
and future work may require further refinement.
  Results. We find that runaway stellar collisions in the cluster core produce
a VMS exceeding $5 \times 10^4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ within 5 Myr, which
subsequently collapses into an IMBH.
  Conclusions. Our model suggests that dense stellar environments may enable
the formation of very massive stars and massive black hole seeds through
runaway stellar collisions. These results provide a potential pathway for early
black hole growth in star clusters and offer theoretical context for
interpreting recent JWST observations of young, compact clusters at high
redshift.

Abstract: Cosmological theories suggest that the angular momentum of galaxies should be
closely linked to the structure of the cosmic web. The Local Supercluster is
the closest and most studied structure where the orientation of galaxy spins
can be studied. As noted by Navarro et al. (2004), the use of edge-on galaxies
greatly simplifies this task by reducing it to an analysis of the distribution
of position angles in the Supergalactic coordinates. We reexamine this
correlation using modern catalogs that allow us to perform a more robust
statistical analysis. We test the dependence on redshift, spatial position,
luminosity, and color. We find that the spins of galaxies with stellar mass
$M_*<10^{8.7}$ $M_\odot$ show a weak tendency to be aligned perpendicular to
the plane of the Local Supercluster at the 2-sigma level. Other subsamples do
not show statistically significant correlations.

Abstract: Dwarf AGN serve as the ideal systems for identifying intermediate mass black
holes (IMBHs) down to the most elusive regimes ($\sim 10^3 - 10^4 M_{\odot}$).
However, the ubiquitously metal-poor nature of dwarf galaxies gives rise to
ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) that can mimic the spectral signatures of
IMBH excitation. We present a novel photoionization model suite that
simultaneously incorporates IMBHs and ULXs in a metal-poor, highly star-forming
environment. We account for changes in $M_{BH}$ according to formation seeding
channels and metallicity, and changes in ULX populations with post-starburst
age and metallicity. We find that broadband X-rays and UV emission lines are
insensitive to $M_{BH}$ and largely unable to distinguish between ULXs and
IMBHs. Many optical diagnostic diagrams cannot correctly identify dwarf AGN.
The notable exceptions include He~II~$\lambda$4686 and [O~I]~$\lambda$6300, for
which we redefine typical demarcations to account for ULX contributions.
Emission lines in the mid-IR show the most promise in separating stellar, ULX,
IMBH, and shock excitation while presenting sensitivity to $M_{BH}$ and
$f_{\text{AGN}}$. Overall, our results expose the potential biases in
identifying and characterizing dwarf AGN purely on strong line ratios and
diagnostic diagrams rather than holistically evaluating the entire spectrum. As
a proof of concept, we argue that recently discovered over-massive BHs in
high-$z$ JWST AGN might not represent the overall BH population, with many
galaxies in these samples potentially being falsely classified as purely
star-forming.

Abstract: Stars form from molecular gas under complex conditions influenced by multiple
competing physical mechanisms, such as gravity, turbulence, and magnetic
fields. However, accurately identifying the fraction of gas actively involved
in star formation remains challenging. Using dust continuum observations from
the Herschel Space Observatory, we derived column density maps and their
associated probability distribution functions (N-PDFs). Assuming the power-law
component in the N-PDFs corresponds to gravitationally bound (and thus
star-forming) gas, we analyzed a diverse sample of molecular clouds spanning a
wide range of mass and turbulence conditions. This sample included 21 molecular
clouds from the solar neighborhood ($d<$500 pc) and 16 high-mass star-forming
molecular clouds. For these two groups, we employed the counts of young stellar
objects (YSOs) and mid-/far-infrared luminosities as proxies for star formation
rates (SFR), respectively. Both groups revealed a tight linear correlation
between the mass of gravitationally bound gas and the SFR, suggesting a
universally constant star formation efficiency in the gravitationally bound gas
phase. The star-forming gas mass derived from threshold column densities
($N_{{\mbox {threshold}}}$) varies from cloud to cloud and is widely
distributed over the range of $\sim$1--17$\times$10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ based on
N-PDF analysis. But in solar neighborhood clouds, it is in rough consistency
with the traditional approach using $A_{\rm V}$ $\ge$ 8 mag. In contrast, in
high turbulent regions (e.g., the Central Molecular Zone) where the classical
approach fails, the gravitationally bound gas mass and SFR still follow the
same correlation as other high-mass star-forming regions in the Milky Way. Our
findings also strongly support the interpretation that gas in the power-law
component of the N-PDF is undergoing self-gravitational collapse to form stars.

Abstract: One of the most profound empirical laws of star formation is the Gao-Solomon
relation, a linear correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and the
dense molecular gas mass. It is puzzling how the complicated physics in
star-formation results in this surprisingly simple proportionality. Using
archival Herschel and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
Observations, we derived the masses of the most massive cores ($M^{\rm
max}_{\rm core}$) and masses of the gravitationally bound gas ($ M_{\rm
gas}^{\rm bound}$) in the parent molecular clouds for a sample of low-mass and
high-mass star-forming regions. We discovered a significant correlation
$\log(M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}/M_{\odot}) = 0.506 \log(M_{\rm gas}^{\rm
bound}/M_{\odot})-0.32$. Our discovered $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$-$M_{\rm
gas}^{\rm bound}$ correlation can be approximately converted to the Gao-Solomon
relation if there is (1) a constant 30% efficiency of converting $M^{\rm
max}_{\rm core}$ to the mass of the most massive star ($m^{\rm max}_{\rm
star}$), and (2) if SFR and $m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$ are tightly related
through $\log({\rm SFR}/(M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1})) = 2.04 \log(m^{\rm max}_{\rm
star}/M_{\odot})-5.80$. Intriguingly, both requirements have been suggested by
previous theoretical studies (c.f. Yan et al. 2017). Based on this result, we
hypothesize that the Gao-Solomon relation is a consequence of combining the
following three non-trivial relations (i) SFR vs. $m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$,
(ii) $m^{\rm max}_{\rm star}$ vs. $M^{\rm max}_{\rm core}$, and (iii) $M^{\rm
max}_{\rm core}$ vs. $M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$. This finding may open a new
possibility to understand the Gao-Solomon relation in an analytic sense.

### [25] [Systematic Investigation into Radio Supernovae with Markov Chain Monte Carlo Analysis: Implications for Massive Stars' Mass Loss and Shock Acceleration Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06609)
*Tomoki Matsuoka,Keiichi Maeda,Shigeo S. Kimura,Masaomi Tanaka*

**TL;DR**: 通过分析32个射电超新星样本，研究发现剥离包层超新星前身星的质量损失率比II型超新星高一个数量级，并提出了标准射电超新星模型的局限性可能与前身星附近存在密集的CSM有关。

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 射电超新星的研究旨在了解前身星的质量损失率和激波加速效率的统计趋势，现有研究对标准模型的局限性提出了疑问。

Data: 使用了32个射电超新星样本，其中27个样本的光变曲线峰值清晰。

Method: 采用马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛（MCMC）分析方法，结合广泛使用的射电超新星模型进行参数估计。

Result: 研究发现剥离包层超新星前身星的质量损失率（约10的负3次方太阳质量每年）比II型超新星（小于10的负4次方太阳质量每年）高一个数量级；电子加速和磁场放大效率小于10的负2次方，且能量均分的可能性未被排除；标准模型的局限性可能与前身星附近存在密集的CSM有关。

Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of radio supernovae (SNe) to investigate the
statistical tendencies of SN progenitors' mass-loss rates and shock
acceleration efficiencies. We conduct parameter estimation through Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for 32 radio SN samples with a clear peak observed
in their light curves, and successfully fit 27 objects with the widely-used
radio SN model. We find the inferred mass-loss rates of stripped-envelope SN
progenitors are by an order of magnitude greater ($\sim 10^{-3}\,M_\odot{\rm
yr}^{-1}$) than those of SN II progenitors ($<10^{-4}\,M_\odot{\rm yr}^{-1}$).
The efficiencies of electron acceleration and magnetic field amplification are
found to be less than $10^{-2}$, and the possibility of their energy
equipartition is not ruled out. On the other hand, we find the following two
properties that might be related to limitations of the standard model for radio
SNe; one is the extremely high magnetic field amplification efficiency, and the
other is the shallower density gradient of the outer ejecta. We suggest the new
interpretation that these peculiar results are misleading due to the setup that
is not included in our model, and we identify the missing setup as a dense CSM
in the vicinity of the progenitor. This means that a large fraction of radio SN
progenitors might possess dense CSM in the vicinity of the progenitor, which is
not smoothly connected with the outer CSM.

**TL;DR**: 研究发现詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜观测到的‘小红点’（LRDs）可能是由超大质量黑洞驱动的活动星系核，其极端吸积过程被一个巨大的光学厚包层所限制，从而解释了其独特的V形光谱和年尺度变异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜最近观测到一类致密的红色天体（红移z约4-7），称为‘小红点’（LRDs）。这些天体具有宽巴尔末发射线，表明其由超大质量黑洞驱动的活动星系核，但其X射线和射电辐射异常微弱且变异性低，暗示存在超爱丁顿吸积过程。

Data: 使用詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜的观测数据，研究对象为红移z约4-7的‘小红点’（LRDs）。

Method: 提出理论模型，认为超大质量黑洞被一个巨大的光学厚包层包围，该包层通过吸积过程维持，并限制极端吸积驱动的外流。

Result: 模型解释了LRDs的红色光学连续谱和V形光谱特征，以及年尺度变异性，表明包层不仅调节反馈过程，还为早期宇宙中黑洞的快速生长提供了气体储备。

Abstract: Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have uncovered a
population of compact, red object ($z\sim 4\text{--}7$) known as little red
dots (LRDs). The presence of broad Balmer emission lines indicates active
galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes (BHs), while LRDs exhibit
unusually weak X-ray and radio emission and low variability, suggesting
super-Eddington accretion that obscures the central engine. We suggest that
such an extreme accretion disc inevitably drives strong outflows, which would
disrupt the LRDs themselves unless confined within the nuclear region -- posing
a general feedback problem for overmassive BHs. To resolve this, we propose
that the BH is embedded in a massive, optically thick envelope that
gravitationally confines the outflow, making any outflow a no-go. This
envelope, powered by accretion on to the BH, radiates at nearly the Eddington
limit, and is sustained by an infall of the interstellar medium at a rate on
the order of $\sim 1 M_{\odot}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. A photosphere emerges either
within the envelope or in the infalling medium, with a characteristic
temperature of $5000$ - $7000 {\rm K}$, near the Hayashi limit. The resulting
blackbody emission naturally explains the red optical continuum of the distinct
V-shaped spectrum observed in most LRDs. Furthermore, the dynamical time-scale
at the photosphere, $\sim 0.01~{\rm pc}$, is consistent with the observed
year-scale variabilities. The nuclear structure and spectral features of LRDs
are shaped by this envelope, which not only regulates feedback but also acts as
a gas reservoir that sustains rapid BH growth in the early universe.

Background: NVSS J171822+423948被认为是IceCube中微子事件IC-201221A的对应体，但其性质尚不明确。

Data: 使用了VLBA在4至7 GHz的双波段观测数据，以及文献中的存档射电数据。

Method: 采用了甚长基线干涉测量（VLBI）技术，结合双波段观测和频谱分析。

Result: 发现该源具有高度可变、多普勒增强的射电辐射，紧凑结构从kpc到pc尺度，频谱略反转，最大喷流倾角不超过5度，确认为耀变体。

Abstract: The radio quasar NVSS~J171822+423948 (J1718+4239) was proposed as the
counterpart of the IceCube neutrino event IC-201221A. To reveal the nature of
the source, we conducted new very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)
observations of this blazar candidate with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA).
The observations were carried out in dual-band mode between $4$ and $7$~GHz.
Archival radio data from the literature were also collected for comparison. Our
analysis revealed highly variable, Doppler-boosted radio emission of the
source, with compact structure at both kpc and pc scales, a slightly inverted
spectrum, and a maximum jet inclination angle of $\theta\le5\degr$. These
results confirm J1718+4239 as a blazar-type object.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 从近地太阳风到星系团内介质，高β、无碰撞磁化等离子体在宇宙中普遍存在。这些系统中的能量和动量传输机制尚不完全清楚，且现有的航天器任务和数值模拟难以全面研究这些多尺度、多维过程。

Method: 提出了建造新一代实验室设施以创建高β、无碰撞磁化等离子体的方法，并讨论了目标参数、诊断要求和设备几何结构的开发。

Result: 工作组已开始定义技术需求，并推动了社区内的新协同效应，预计未来设施将被广泛用于研究。

Abstract: From the near-Earth solar wind to the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters,
collisionless, high-beta, magnetized plasmas pervade our universe. Energy and
momentum transport from large-scale fields and flows to small scale motions of
plasma particles is ubiquitous in these systems, but a full picture of the
underlying physical mechanisms remains elusive. The transfer is often mediated
by a turbulent cascade of Alfv{\'e}nic fluctuations as well as a variety of
kinetic instabilities; these processes tend to be multi-scale and/or
multi-dimensional, which makes them difficult to study using spacecraft
missions and numerical simulations alone (Dorfman et al. 2023; Lichko et al.
2020, 2023). Meanwhile, existing laboratory devices struggle to produce the
collisionless, high ion beta ($\beta_i \gtrsim 1$), magnetized plasmas across
the range of scales necessary to address these problems. As envisioned in
recent community planning documents (Carter et al. 2020; Milchberg and Scime
2020; Baalrud et al. 2020; Dorfman et al. 2023; National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine 2024, it is therefore important to build a next
generation laboratory facility to create a $\beta_i \gtrsim 1$, collisionless,
magnetized plasma in the laboratory for the first time. A Working Group has
been formed and is actively defining the necessary technical requirements to
move the facility towards a construction-ready state. Recent progress includes
the development of target parameters and diagnostic requirements as well as the
identification of a need for source-target device geometry. As the working
group is already leading to new synergies across the community, we anticipate a
broad community of users funded by a variety of federal agencies (including
NASA, DOE, and NSF) to make copious use of the future facility.

**TL;DR**: 研究发现银河系薄盘中的恒星LAMOST J020623.21+494127.9是一颗高度r过程增强的r-II星，其重中子俘获元素主要由主r过程产生，但现有模型无法完全拟合观测数据。

Background: 银河系薄盘中的恒星LAMOST J020623.21+494127.9被报告为高度r过程增强的r-II星，其化学组成反映了其诞生时气体云的固有成分。

Data: 研究使用了该恒星的丰度数据集，包括10种重中子俘获元素在内的25种元素。

Method: 采用丰度分解方法对25种元素进行拟合，并通过丰度比和组分比探索其天体物理起源。

Result: 研究发现大质量恒星对轻元素的产生有显著贡献，重中子俘获元素主要由主r过程产生，但现有主r过程模型无法完全拟合观测数据，表明可能存在另一种主r过程模式。

Abstract: Object LAMOST J020623.21+494127.9 (program star) in the thin disk of the
Milky Way (MW) is reported as a highly r-process-enhanced (RPE) r-II star
with[Eu/Fe]= +1.32 and [Fe/H]= -0.54. The chemical profile of the star reflects
the intrinsic composition of the gas cloud present at its birth. Using an
abundance decomposition method, we fit 25 elements from the abundance dataset,
including 10 heavy neutron capture elements. We explore the astrophysical
origin of the elements in this star through its abundance ratios and component
ratios. We find that the contributions from the massive stars played a
significant role in the production of light elements in the program star. Our
analysis reveals that the heavy neutron-capture elements are produced purely by
the main r-process. However, the adopted main r-process model does not
adequately fit the observed data, suggesting another main r-process pattern may
exist.

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过磁流体动力学模拟和相对论电子输运模型，分析了高速大质量恒星弓激波的同步辐射发射，并生成了1.40和4.86 GHz的合成射电和偏振图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 高速恒星（V > 30 km/s）与星际介质相互作用时，其强大的星风会在适当条件下产生激波系统，尤其是弓激波，扰动周围介质并产生红外辐射。最近发现的两个恒星弓激波星云的非热射电发射表明这些源可能将电子加速到相对论能量。

Data: 研究使用了1.40和4.86 GHz两个频率的射电和偏振数据。

Method: 采用磁流体动力学模拟和扩散近似下的相对论电子输运模型，模拟了稳态状态下的等离子体相互作用，并考虑了主要的去极化效应。

Result: 研究发现：i) 在最低频率下，源内的法拉第旋转效应显著；ii) 仅通过偏振测量推断局部磁场方向可能误导；iii) 弓激波结构及其周围电离等离子体产生的热射电发射可能超过偏振发射；iv) 背景电子的贡献较小。

Abstract: High velocity stars move through the interstellar medium with V > 30 km/s.
When the star has powerful winds, under the appropriate conditions, the
interaction of the wind with the interstellar material produces a system of
shocks. The outer shock, called the bowshock, perturbs the ambient medium,
heating and compressing the gas. The dust in the compressed bowshock cools,
producing infrared radiation. This emission appears as extended coma-shape
structures. The discovery of radio nonthermal emission from two stellar
bowshock nebulae indicates that these sources might be accelerating electrons
up to relativistic energies. The produced nonthermal radio emission is most
probably synchrotron which has a high degree of polarization. In this work we
model the synchrotron emission of runaway massive star bowshocks aiming to
produce synthetic radio emission and polarization maps for two frequencies:
1.40 and 4.86 GHz. We model the interacting plasmas in a steady-state regime by
means of magnetohydrodynamics simulations and we compute the injection and
transport of the relativistic electrons in the diffusion approximation. We
include in the model the most important depolarization effects. Our main
conclusions are i) the effects of Faraday rotation within the source are
important at the lowest frequency considered, ii) inferring the local magnetic
field direction from polarization measurements only can be misleading, iii)
thermal radio emission produced by ionized plasma within the bowshock structure
and surroundings can surpass the polarized one for the considered frequencies,
and iv) the contribution from the background electrons is minor.

Background: M矮星作为银河系中最常见的恒星类型，其丰度研究有助于理解行星形成过程和银河系的化学演化，尤其是α捕获元素的作用。

Data: 使用了GIANO-B光谱仪获取的M矮星光谱数据，以及干涉测量数据。

Method: 采用Turbospectrum和TSFitPy工具结合MARCS大气模型，通过拟合合成光谱与观测光谱进行差分丰度分析，并以太阳光谱作为参考。

Result: 研究得到的铁、钛和钙丰度与文献中的其他结果在误差范围内基本一致，但可供比较的研究较少。

Abstract: Abundances of M dwarfs, being the most numerous stellar type in the Galaxy,
can enhance our understanding of planet formation processes. They can also be
used to study the chemical evolution of the Galaxy, where in particular
alpha-capture elements play an important role. We aim to obtain abundances for
Fe, Ti, and Ca for a small sample of well-known M dwarfs for which
interferometric measurements are available. These stars and their abundances
are intended to serve as a benchmark for future large-scale spectroscopic
studies. We analysed spectra obtained with the GIANO-B spectrograph.
Turbospectrum and the wrapper TSFitPy were used with MARCS atmospheric models
in order to fit synthetic spectra to the observed spectra. We performed a
differential abundance analysis in which we also analysed a solar spectrum with
the same method and then subtracted the derived abundances line-by-line. The
median was taken as the final abundance for each element and each star. Our
abundances of Fe, Ti, and Ca agree mostly within uncertainties when comparing
with other values from the literature. However, there are few studies to
compare with.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Abstract: We report the discovery of an actinide-boost, very metal-poor
($\left[\mathrm{Fe/H} \right]=-2.38$), $r$-process-enhanced
($\left[\mathrm{Eu/Fe} \right]=0.80$) star, LAMOST J0804+5740, within the
Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). Based on the high-resolution ($R\sim36,000\; and
\;60,000$) and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with the High
Dispersion Spectrograph on the Subaru Telescope, the abundances of 48 species
are determined. Its $\log\epsilon\rm(\mathrm{Th}/\mathrm{Eu}) = -0.22 $
establishes it as the first confirmed actinide-boost star within the GSE.
Comparative analysis of its abundance pattern with theoretical $r$-process
models reveals that the magnetorotationally driven jet supernova $r$-process
model with $\hat{L}v$ = 0.2 provides the best fit and successfully reproduces
the actinide-boost signature. Kinematic analysis of actinide-boost stars
reveals that approximately two-thirds of them are classified as
$\textit{ex-situ}$ stars, suggesting that actinide-boost stars are more likely
to originate from accreted dwarf galaxies. As the first actinide-boost star
identified within the GSE, J0804+5740 will provide valuable insights into
$r$-process nucleosynthesis in accreted dwarf galaxies like the GSE, especially
on the production of the heaviest elements.
