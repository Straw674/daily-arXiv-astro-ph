### [1] [Ages and metallicities of quiescent galaxies: confronting broadband ($UVJ$) colours with stellar absorption lines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08858)

**TL;DR**: 通过LEGA-C数据对约700个静止星系进行年龄和金属丰度测量，发现其在UVJ图中的行为与恒星种群合成模型预测不符，揭示了依赖连续谱形状模型拟合可能导致系统性偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 长期以来，研究红移超过1的静止星系一直依赖于易受年龄、金属丰度、尘埃和恒星形成历史等因素混淆的光谱能量分布（SEDs），直到最近通过深场静止光学光谱才实现了对金属丰度和年龄的可靠测量。

Data: 使用了来自LEGA-C（Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census）的约700个质量在10.2≲log(M*/M⊙)≲11.8之间的静止星系的光谱数据。

Method: 通过连续谱归一化的吸收线光谱测量年龄和金属丰度，并与独立的静止U-V和V-J颜色进行比较。

Result: 研究发现年龄和金属丰度在UVJ图中的行为与恒星种群合成模型预测不符，金属丰度趋势与模型预期相反，且动力学质量-光比趋势也与模型预测显著不同，表明依赖连续谱形状模型拟合可能导致系统性偏差。

Abstract: For decades, studying quiescent galaxies beyond $z\sim1$ has been challenging
due to the reliance on photometric spectral energy distributions (SEDs), which
are highly susceptible to degeneracies between age, metallicity, dust, and
star-formation history (SFH). Only recently has deep, rest-frame, optical
spectroscopy made robust metallicity and age measurements possible, allowing us
to empirically assess their effects on continuum shapes. To this end, we
measure ages and metallicities of $\sim700$ massive
($10.2\lesssim\log(M_*/M_\odot)\lesssim11.8$), quiescent galaxies at
$0.6\lesssim z\lesssim1.0$ from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census
(LEGA-C) via continuum-normalized, absorption-line spectra, and compare with
independent rest-frame $U-V$ and $V-J$ colours. Age increases along the
quiescent sequence as both colours redden, consistent with stellar population
synthesis (SPS) model predictions. Metallicity increases perpendicularly to the
age trend, with higher metallicities at redder $U-V$ and bluer $V-J$ colours.
Thus, age and metallicity behave differently in the $UVJ$ diagram. Moreover,
this trend conflicts with SPS model expectations of increasing metallicity
approximately along the quiescent sequence. Independent dynamical mass-to-light
ratio trends also differ dramatically from SPS model predictions. These results
demonstrate that relying on model fits to continuum shapes alone may lead to
systematic biases in ages, metallicities, and stellar masses. The cause of
these data-model disparities may stem from non-solar abundance patterns in
quiescent galaxies or the treatment of evolved stellar phases in the models.
Resolving these discrepancies is crucial, as photometric data remain central
even with \textit{JWST}.

### [2] [Marvelous Metals: Surveying the Circumgalactic Medium of Simulated Dwarf Galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08861)
*Daniel R. Piacitelli,Alyson M. Brooks,Charlotte Christensen,N. Nicole Sanchez,Yakov Faerman,Sijing Shen,Akaxia Cruz,Ben Keller,Thomas R. Quinn,James Wadsley*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过Marvel-ous Dwarfs和Marvelous Massive Dwarfs流体动力学模拟，分析了64个孤立矮星系的环星系介质（CGM），发现CGM是矮星系质量和金属的重要储存库，尤其是暖气体相。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 矮星系对能量反馈过程特别敏感，已知会从其盘中损失大量质量和金属。目前对矮星系的环星系介质（CGM）的研究仍存在不足，尤其是在质量和金属保留率方面。

Data: 使用了64个孤立矮星系（6.0<log(M*/M⊙)<9.5）在z=0时的数据，来源于Marvel-ous Dwarfs和Marvelous Massive Dwarfs流体动力学模拟。

Method: 采用了流体动力学模拟方法，分析了CGM的柱密度、质量和金属保留率及其物理性质。

Result: 研究发现，48±11%的R200c内的重子物质存在于CGM中，其中约70%的CGM质量处于暖气体相（10^4.5<T<10^5.5 K），暖气体和冷气体相各保留了5-10%的金属。此外，星系质量与CGM金属保留率之间的相关性较弱。

Abstract: Dwarf galaxies are uniquely sensitive to energetic feedback processes and are
known to experience substantial mass and metal loss from their disk. Here, we
investigate the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of 64 isolated dwarf galaxies
($6.0<$log(M$_*/M_{\odot}$)$<9.5$) at $z=0$ from the Marvel-ous Dwarfs and
Marvelous Massive Dwarfs hydrodynamic simulations. Our galaxies produce column
densities broadly consistent with current observations. We investigate these
column densities in the context of mass and metal retention rates and the
physical properties of the CGM. We find $48\pm11\%$ of all baryons within
$R_{200c}$ reside in the CGM, with $\sim70\%$ of CGM mass existing in a warm
gas phase, $10^{4.5}<T<10^{5.5}$ K that dominates beyond $r/R_{200c}\sim0.5$.
Further, the warm and cool ($10^{4.0}<T<10^{4.5}$ K) gas phases each retain
$5-10\%$ of metals formed by the dwarf galaxy. The significant fraction of mass
and metals residing in the warm CGM phase provides an interpretation for the
lack of observed low ion detections beyond $b/R_{200c}\sim0.5$ at $z\sim0$. We
find a weak correlation between galaxy mass and total CGM metal retention
despite the fraction of metals lost from the halo increasing from $\sim10\%$ to
$>40\%$ towards lower masses. Our findings highlight the CGM (primarily its
warm component) as a key reservoir of mass and metals for dwarf galaxies across
stellar masses and underscore its importance in understanding the baryon cycle
in the low-mass regime. Finally, we provide individual galaxy properties of our
full sample and quantify the fraction of ultraviolet observable mass to support
future observational programs, particularly those aimed at performing a metal
budget around dwarf galaxies.

**TL;DR**: 本文首次系统分析了z~3.5的X射线选活动星系核（AGN）的电离外流性质，发现其与文献中z~3的结果一致，表明外流物理机制在z>3时无显著演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 活动星系核（AGN）是星系演化的关键因素，可能通过产生强大的外流塑造星系生长。然而，对于宇宙正午（z>3）后中等光度AGN（logLbol[erg/s]<47）的电离外流知之甚少。

Data: 研究使用了COSMOS-Legacy场中z~3.5、logLbol[erg/s]=45.2-46.7的X射线选AGN样本，以及JWST NIRSpec/IFU光谱观测数据。

Method: 通过多组分运动学分解静止光学发射线，光谱分离并空间解析电离外流。

Result: 研究发现GA-NIFS AGN的外流与文献结果一致，表明在固定光度下，外流总质量率、能量预算和外流速度无显著红移演化，且外流物理机制在z>3时无显著变化。

Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are a key ingredient in galaxy evolution,
possibly shaping galaxy growth through the generation of powerful outflows.
Little is known regarding AGN-driven ionized outflows in moderate-luminosity
AGN (logLbol[erg/s]<47) beyond cosmic noon (z>3). We present the first
systematic analysis of the ionized outflow properties of a sample of
X-ray-selected AGN (logLx[erg/s]>44) from the COSMOS-Legacy field at z~3.5 and
with logLbol[erg/s]=45.2-46.7, by using JWST NIRSpec/IFU spectroscopic
observations as part of the GA-NIFS program. We spectrally isolate and
spatially resolve the ionized outflows, by performing a multi-component
kinematic decomposition of the rest-frame optical emission lines. JWST/NIRSpec
IFU data also revealed a wealth of close-by companions, of both non-AGN and AGN
nature, and ionized gas streams likely tracing tidal structures and large-scale
ionized gas nebulae, extending up to the circum-galactic medium. Ionized
outflows are detected in all COS-AGN targets, which we compare with previous
results from the literature up to z~3, opportunely (re-)computed for a coherent
comparison. We normalize outflow energetics ($\dot{M}_{out}$, $\dot{E}_{out}$)
to the outflow density to standardize the various assumptions that were made in
the literature. Our choice is equal to assuming that each outflow has the same
gas density. We find GA-NIFS AGN to show outflows consistent with literature
results, within the large scatter shown by the collected measurements,
suggesting no strong evolution with redshift in terms of total mass outflow
rate, energy budget and outflow velocity for fixed bolometric luminosity.
Moreover, we find no clear redshift evolution of the ratio of mass outflow rate
and kinetic power over AGN bolometric luminosity beyond z>1. In general, our
results indicate no significant evolution of the physics driving outflows
beyond z~3. [abridged]

**TL;DR**: JWST观测表明，再电离时代的星系产生大量电离光子，但逃逸效率低，可能导致再电离时间较晚。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 早期JWST结果显示，再电离时代（EoR）的星系产生大量电离光子，如果这些光子高效逃逸，可能导致再电离过早发生。

Data: 使用JWST成像和棱镜光谱数据，分析了426个红移在4.5到9.0之间的星系。

Method: 通过结合恒星种群和星云发射模型，拟合数据，并引入电离光子逃逸分数f_esc参数。

Result: 研究发现，电离效率随红移增加和紫外光度降低而提高，但存在显著散射；平均逃逸分数为3±1%，且无演化迹象，表明大部分电离光子被吸收。再电离模拟显示，较暗星系对再电离贡献更大，与观测数据一致。

Abstract: Early results from JWST suggest that epoch-of-reionization (EoR) galaxies
produce copious ionizing photons, which, if they escape efficiently, could
cause reionization to occur too early. We study this problem using JWST imaging
and prism spectroscopy for 426 galaxies at 4.5 < z < 9.0. We fit these data
simultaneously with stellar--population and nebular--emission models that
include a parameter for the fraction of ionizing photons that escape the
galaxy, f_esc. We find that the ionization production efficiency,
$\xi_\mathrm{ion}$ = Q(H) / L(UV), increases with redshift and decreasing UV
luminosity, but shows significant scatter, $\sigma( \log \xi_\mathrm{ion})$ ~=
0.3 dex. The inferred escape fractions averaged over the population are
$\langle f_\mathrm{esc} \rangle$ = 3 +\pm 1% with no indication of evolution
over 4.5 < z < 9.0. This implies that in our models nearly all of the ionizing
photons need to be absorbed to account for the nebular emission. We compute the
impact of our results on reionization, including the distributions for
$\xi_\mathrm{ion}$ and f_esc, and the evolution and uncertainty of the UV
luminosity function. Considering galaxies brighter than M(UV) < -16 mag, we
would produce an IGM hydrogen-ionized fraction of x_e=0.5 at 5.5 < z < 7.1,
possibly too late compared to constraints from from QSO sightlines. Including
fainter galaxies, M(UV) < -14 mag, we obtain x_e = 0.5 at 6.7 < z < 9.6, fully
consistent with QSO and CMB data. This implies that EoR galaxies produce plenty
of ionizing photons, but these do not efficiently escape. This may be a result
of high gas column densities combined with burstier star-formation histories,
which limit the time massive stars are able to clear channels through the gas
for ionizing photons to escape.

**TL;DR**: 本研究通过对LBN 437彗星状星云的12CO和C18O分子线观测，揭示了其头部气体下落特征，表明其处于恒星形成的初始阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 亮缘彗星状星云是与HII区相关的压缩分子壳残余，暴露于OB型恒星的紫外辐射下，研究其分子气体与电离辐射的相互作用有助于理解其动态演化。

Data: 使用Taeduk射电天文台（TRAO）观测的12CO和C18O分子线的第一旋转跃迁数据。

Method: 通过气体运动学分析，研究LBN 437彗星状星云的分子气体动力学特征。

Result: LBN 437彗星状星云的头部显示出气体下落特征，平均下落速度为0.25 km s^-1，质量下落速率为5.08 * 10^-1 Msun yr^-1，与中或大质量恒星形成的研究结果一致。

Abstract: Bright-rimmed, cometary-shaped star-forming globules, associated with HII
regions, are remnants of compressed molecular shells exposed to ultraviolet
radiation from central OB-type stars. The interplay between dense molecular gas
and ionizing radiation, analysed through gas kinematics, provides significant
insights into the nature and dynamic evolution of these globules. This study
presents the results of a kinematic analysis of the cometary globule, Lynds
Bright Nebula (LBN) 437, focusing on the first rotational transition of 12CO
and C18O molecular lines observed using the Taeduk Radio Astronomy Observatory
(TRAO). The averaged 12CO spectrum shows a slightly skewed profile, suggesting
the possibility of a contracting cloud. The molecular gas kinematics reveals
signatures of infalling gas in the cometary head of LBN 437, indicating the
initial stages of star formation. The mean infall velocity and mass infall rate
towards the cometary head of LBN 437 are 0.25 km s^-1 and 5.08 * 10^-1 Msun
yr^-1 respectively, which align well with the previous studies on intermediate
or high-mass star formation.

Result: Error

Abstract: We present JWST NIRCam observations of the emerging young star clusters
(eYSCs) detected in the nearby spiral galaxy M83. The NIRcam mosaic encompasses
the nuclear starburst, the bar, and the inner spiral arms. The eYSCs, detected
in Pa$\alpha$ and Br$\alpha$ maps, have been largely missed in previous optical
campaigns of young star clusters (YSCs). We distinguish between eYSCI, if they
also have compact 3.3~$\mu$m PAH emission associated to them, and eYSCII, if
they only appear as compact Pa$\alpha$ emitters. We find that the variations in
the 3.3~$\mu$m PAH feature are consistent with an evolutionary sequence where
eYSCI evolve into eYSCII and then optical YSCs. This sequence is clear in the
F300M-F335M (tracing the excess in the \PAHlambda\ feature) and the F115W-F187N
(tracing the excess in Pa$\alpha$) colors which become increasingly bluer as
clusters emerge. The central starburst stands out as the region where the most
massive eYSCs are currently forming in the galaxy. We estimate that only about
20~\% of the eYSCs will remain detectable as compact YSCs. Combining eYSCs and
YSCs ($\leq$10 Myr) we recover an average clearing timescale of 6~Myr in which
clusters transition from embedded to fully exposed. We see evidence of shorter
emergence timescales ($\sim$5~Myr) for more massive ($>5\times10^3$ \msun)
clusters, while star clusters of $\sim 10^3$ \msun\ about 7~Myr. We estimate
that eYSCs remain associated to the \PAHlambda\ emission 3--4~Myr. Larger
samples of eYSC and YSC populations will provide stronger statistics to further
test environmental and cluster mass dependencies on the emergence timescale.

*Jin Koda,Fumi Egusa,Akihiko Hirota,Amanda M Lee,Tsuyoshi Sawada,Fumiya Maeda*

**TL;DR**: 研究利用ALMA的高分辨率数据揭示了M83星系中CO J=2-1/1-0线比（R21）随星系结构变化的系统性规律，表明分子气体的密度和/或动力学温度受星系结构和动力学主导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域对星系中分子气体性质的理解尚不完善，尤其是星系结构和动力学如何影响分子气体的物理条件。M83作为典型的棒旋星系，为研究这一问题提供了理想样本。

Data: 使用了ALMA提供的46 pc分辨率数据。

Method: 通过分析CO J=2-1/1-0线比（R21）的空间分布，结合星系结构和动力学特征进行研究。

Result: 研究发现R21在星系不同区域（如棒、旋臂、星系中心）呈现系统性变化，表明分子气体的密度和/或动力学温度受星系结构和动力学主导，且恒星反馈的影响有限。

Abstract: We show the variations of the CO J=2-1/1-0 line ratio (R21) across the barred
spiral galaxy M83, using the 46 pc resolution data from ALMA. The R21 map
clearly evidences the systematic large-scale variations as a function of
galactic structures. Azimuthally, it starts from low R21<~0.7 in the interarm
regions and becomes high ~>0.7 in the bar and spiral arms, suggesting that the
density and/or kinetic temperature of molecular gas increase by about a factor
of 2-3. This evolution is seen even in the parts of spiral arms without star
formation, and R21 is often elevated even higher to ~0.8-1.0 when HII regions
exist in the vicinity. Radially, R21 starts very high >~1.0 at the galactic
center, remains low <~0.7 in the bar region, increases to >~0.7 around the bar
end, and again decreases to <~0.7 in the rest of disk where the spiral arms
dominate. The evolutionary sequence is synchronized with galactic rotation, and
therefore, it is determined largely by the galactic structures and dynamics and
is governed by the galactic rotation timescales. The R21 map also shows that
the influence of stellar feedback is localized and limited. Massive, large, and
non-star forming molecular structures have low R21, which also suggests that
the bulk molecular gas in the disk is not regulated by stellar feedback, but
more likely by galactic structures and dynamics. These results are consistent
with suggestions by the earlier studies of the Milky Way and other barred
spiral galaxies, and thus, are likely general among barred spiral galaxies in
the local Universe.

**TL;DR**: 本文通过对Green Pea星系J0822+2241进行深度X射线观测，首次提供了低光度活动星系核（AGN）存在的证据，并探讨了其对宇宙再电离时期的潜在贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Green Pea星系是宇宙中一类紧凑、低质量、低金属丰度的恒星形成星系，被认为是高红移星系的类似物。尽管JWST在高红移星系中发现了AGN的证据，但在低红移类似物中尚未通过X射线观测确认AGN的存在。

Data: 使用X射线观测数据，特别是对SDSS J082247.66+224144.0（J0822+2241）进行的6.2年（静止参考系）深度观测。

Method: 通过分析X射线光谱形状和光度变化，探讨了J0822+2241的X射线特性。

Result: 研究发现J0822+2241的2-10 keV光度稳定，而0.5-2 keV通量显著下降约60%，支持了AGN周围存在低柱密度遮蔽的假设，为低光度AGN在宇宙再电离时期的贡献提供了证据。

Abstract: Green Pea galaxies are a class of compact, low-mass, low-metallicity
star-forming galaxies in the relatively local universe. They are believed to be
analogues of high-redshift galaxies that re-ionised the universe and, indeed,
the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now uncovering such populations at
record redshifts. Intriguingly, JWST finds evidence suggestive of active
galactic nuclei (AGN) in many of these distant galaxies, including the elusive
Little Red Dots, that broadly lack any detectable X-ray counterparts.
Intuitively, one would expect to detect an AGN in their low-redshift analogues
with X-rays, yet no study to date has conclusively identified an X-ray AGN
within a Green Pea galaxy. Here we present the deepest X-ray campaign of a
Green Pea galaxy performed to date, obtained with the goal of discerning the
presence of a (potentially low-luminosity) AGN. The target $-$ SDSS J082247.66
+224144.0 (J0822+2241 hereafter) $-$ was previously found to display a
comparable X-ray spectral shape to more local AGN ($\Gamma$ $\sim$ 2) and a
high luminosity ($L_{2-10\,{\rm keV}}$ $\sim$ 10$^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$). We show
that over 6.2 years (rest-frame), the 2$-$10 keV luminosity of J0822+2241 is
constant, whereas the soft 0.5$-$2 keV flux has decreased significantly by
$\sim$60%. We discuss possible scenarios to explain the X-ray properties of
J0822+2241, finding transient low-column density obscuration surrounding an AGN
to be the only plausible scenario. J0822+2241 thus provides further evidence
that low-luminosity AGN activity could have contributed to the epoch of
reionisation, and that local analogues are useful to derive a complete
multi-wavelength picture of black hole growth in high redshift low luminosity
AGN.

**TL;DR**: 通过ALMA总功率阵列对12个附近星系进行12CO(J=1-0)映射观测，研究发现12CO(J=2-1)/12CO(J=1-0)线比r21在运动异常区域显著高于正常旋转盘，且星系棒的存在影响r21的径向梯度分布。

Background: 研究背景包括对附近星系中12CO(J=1-0)和12CO(J=2-1)线比r21的观测及其在星系动力学中的意义，以及现有研究中对星系棒对r21影响的探索不足。

Data: 使用了来自FACTS（Fundamental CO 1-0 Transition Survey of nearby galaxies）的12个附近星系的12CO(J=1-0)映射观测数据。

Method: 通过位置-速度图和倾斜环模型分离正常旋转盘与运动异常区域，并比较不同星系类型（SA、SAB、SB）的r21及其径向梯度。

Result: 研究发现r21在运动异常区域显著高于正常旋转盘，星系棒的存在导致r21径向梯度呈双峰分布，SA星系梯度平缓，而SB星系梯度陡峭且在恒星棒半径后趋于平缓。

Abstract: We present 12CO(J=1-0) mapping observations over ~1/2 of the optical disk of
12 nearby galaxies from the Fundamental CO 1-0 Transition Survey of nearby
galaxies (FACTS), using the ALMA Total Power array. Variations in the
12CO(J=2-1)/12CO(J=1-0) line ratio r21 are investigated. The
luminosity-weighted r21 of the 11 sample galaxies ranges from 0.52 to 0.69 with
an average of 0.61. We use position-velocity diagrams along the major axis and
tilted ring models to separate the normal rotating galactic disk from kinematic
outliers that deviate from pure circular rotation. We find that r21 is
systematically higher in outliers compared to the disk. We compare r21 between
SA, SAB and SB galaxies, and find no significant difference in the average r21
depending on the presence of galactic bars. We find, however, that the radial
gradient in r21 is bimodal, where a group containing all SA galaxies prefer
constant or very shallow r21 gradients out 40% of the optical radius, while
another group containing all SB galaxies have a steep r21 gradient, decreasing
by ~20% before 40% of the optical radius, which also corresponds to the radius
of the stellar bar. After this radius, these galaxies become consistent with a
constant or shallow trend in r21. The large scale trend in r21 can have
implications for how we interpret observations made solely in the 12CO(J=2-1)
line.

Abstract: Giant radio galaxies (GRG) are radio galaxies with physical sizes of their
radio emission larger than 0.7 Mpc. Recently, the sample of GRGs has become
large enough to study the extreme end of the GRG size distribution. We examine
the properties of GRGs with largest linear sizes larger than 3 Mpc in order to
shed light on the nature and origin of GRGs. We select, corroborate, and revise
if necessary, the largest GRGs from literature. We add to these the GRGs we
identified in our own search, combined with optical surveys and catalogues of
spectroscopic and photometric redshifts in order to find their projected linear
radio size. We study their radio power--size relation, the asymmetry in the
lobes, their association with clusters of galaxies, as well as their bending
angles.
  We present an unprecedented sample of 143 GRGs larger than 3 Mpc, of which 69
were newly found by us. The sample includes six GRGs with projected linear
sizes clearly exceeding 5 Mpc and reaching up to 6.6 Mpc. We find that GRGs
larger than 3 Mpc are distributed in redshift and radio luminosity
indistinguishable from those of smaller GRGs. At most a single one of the GRGs
larger than 3 Mpc can be classified as a clear Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type I
source, and only 6 per cent deviate from a clear FR II radio morphology. One
quarter of our GRGs show very diffuse lobes typical for remnant radio galaxies,
and only 59 per cent show indications of hotspots in at least one lobe, with 38
per cent featuring a hotspot in both lobes. As in the case of smaller radio
galaxies, the shorter lobe is most often also the brighter one. We find
tentative evidence that the bending angle decreases with size of the GRG, but
no trend with redshift is detected. The bending angles of GRGs > 3 Mpc in known
clusters are larger than for those GRGs not associated with clusters.

**TL;DR**: 通过JWST和ALMA联合观测高红移星系，研究发现光学和远红外线密度测量存在差异，揭示了星系中高密度和低密度气体的共存，并强调了结合光学与远红外线对早期宇宙金属丰度准确测定的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 高红移星系的星际介质（ISM）性质研究是理解早期宇宙星系演化的关键，但目前对星系中气体密度和金属丰度的测量方法存在差异，尤其是光学和远红外线观测结果的不一致性。

Data: 使用JWST/NIRSpec IFU光谱仪观测了三个红移z=6-7的星系，检测了关键的光学发射线（如[OII]λλ3726,3729和[OIII]λ4363），并通过ALMA Band 9/10观测了[OIII]52μm和[OIII]88μm线。

Method: 结合JWST和ALMA的观测数据，通过光学和远红外线发射线的联合分析，采用2-区模型（高密度和低密度区域）来解释观测结果，并评估了直接-Te方法在金属丰度测定中的局限性。

Result: 研究发现光学和远红外线测量的电子密度存在系统性差异（光学测量约为1000 cm−3，远红外线测量低于500 cm−3），表明星系中存在高密度和低密度气体的共存；同时发现直接-Te方法可能低估金属丰度达0.8 dex，强调了结合光学和远红外线数据的重要性。

Abstract: We present a JWST and ALMA detailed study of the ISM properties of
high-redshift galaxies. Our JWST/NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy targeting three
galaxies at $z=6-7$ detects key rest-frame optical emission lines, allowing us
to derive [OII]$\lambda\lambda$3726,3729-based electron densities of
$n_\mathrm{e,optical}\sim1000$ cm$^{-3}$ on average and
[OIII]$\lambda$4363-based metallicities of $\mathrm{12+log(O/H)}=8.0-8.2$ in
two galaxies. New ALMA Band 9/10 observations detect the [OIII]52$\mu$m line in
one galaxy but do not in the others, resulting in FIR-based densities of
$n_\mathrm{e,FIR}\lesssim500$ cm$^{-3}$ from the [OIII]52$\mu$m/[OIII]88$\mu$m
ratios, systematically lower than the optical [OII]-based measurements. These
low FIR-based densities are comparable to those at both $z\sim0$ and $z>6$ in
the literature, including JADES-GS-z14-0 at $z=14.18$, suggesting little
evolution up to $z\sim14$, in contrast to the increasing trend of optical-based
densities with redshift. By conducting a JWST and ALMA joint analysis using
emission lines detected with both telescopes, we find that the observed FIR
[OIII]52,88$\mu$m luminosities are too high to be explained by the
optical-based densities at which they would be significantly collisionally
de-excited. Instead, a 2-zone model with distinct high- and low-density regions
is required to reproduce all observed lines, indicating that FIR [OIII]
emission arises predominantly from low-density gas, while optical [OIII] and
[OII] lines trace both regions. We further demonstrate that the
direct-$T_\mathrm{e}$ method can sometimes significantly underestimate
metallicities up to 0.8 dex due to the presence of the low-density gas not
fully traced by optical lines alone, highlighting the importance of combining
optical and FIR lines to accurately determine gas-phase metallicities in the
early universe.

Background: 暗物质的本质仍然是一个谜，自相互作用暗物质（SIDM）作为候选者可能解决冷暗物质范式中的一些问题。

Data: 使用了脉冲星计时阵列（PTAs）的数据。

Method: 采用了改进的动态摩擦公式，并一致地演化了轨道动力学，同时考虑了超大质量黑洞双星（SMBHBs）的偏心度。

Result: 研究发现当前PTAs数据对SIDM的截面敏感度可达σ(v)/mχ≲0.66 cm²/g，与其他天体物理探测手段相当，并揭示了PTAs观测在探测暗物质性质中的潜力。

Abstract: The nature of dark matter is still mysterious despite various astronomical
evidence. As a possible candidate, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can
potentially resolve some issues appearing in cold dark matter paradigm. Here we
investigate how SIDM around supermassive black holes (SMBH) in galaxy centers
may form a density spike and imprint in the spectrum shape of stochastic
gravitational-wave background from SMBH binaries (SMBHBs). Employing a refined
dynamical friction formula and consistently evolving the orbital dynamics, we
demonstrate that current pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) data is sensitive to the
cross section of SIDM with
$\sigma(v)/m_\chi\lesssim0.66\,\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$, comparable to other
astrophysical probes. We also highlight the importance of including the
eccentricity of SMBHBs in the parameter inference, which would affect the
results significantly. Our findings reveal the promising potential of PTAs
observations in probing the nature of dark matter.

**TL;DR**: 本文利用LAMOST和SDSS/SEGUE的K巨星（KG）以及SDSS的蓝水平分支（BHB）恒星，结合Gaia DR3的自行数据，研究了银河系暗物质晕的密度分布、形状和维里质量，发现暗物质晕的形状随银心距离演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 银河系暗物质晕的性质（如密度分布、形状和质量）是天文学中的重要研究课题，但目前对其结构的理解仍存在不确定性。本文旨在通过多种动力学模型和恒星数据，进一步揭示暗物质晕的分布特征。

Data: 使用了LAMOST和SDSS/SEGUE的K巨星（KG）数据、SDSS的蓝水平分支（BHB）恒星数据，以及Gaia DR3的自行数据。

Method: 采用了轴对称的Jeans方程结合多高斯展开（MGE）和球对称的Jeans各向异性模型（JAM sph），并允许不同的扁平暗物质密度模型。通过单独或同时拟合KG和BHB数据来约束暗物质分布。

Result: 研究发现暗物质晕的形状随银心距离演化，扁平参数在20 kpc以内减小，20 kpc以外增大。总质量在60 kpc内为0.533×10^12 M⊙，r200为188±15 kpc，M200为0.820×10^12 M⊙。KG和BHB数据在约束暗物质分布时表现出一致性。

Abstract: We explore the density profile, shape, and virial mass of the Milky Way's
dark matter halo using K giants (KG) from LAMOST and SDSS/SEGUE, as well as
blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars from SDSS. Incorporating Gaia DR3 proper
motions, we first investigate the velocity ellipsoid distribution within the
$(R, |z|)$ space. The ellipsoids projected onto the $(v_R, v_z)$ plane exhibit
near-spherical alignment. We then probe the underlying dark matter distribution
using the axisymmetric Jeans equations with multi-Gaussian expansion (MGE) and
the spherically aligned Jeans anisotropic modelling (JAM${\rm sph}$), allowing
for different flattened dark matter density models. For each model, we apply
two fitting approaches: fitting the KGs and BHBs separately or fit them
simultaneously as two dynamical tracers in one gravitational potential. We find
consistent results on the dark matter density profiles, $r_{200}$, and
$M_{200}$ within a 1-$\sigma$ confidence region for models constrained by KGs,
BHBs, and both. We find the strongest consistency between KGs and BHBs in
constraining dark matter profiles for models incorporating radially varying
halo flattening ($q(r_{\rm gc})$), which suggests the Milky Way's dark matter
halo shape evolves with Galactocentric distance ($r_{\rm gc}$). Specifically,
the halo flattening parameter $q_h$ decreases within $r_{\rm gc} < 20$ kpc and
increases for $r_{\rm gc} > 20$ kpc. In this model, $M_{\rm tot} (< 60~{\rm
kpc}) = 0.533^{+0.061}_{-0.054} \times 10^{12}$ $M_{\odot}$, $r_{200}$ is
$188\pm15$ kpc, with $M_{200}$ estimated at $0.820^{+0.210}_{-0.186} \times
10^{12} M_{\odot}$.

Abstract: The well-known discrepancy in galactic rotation curves refers to the mismatch
between observed rotational velocities and the velocities predicted by baryonic
matter. In this study we investigate a potential pattern in the discrepancy,
which may point to an underlying pattern in dark-halo distributions. By looking
at rotational-velocity curves from an alternate perspective, the
angular-velocity curves, it appears that the observed angular velocities and
their corresponding baryonic predictions differ by a constant shift. That is,
the discrepancy may be reduced to a constant angular-velocity term, independent
of the radius. We test the generality of the suggested property by analysing
143 high-quality rotation curves. The property appears significant as it
performs equally well (or better) than well-established dark-halo models.
Compared to a Burkert profile, it is preferred in 60% of the cases, while
relative to a Navarro Frenk White profile (NFW), it is superior in 73% of the
cases. Next, by including the new phenomenological property within the
dynamical equations, we find an explicit expression for the dark-halo profile.
The new single-parameter profile is characterised by a remarkable property: it
is intrinsically related to the baryonic distribution. Thus, information
regarding the cuspy or cored nature of a particular dark halo, according to
this profile, is encoded (and explicitly determined) by the respective baryonic
behaviour.

Background: 高红移的'小红点'（LRDs）是一类具有红色UV至光学颜色和宽巴尔默线的致密天体，为早期活动星系核（AGN）的研究提供了新视角。其巴尔默吸收和强巴尔默断裂特征可能与超质量黑洞（SMBH）被高密度气体包裹有关。

Method: 通过VLT/MUSE观测分析A2744-45924的Lyα和Hα发射特征，并结合JWST的Hα点源数据，探讨其物理起源和周围环境的影响。

Result: 研究发现A2744-45924的Lyα发射与Hα发射具有不同的物理起源（Hα来自AGN，Lyα来自恒星形成），且周围环境中的Lyα晕未受其辐射影响，表明SMBH被高密度气体遮蔽。

Abstract: The abundant population of "Little Red Dots" (LRDs)-compact objects with red
UV to optical colors and broad Balmer lines at high redshift-is unveiling new
insights into the properties of early active galactic nuclei (AGN). Perhaps the
most surprising features of this population are the presence of Balmer
absorption and ubiquitous strong Balmer breaks. Recent models link these
features to an active supermassive black hole (SMBH) cocooned in very dense gas
($N_{\rm H}\sim10^{24}\,\rm cm^{-2}$). We present a stringent test of such
models using VLT/MUSE observations of A2744-45924, the most luminous LRD known
to date ($L_{\rm H\alpha}\approx10^{44}~\rm erg\,s^{-1}$), located behind the
Abell-2744 lensing cluster at $z=4.464$ ($\mu=1.8$). We detect a moderately
extended Ly$\alpha$ nebula ($h\approx5.7$ pkpc), spatially offset from the
point-like H$\alpha$ seen by JWST. The Ly$\alpha$ emission is narrow ($\rm
FWHM=270\pm 15~km\,s^{-1}$), spatially offset to H$\alpha$, and faint ($\rm
Ly\alpha=0.07H\alpha$) compared to Ly$\alpha$ nebulae typically observed around
quasars of similar luminosity. We detect compact N$\,$IV]$\lambda$1486
emission, spatially aligned with H$\alpha$, and a spatial shift in the far-UV
continuum matching the Ly$\alpha$ offset. We discuss that H$\alpha$ and
Ly$\alpha$ have distinct physical origins: H$\alpha$ originates from the AGN,
while Ly$\alpha$ is powered by star formation. In the environment of
A2744-45924, we identify four extended Ly$\alpha$ halos ($\Delta z<0.02$,
$\Delta r<100$ pkpc). Their Ly$\alpha$ luminosities match expectations based on
H$\alpha$ emission, indicating no evidence for radiation from A2744-45924
affecting its surroundings. The lack of strong, compact, and broad Ly$\alpha$
and the absence of a luminous extended halo, suggest that the UV AGN light is
obscured by dense gas cloaking the SMBH with covering factor close to unity.

Background: 磁场的角动量传输对原行星盘的形成和演化至关重要，但非理想磁流体动力学效应（如双极扩散和欧姆耗散）会抑制磁场作用，这些效应依赖于电离程度。宇宙射线是星形成云中主要的电离源，其分布受气体密度和磁场影响，导致宇宙射线、磁场和气体之间相互作用。

Abstract: Angular momentum transport by magnetic fields is important for formation and
evolution of protoplanetary disks. The effects of magnetic fields are
suppressed due to non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects such as ambipolar
diffusion and Ohmic dissipation, which depend on the degree of ionization.
Cosmic rays (CRs) are the primary source of ionization in star-forming clouds,
and their distribution is nonuniform as it is affected by gas density and
magnetic fields. Therefore, CRs, magnetic fields, and gas interact with each
other. In this work, we develop a new fully implicit cosmic ray transport
module in Athena++ and perform three-dimensional simulations of disk formation
from collapse of molecular cloud cores. Since CRs are strongly attenuated in
the dense gas at the disk scale, distribution of magnetic fields is
considerably altered compared to conventional models assuming a uniform
ionization rate. While the total magnetic fluxes accreted onto the disks remain
similar as the gas outside the disks remain sufficiently ionized and well
coupled, the magnetic fields in the disks are less twisted due to the stronger
non-ideal MHD effects. As a consequence, magnetic angular momentum transport is
strongly suppressed at the disk scale, resulting in more gravitationally
unstable disks with more prominent spiral arms. Our simulations demonstrate
influence of non-uniform ionization resulting from CR transport and attenuation
on the disk formation and evolution.

Abstract: Recurrent novae undergo thermonuclear-powered eruptions separated by less
than 100 years, enabled by subgiant or red giant donors transferring
hydrogen-rich matter at very high rates onto their massive white dwarf
companions. The most-rapidly moving parts of envelopes ejected in successive
recurrent nova events are predicted to overtake and collide with the slowest
ejecta of the previous eruption, leading to the buildup of vast (~ 10 - 100
parsec) super-remnants surrounding all recurrent novae; but only three examples
are currently known. We report deep narrowband imaging and spectroscopy which
has revealed a ~ 70-parsec-diameter shell surrounding the frequently recurring
nova RS Ophiuchi. We estimate the super-remnant mass to be ~ 20 - 200 solar
masses, expanding at a few tens of km/s, with an age of order 50-100 kyr. Its
extremely low surface brightness and large angular size help explain the
hitherto surprising absence of nova super-remnants. Our results support the
prediction that ALL recurrent novae are surrounded by similar extended
structures.

Abstract: Important scientific discoveries should be backed by high statistical
significance. In the 2030s, multiple space-based gravitational wave detectors
are expected to operate. While many works aim to achieve quick and reliable
detection and parameter estimation of millihertz gravitational wave sources,
dedicated studies are lacking to assess the significance of space-based
detectors. In this work, we propose a framework to assess the statistical
significance of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) detections with space-based
gravitational wave detectors. We apply this algorithm to simulated data with
Gaussian stationary noise and the complex LDC-2a dataset to measure the false
alarm rate and significance of MBHB signals. We also analyze factors affecting
the significance of MBHBs and design a method to mitigate multi-source
confusion interference. In Gaussian noise conditions, MBHBs with a
signal-to-noise ratio of about 7 can achieve $3 \sigma$ significance, and those
with a signal-to-noise ratio of about 8 achieve $4 \sigma$. Our analysis
demonstrates that all MBHB signals in the LDC-2a dataset have a significance
exceeding $4.62 \sigma$.

Abstract: Debris discs provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of
exoplanetary systems. Their structures are commonly attributed to planetary
perturbations, serving as probes of as-yet-undetected planets. However, most
studies of planet-debris disc interactions ignore the disc's gravity, treating
it as a collection of massless planetesimals. Here, using an analytical model,
we investigate how the vertical structure of a back-reacting debris disc
responds to secular perturbations from an inner, inclined planet. Considering
the disc's axisymmetric potential, we identify two dynamical regimes:
planet-dominated and disc-dominated, which may coexist, separated by a
secular-inclination resonance. In the planet-dominated regime ($M_d/m_p\ll1$),
we recover the classical result: a transient warp propagates outward until the
disc settles into a box-like structure centered around the planetary orbit's
initial inclination $I_p(0)$, with a distance-independent aspect ratio
$\mathcal{H}(R)\approx I_p(0)$. In contrast, in the disc-dominated regime
($M_d/m_p\gtrsim1$), the disc exhibits dynamical rigidity, remaining thin and
misaligned, with significantly suppressed inclinations and a sharply declining
aspect ratio, $\mathcal{H}(R)\propto I_p(0)R^{-7/2}$. In the intermediate
regime ($M_d/m_p\lesssim1$), the system exhibits a secular-inclination
resonance, leading to long-lived, warp-like structures and a bimodal
inclination distribution, containing both dynamically hot and cold populations.
We provide analytic formulae describing these effects as a function of system
parameters. We also find that the vertical density profile is intrinsically
non-Gaussian and recommend fitting observations with non-zero slopes of
$\mathcal{H}(R)$. Our results may be used to infer planetary parameters and
debris disc masses based on observed warps and scale heights, as demonstrated
for HD110058 and $\beta$ Pic.

Abstract: We explore the potential of the expanding ejecta method (EEM) as a
cosmological probe, leveraging its ability to measure angular diameter
distances to supernovae (SNe) with intensity interferometry. We propose three
distinct applications of the EEM: (1) using Type IIP SNe as moderate-distance
geometric anchors to calibrate Cepheids, replacing other local distance
indicators; (2) directly calibrating Type Ia SNe, bypassing conventional
calibration methods; (3) constructing a fully independent Hubble diagram with
Type IIP (Type Ia) SNe, entirely decoupled from the traditional distance
ladder. Incorporating realistic SN populations, we forecast a Hubble constant
precision with next-generation intensity interferometers of $1.6\%$, $1.1\%$,
and $9.3\% \,(3.6\%)$, respectively, for the three different proposed
applications. Future intensity interferometry could yield improvements to
$1.2\%$, $0.6\%$, and $1.5\%\,(0.4\%)$. The EEM thus offers a powerful
geometric alternative for cosmic distance determination.

Abstract: Evidence indicates that supermassive black holes exist at the centers of most
galaxies. Their mass correlates with the galactic bulge mass, suggesting a
co-evolution with their host galaxies, most likely through powerful winds.
X-ray observations have detected highly ionized winds outflowing at
sub-relativistic speeds from the accretion disks around supermassive black
holes. However, the limited spectral resolution of current X-ray instruments
has left the physical structure and location of the winds poorly understood,
hindering accurate estimates of their kinetic power. Here, the first XRISM
observation of the luminous quasar, PDS 456, is reported. The high-resolution
spectrometer Resolve onboard XRISM enabled the discovery of five discrete
velocity components outflowing at 20-30% of the speed of light. This
demonstrates that the wind structure is highly inhomogeneous, which likely
consists of up to a million clumps. The mass outflow rate is estimated to be
60-300 solar masses per year, with the wind kinetic power exceeding the
Eddington luminosity limit. Compared to the galaxy-scale outflows, the kinetic
power is more than 3 orders of magnitude larger, while the momentum flux is 10
times larger. These estimates disfavor both energy- and momentum-driven outflow
models. It suggests that such wind activity occurs in less than 10% of the
quasar phase and/or that its energy/momentum is not efficiently transferred to
the galaxy-scale outflows due to the clumpiness of the wind and the
interstellar medium.
