We analyze bright ($G<13$) and metal-poor\n([Fe/H]$<-1.2$) stars located far from the disk ($|z|\\geq1$ kpc), and explore a\ntotal of $19$ abundances. We find that $9$ different abundances exhibit a\ndrastic transition in their distribution near the Solar radius $r_{\\rm GC}=8$\nkpc. This trend is very unlikely to be related to radial migration, as our\nmetal-poor sample does not contain any disk star. We also analyze the\nGaia-Sausage/Enceladus stars, which is a dominant metal-poor population of the\nGalaxy, and find that it alone cannot account for this trend.

In this\nwork, we present a new method for testing the presence of non-Gaussian features\nin PTA data. We go beyond the Gaussian assumption by modeling the noise or\nsignal statistics using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). An advantage of this\napproach is that the marginalization of the likelihood remains fully\nanalytical, expressed as a linear combination of Gaussian PTA likelihoods. This\nmakes the method straightforward to implement within existing data analysis\ntools. Moreover, this method extends beyond the free spectrum analysis by\nproducing posterior probability distributions of higher-order moments inferred\nfrom the data, which can be incorporated into spectral refitting techniques. We\nvalidate the model using simulations and demonstrate the sensitivity of PTAs to\nnon-Gaussianity by computing the Bayes factor in favor of the GMM as a function\nof the injected excess moments.

By inverting the RUBIES selection\nfunction, we correct for survey incompleteness and calculate the number density\nof massive quiescent galaxies at these redshifts, providing the most complete\nspectroscopic estimates prior to cosmic noon to date. We find that early\nmassive quiescent galaxies are surprisingly common ($\\gtrsim 10^{-5}$\nMpc$^{-3}$ by $4<z<5$), which is consistent with previous studies based on JWST\nphotometry alone and/or in smaller survey areas. We compare our number\ndensities with predictions from six state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy\nformation simulations. At $z>3$, most simulations fail to produce enough\nmassive quiescent galaxies, suggesting the treatment of feedback and/or the\nchannels for early efficient formation are incomplete in most galaxy evolution\nmodels."}

Increased mass reduction\nwhilst maintaining mechanical performance can be achieved through the creation\nof intricate lattice geometries, which are impossible to manufacture\nconventionally. Further, part consolidation can be introduced to reduce the\nnumber of interfaces and thereby points of failure. AM design optimisation\nusing computational tools has been extensively covered in existing literature.\nHowever, additional research, specifically evaluation of the optical surface,\nis required to qualify these results before these advantages can be realised.\nThis paper outlines the development & metrology of an AM mirror for a CubeSat\nplatform with a targeted mass reduction of 60% compared to an equivalent solid\nbody. This project aims to incorporate recent developments in AM mirror design,\nwith a focus on manufacture, testing & evaluation. This is achieved through a\nsimplified design process of a Cassegrain telescope primary mirror mounted\nwithin a 3U CubeSat chassis. The mirror geometry is annular with an external\ndiameter of 84 mm and an internal diameter of 32 mm; the optical prescription\nis flat for ease of manufacture. Prototypes were printed in AlSi10Mg, a\nlow-cost aluminium alloy commonly used in metal additive manufacturing. They\nwere then machined and single-point diamond turned to achieve a reflective\nsurface. Both quantitative & qualitative evaluations of the optical surface\nwere conducted to assess the effect of hot isostatic pressing (HIP) on the\noptical surface quality. The results indicated that HIP reduced surface\nporosity; however, it also increased surface roughness and, consequently,\noptical scatter."}

Planetary systems that have\nbeen scattered into orbits of sufficiently high eccentricity can undergo tidal\ncircularisation, with Hot Jupiter formation being one possible stopping\ncondition. We also account for the possibility of (i) ionisation due to\nhigh-energy encounters, (ii) tidal disruption of the planet by tidal forces\ninside the Roche limit and (iii) Warm Jupiter formation. The orbital evolution\nof a population of cold Jupiter progenitors, with initial semi-major axes\nbetween 1-30 au, is simulated over 12 Gyr using a simplified dynamical model of\n47 Tuc. Our computational treatment of dynamical encounters yields an overall\nHJ occurrence rate of F_HJ = 5.9 x 10^-4 per cluster star (a 51 per cent\nenhancement relative to the analytic baseline). The probability of Hot Jupiter\nformation is highest in the core and falls off steeply beyond a few parsecs\nfrom the centre of the cluster, where the stellar density is too low to drive\nefficient eccentricity diffusion.

These kernels are generated through a linear combination of\nother SPH kernels, combined with an optimization strategy to minimize the error\nin the Gresho-Chan vortex test case. To facilitate the different choices in\ngradient operators for SPH in the literature, we perform this optimization for\nboth geometric density average force SPH (GDSPH) and linear-corrected gradient\nSPH (ISPH). In addition to the Gresho-Chan vortex, we also perform simulations\nof the hydrostatic glass, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and the Sod shocktube\ncase. At low neighbour numbers (< 128), there is a significant improvement\nacross the different tests, with the greatest impact shown for GDSPH. Apart\nfrom the popular Wendland kernels, we also explore other positive-definite\nkernels in this paper, which include the \"missing\" Wendland kernels, Wu\nkernels, and Buhmann kernels. In addition, we also present a method for\nproducing arbitrary non-biased initial conditions in SPH. This method uses the\nSPH momentum equation together with an artificial pressure, combined with a\nglobal and local relaxation stage to minimize local and global errors."}

A total of 345 stars are\nselected as genuine members using the published lists of X-ray, infrared\nsources, and early-type stars as well as the Gaia data. There is severe\ndifferential reddening across this region and the reddening law of the\nintracluster medium appears abnormal. The distance to M16, derived from the\nparallaxes of the members, is about 1.7 kpc. The ages of members, estimated by\ncomparing their color-magnitude diagram with theoretical isochrones, range from\n1 Myr to 4 Myr. This star-forming region is composed of an open cluster (NGC\n6611) and a distributed population. This cluster shows a clear pattern of\nexpansion and rotation. Some of the distributed population are spatially\nassociated with the gas pillars located at the ridge of H II bubble. In\nparticular, several stars moving away from the cluster are physically\nassociated with the northeastern pillar. In addition, their younger ages\nsupport the idea that the formation of these stars was triggered by the\nfeedback from massive stars in NGC 6611. On the other hand, the other stars do\nnot show systematic radial or stream motions; therefore, they likely formed\nthrough spontaneous star formation events. We discuss the formation of young\nstars in the context of cluster expansion, spontaneous star formation, and\nfeedback-driven star formation, and suggest that all of these mechanisms\npossibly contributed to their formation."}

We present high-precision stellar parameters and\nA(Li) for 22 new comoving pairs, primarily located on the hotter side of the\nLi-Dip. Combined with pairs from the C3PO catalog, our sample includes 124\nstars with Teff between 6000 and 7300 K, encompassing and extending slightly\nbeyond the Li-Dip. Among them, 49 comoving pairs (98 stars) have both\ncomponents within the temperature range of interest. Using this expanded set of\ncomoving pairs observed with high-resolution spectroscopy, we show that\nrotational spin-down is the dominant process responsible for Li depletion in\nthe Li-Dip. First, within comoving pairs, the star with v sin i > 12 km/s shows\nhigher A(Li) than its more slowly rotating companion within the Li-Dip,\nindicating that rotation-dependent mixing drives lithium depletion. Second, we\nobserve a correlation between A(Li) and v sin i: fast rotators retain higher\nA(Li) with less scatter, while slow rotators show lower A(Li) and greater\ndispersion. Third, among slow rotators, A(Li) varies widely, suggesting that\ndifferences in initial rotation rates and spin-down histories influence how\nmuch Li is depleted. Some stars may have formed as fast rotators and spun down\nrapidly, leading to more Li depletion, while others may have started as slow\nrotators and retained more of their initial Li. These results demonstrate that\nrotational induced mixing plays an important role in shaping the Li-Dip beyond\nthe effects of stellar age and mass."}

In both simulations, we find that the\nquasar activity is quenched at a characteristic halo mass ($\\sim 10^{13}\nM_{\\odot}$) scale affecting the nature of its occupation distribution function.\nWe note that the quenching is more pronounced at low redshifts for quasars\nselected through a luminosity threshold. We show that a very significant bias\n({\\bf a factor of $\\sim 10-50$ in the central occupation and $\\sim 10-70\\%$ in\nthe satellite occupation fraction}) is introduced in the reconstruction of\nquasar host halo mass distributions from the observed two-point-correlation\nfunction, if the HOD modeling does not account for the quenching effect in the\ncentral occupation function. While there is strong suppression of the\noccupation fraction of central quasars, the satellite occupation still follows\na power-law like behavior. Our results show that the global satellite fraction\nof quasars increases monotonically from high to low redshifts, with $20-40 \\%$\nof the quasars being satellite at intermediate redshifts, consistent with\nprevious clustering based estimates. In addition, our study reveals that while\nthe occupation function of quasars depends on redshift, luminosity, and\nfeedback modes, there is hardly any evolution in the supermassive black hole\n(SMBH; mass-selected sample) occupation. The SMBH HOD over the entire parameter\nspace is well-modeled by a power-law and a step function similar to what has\nbeen found for galaxies and low-luminosity active galactic nuclei."}

This captures the\nintegrated flux of a particular spectral line emission from multiple sources\nwithin a patch of the sky without resolving them. Mapping different galaxy line\nemissions, such as the HI $21$-cm and CO rotational lines via LIM, can reveal\ncomplementary information about the bias with which the line emitters trace the\nunderlying matter distribution and how different astrophysical phenomena affect\nthe clustering pattern of these signals. The stage where the structures in the\ncosmic web merge to form a single connected structure is known as the\npercolation transition. Using mock HI $21$-cm and CO($1-0$) LIM signals in the\npost-reionisation universe, we explore the connectivity of structures through\npercolation analysis and compare it with that of the underlying galaxy\ndistribution. We probe the relative contributions of voids, filaments, and\nsheets to the galaxy density and line intensity maps using a morphological\nmeasure known as the local dimension. The CO($1-0$) map exhibits an increased\nfilamentary behaviour and larger contribution from sheets than the $21$-cm map.\nWe attempt to explain such an emission of the CO($1-0$) line from biased\nenvironments. The upcoming SKA-Mid will produce tomographic intensity maps of\nthe $21$-cm signal at $z \\lesssim 3$ in Band-1. CO maps can be produced at\nthese redshifts in phase 2 of SKA-Mid, where the frequency coverage is expected\nto increase up to $\\sim 50$ GHz. We present forecasts for the recovery of the\nlocal dimensions of these intensity maps contaminated by instrumental noise,\nconsidering SKA-Mid observations."}
