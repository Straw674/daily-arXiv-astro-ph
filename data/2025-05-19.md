### [1] [commensurability: a Python package for classifying astronomical orbits based on their toroid volume](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10617)
*Subhadeep Sarkar,Michael S. Petersen*

**TL;DR**: 介绍了一个名为commensurability的Python包，用于通过基于镶嵌的算法识别满足轨道频率整数比的轨道族，并支持多种星系动力学库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 恒星围绕宿主星系中心运动的轨迹通常位于一个3D环面内，除非轨道频率呈现整数比（即频率可通约），否则轨道会遍历整个环面。现有的轨道分类方法（如频率分析）可能因频率不稳定或积分时间有限而影响分类结果的稳健性。

Data: 该研究使用星系动力学库（如AGAMA、gala和galpy）提供的相空间坐标数据。

Method: 研究采用基于镶嵌的算法（tessellation analysis）来识别满足频率可通约性的轨道族，通过测量轨道积分过程中遍历的环面体积进行分类。

Result: 开发的commensurability Python包能够更稳健地识别轨道族，支持多种星系动力学库，并提供了一个通用的镶嵌算法实现框架。

Abstract: As a star orbits the center of its host galaxy, the trajectory is encompassed
within a 3D toroid. The orbit probes all points in this toroid, unless its
orbital frequencies exhibit integer ratios (commensurate frequencies), in which
case a small sub-volume is traversed. commensurability is a Python package that
implements a tessellation-based algorithm for identifying orbital families that
satisfy commensurabilities by measuring the toroid volume traversed over orbit
integration. Compared to standard orbit classification methods such as
frequency analysis, tessellation analysis relies on configuration space
properties alone, making classification results more robust to frequency
instabilities or limited integration times. The package provides a framework
for analyzing phase-space coordinates using tessellation analysis, including a
subpackage for the implementation of the general tessellation algorithm. The
package is to be used with a galactic dynamics library; it currently supports
AGAMA, gala, and galpy.

### [2] [Redshift evolution of Lyman continuum escape fraction after JWST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10619)
*A. Ferrara,M. Giavalisco,L. Pentericci,E. Vanzella,A. Calabrò,M. Llerena*

**TL;DR**: 研究发现，星系中的LyC逃逸分数f_esc受星系外流强烈影响，并通过Attenuation-Free Model（AFM）解释了高红移星系的性质，预测f_esc随红移增加而上升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域关注星系LyC逃逸分数f_esc的机制及其随红移的变化，但缺乏对高红移星系中f_esc上升趋势的物理解释。

Data: 研究使用了特定数据子样本进行模型测试。

Method: 采用了Attenuation-Free Model（AFM）来模拟星系外流对f_esc的影响，并分析了星系特定恒星形成率（sSFR）的作用。

Result: 模型预测f_esc在红移0到20之间从0.007增长到0.6，与z=6.5以下的直接测量结果一致，并为高红移下UV星系光谱斜率β的下降趋势提供了物理解释。

Abstract: The LyC escape fraction from galaxies, $f_{\rm esc}$, is strongly boosted by
galactic outflows. In the Attenuation-Free Model (AFM) accounting for the
properties of $z>10$ galaxies, radiation-driven outflows develop once the
galaxy specific star formation rate, ${\rm sSFR} \ge {\rm sSFR}^* \approx 25\
{\rm Gyr}^{-1}$. As the cosmic sSFR increases with redshift, so does $f_{\rm
esc}(z)$, which, when globally averaged, grows from 0.007 to 0.6 in $0 < z <
20$. We successfully tested the model on specific data sub-samples. Our
predictions are consistent with direct measurements of $f_{\rm esc}$ up to
$z=6.5$, and provide a physical explanation for the observed decreasing trend
of the mean UV galaxy spectral slope, $\beta$, towards high-$z$.

**TL;DR**: 本研究利用JWST-NIRCam中波段测光技术，测量了宇宙正午时期星系的发射线流量，并研究了其尘埃和恒星形成特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域关注宇宙正午时期星系的尘埃和恒星形成特性，但现有研究在测量发射线流量和空间分辨分析方面存在局限性。

Data: 使用了MegaScience中波段巡天和UNCOVER深光谱巡天观测的14个红移1.3至2.4的星系样本。

Method: 通过中波段测光技术直接测量发射线流量，并与UNCOVER的光谱测量结果进行比较。

Result: 研究发现光度和光谱测量的发射线流量（Hα和Paβ）具有合理一致性，散射小于0.15 dex；测量了尘埃消光（平均A_V为1.4），并发现Hα和Paβ发射的空间偏移与尘埃分布相关。

Abstract: We demonstrate the power of JWST-NIRCam medium-band photometry to measure
emission line fluxes and study dust and star formation properties of galaxies
at cosmic noon. In this work, we present photometric emission line measurements
and spatially-resolved maps of H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$ for a sample of 14
galaxies at $1.3\leq z\leq 2.4$, observed by the MegaScience medium-band survey
and the UNCOVER deep spectroscopic survey. We measure line fluxes directly from
the medium-band photometry and compare with spectroscopic measurements from
UNCOVER. We find reasonable agreement between the photometric and spectroscopic
emission line fluxes for both H$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$, with scatter $<0.15$ dex
down to emission line equivalent widths of $10$\r{A}. We also make a nebular
dust measurement from the ratio Pa$\beta$ / H$\alpha$, finding an average
nebular A$_\mathrm{V}$ of 1.4. Our photometric A$_\mathrm{V}$ measurements show
a slightly larger scatter of $0.5$ magnitudes when compared to spectroscopic
measurements; however, this scatter may be partially caused by aperture
effects. Finally, we produce spatially resolved maps of H$\alpha$ emission,
Pa$\beta$ emission, and stellar continuum. We find that offsets in H$\alpha$
and Pa$\beta$ emission are common, especially for galaxies with the highest
A$_\mathrm{V}$, indicating dusty sub-structures. Furthermore, the correlation
between H$\alpha$ and continuum emission decreases with increasing
A$_\mathrm{V}$, suggesting that the dustiest objects have clumpy dust and star
formation distributions. Our study demonstrates the power of medium-band
photometry to directly probe emission line strengths, star formation, and dust
attenuation for hundreds of galaxies in UNCOVER and thousands of galaxies in
upcoming JWST medium-band surveys.

### [4] [Truncated star formation and ram pressure stripping in the Coma Cluster](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10633)
*Ariel O. Broderick,Ian D. Roberts,Michael J. Hudson*

**TL;DR**: 通过分析Coma星系团中45个星系的恒星形成率径向分布，研究发现星系团中的恒星形成率下降更快，表明冲压剥离在恒星形成抑制中起重要作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究背景聚焦于探索Coma星系团中恒星形成抑制的物理驱动因素，通过比较星系团内和场星系样本的恒星形成率分布。

Data: 使用了Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory调查中的45个星系数据，以及非星系团场星系作为对照样本。

Method: 测量了特定恒星形成率（sSFR）的径向分布，并应用了一个基于冲压剥离的慢速-快速抑制模型。

Result: 研究发现Coma星系团中的恒星形成率下降更陡峭，模型成功重现了场星系与Coma星系团星系之间的差异，表明冲压剥离在恒星形成抑制中起关键作用。

Abstract: We use 45 galaxies from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point
Observatory survey to study the physical drivers of star formation quenching in
the Coma cluster. We measure specific star formation rate (sSFR) radial
profiles for the Coma sample as well as a control sample of non-cluster field
galaxies. We find that compared to the control sample, galaxies within the Coma
Cluster have sSFR profiles that fall off more steeply with galactocentric
radius. We then apply a toy model based on slow-then-rapid quenching via ram
pressure stripping. We find that this model is able to reproduce the difference
in sSFR profiles between field and Coma galaxies. These results demonstrate
that ram pressure stripping plays a significant role in quenching star
formation in the nearest massive galaxy cluster.

### [5] [Origins of Carbon Dust in a JWST-Observed Primeval Galaxy at $z\sim$6.7](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10701)
*Ambra Nanni,Michael Romano,Darko Donevski,Joris Witstok,Irene Shivaei,Michel Fioc,Prasad Sawant*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过JWST观测的高红移星系JADES-GS-z6-0，揭示了其紫外光谱中的烃类尘埃特征，并探讨了早期宇宙中尘埃形成的两种可能途径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 高红移星系JADES-GS-z6-0的紫外光谱显示出烃类尘埃的显著特征，为研究早期宇宙中尘埃快速形成过程提供了理想案例。

Data: 使用詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜（JWST）的JADES项目观测数据，包括紫外光谱中的特征（如巴尔默减幅、紫外斜率和紫外凸起）。

Method: 通过模型模拟尘埃形成的多种途径，包括渐近巨星支（AGB）恒星和II型超新星的贡献，并结合恒星形成历史分析。

Result: 研究发现烃类尘埃（如PAHs）的形成有两种途径：ISM内高效尘埃吸积或主要由II型超新星产生，且PAHs不太可能仅来自AGB恒星或大颗粒碎裂。

Abstract: JADES-GS-z6-0, a high-redshift galaxy ($z \sim 6.7$) recently observed as
part of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic
Survey (JADES), exhibits a distinct bump in its rest-frame ultraviolet (UV)
spectrum indicative of a large quantity of hydrocarbon grains, a sign of rapid
metal and dust enrichment in its interstellar medium (ISM). This galaxy serves
as an ideal case for examining rapid dust formation processes in the early
universe.
  We investigated diverse dust production channels from a possible maximal
formation redshift of $z_{\rm form} \approx 17$, enabling dust contributions
from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars over the longest possible timescale.
Our model simultaneously reproduces key spectral features of JADES-GS-z6-0 such
as its Balmer decrement, UV slope, and UV bump. The match is obtained by
adopting a star-formation history in which a burst at $\sim 600$~Myr accounts
for approximately 30\% of the galaxy's final stellar mass.
  Our findings indicate two pathways for the formation of hydrocarbon grains,
such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs): (1) efficient dust accretion
within the ISM, necessitating a low depletion of metals into dust grains from
Type II supernovae ($\approx 10$\%), or (2) dust production predominantly by
Type II supernovae, requiring a high depletion fraction ($\approx 73$\%)
without dust accretion. We further demonstrate that PAHs are unlikely to
originate solely from AGB stars or from shattering of large grains in the ISM.
The evolution of the UV slope with redshift points to a complex and bursty star
formation history for galaxies observed by JADES.

*S. Grimozzi,M. E. De Rossi,A. S. Font*

**TL;DR**: 通过分析ARTEMIS模拟中与银河系类似星系相关的矮星系的冷气体化学成分，研究发现被瓦解的矮星系比存活的矮星系具有更低的气相金属丰度和更高的α元素丰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 银河系（MW）周围存在两类矮星系：一类是过去已完全与银河系合并的被瓦解矮星系，另一类是当前仍围绕银河系运行的存活矮星系。

Data: 使用了ARTEMIS模拟中与银河系类似星系相关的矮星系的冷气体化学组成数据。

Method: 分析了ARTEMIS模拟中两类矮星系的冷气体化学成分。

Result: 研究发现，在相同恒星质量下，被瓦解的矮星系比存活的矮星系具有更低的气相金属丰度和更高的α元素丰度；此外，被瓦解的矮星系若吸积时间更早且恒星形成气体比例更高，其金属丰度更低而[Mg/Fe]更高，存活矮星系的气相金属丰度和[Mg/Fe]也表现出类似趋势。

Abstract: Two populations of dwarf galaxies can be associated with the Milky Way (MW):
the disrupted dwarfs that fully merged with it in the past and the surviving
satellites that orbit around it in the present time. In this work, we analyzed
the chemical composition of the cold gas in both populations of dwarfs
associated with MW like galaxies in the ARTEMIS simulations. We found that, at
fixed stellar mass, disrupted dwarfs have lower gas phase metallicity and are
more alpha-enhanced than surviving dwarfs. We also noticed that disrupted
satellites accreted earlier and with higher SF gas fractions had lower
metallicity and higher [Mg/Fe] at fixed mass. In the case of surviving dwarfs,
we obtained a similar trend for both gas-phase metallicity and [Mg/Fe]
abundance.

Abstract: Sub-parsec (sub-pc) binary supermassive black holes (BSBHs) should be common
from galaxy mergers, yet direct evidence has been elusive. We present
HST/WFC3IR F160W imaging for a sample of 8 candidate sub-pc BSBHs at redshifts
z~0.1--0.5, as well as cross-comparison with a sample of ordinary quasars with
archival HST/WFC3 IR F160W images. These 8 candidate sub-pc BSBHs were
identified from multi-epoch spectroscopic surveys of quasars (including both
typical quasars and those with single-peaked velocity-offset broad lines).
whose broad H$\beta$ lines are significantly offset (by ~< a few hundred km/s)
from the systemic redshifts. We directly test the prediction that the host
galaxies of BSBHs would have a higher fraction of disturbed morphologies and
younger stellar bulges from recent interactions than those of control quasars.
After careful subtraction of the central quasar light, our candidate BSBH hosts
show a statistically undifferentiated distribution of host asymmetry,
indicative of a similar fraction of recent mergers. While a significantly
larger sample is needed to place this result on a much firmer statistical
ground, it opens questions as to the timescale differences between galaxy
merger and BSBH formation, or the efficacy of the radial-velocity-shift--based
selection of sub-pc BSBH candidates.

*Zhimin Zhou,Wenwen Wang*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过分析星系结构、恒星形成和HI气体含量的关系，揭示了星系形态在演化中的作用，发现恒星形成星系以盘为主，而静止星系以核球为主。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 为了探究星系形态在演化中的作用，研究分析了星系结构、恒星形成和HI气体含量之间的关系。

Data: 使用了DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys的多波段图像和xGASS的本地星系样本数据。

Method: 通过详细的结构分解，研究了结构成分和颜色特性与恒星形成主序偏离（ΔSFR_MS）和HI气体缺乏（Δf_HI）的关系。

Result: 发现核球比例随ΔSFR_MS增加和恒星质量降低而减少，恒星形成星系以盘为主，静止星系以核球为主；颜色梯度与ΔSFR_MS的关系随恒星质量和区域不同而变化，HI气体与盘主导的恒星形成系统更密切相关。

Abstract: To investigate the role of morphology in galaxy evolution, we analyze the
relationships between galaxy structure, star formation, and HI gas content.
Using multi-band images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, we perform
detailed structural decompositions on a representative local galaxy sample from
xGASS. Structural components and color properties are examined as functions of
deviations from the star formation main sequence ($\rm \Delta SFR_{MS}$) and HI
gas deficiency ($\rm \Delta f_{HI}$). We find that bulge fractions decrease
with higher $\rm \Delta SFR_{MS}$ and lower stellar mass, indicating that
star-forming galaxies are predominantly disc-dominated, while quiescent
galaxies are bulge-dominated. The slope of the color ($g-r$) versus $\rm \Delta
SFR_{MS}$ relationship decreases from low to high stellar masses and from outer
to inner regions, with greater color variation in massive galaxies. Color
gradients are predominantly negative, becoming shallower in lower-mass galaxies
and in the outer disk regions. We also identify inflection points in the color
gradient and bulge fraction relations with $\rm \Delta SFR_{MS}$, with
main-sequence galaxies having the lowest bulge fractions and steepest color
gradients. At fixed stellar mass, we observe only a slight correlation between
bulge fraction and HI deficiency. However, outer disk colors show a stronger
dependence on HI content than inner regions, and color gradients flatten as
$\rm \Delta f_{HI}$ increases. These results suggest that HI gas is more
closely linked to star-forming, disc-dominated systems, supporting the idea
that gas accretion fuels star formation primarily in galaxy disks.

Result: 研究发现旋臂和旋臂间区域的分子云寿命和反馈时间尺度分布相似，表明旋臂不太可能在触发恒星形成中起主导作用；而恒星形成效率在旋臂间区域略高于旋臂。

Abstract: The matter cycle between gas clouds and stars in galaxies plays a crucial
role in regulating galaxy evolution through feedback mechanisms. In turn, the
local and global galactic environments shape the interstellar medium and
provide the initial conditions for star formation, potentially affecting the
properties of this small-scale matter cycle. In particular, spiral arms have
been proposed to play a pivotal role in the star formation life cycle, by
enhancing the gas density and triggering star formation. However, their exact
role is still debated. In this paper, we investigate the role of spiral arms in
the giant molecular cloud evolutionary life cycle and on the star formation
process in a sample of 22 nearby spiral galaxies from the PHANGS survey. We
measure the cloud lifetime, the feedback timescale, the typical distance
between independent regions and the star formation efficiency in spiral arms
and inter-arm regions separately. We find that the distributions of the cloud
lifetime as well as the feedback timescale are similar in both environments.
This result suggests that spiral arms are unlikely to play a dominant role in
triggering star formation. By contrast, the star formation efficiency appears
to be slightly higher in inter-arm regions compared to spiral arms.

Abstract: Markarian 231 (Mrk 231) is one of the brightest ultraluminous infrared
galaxies (ULIRGs) known to date. It displays a unique optical-UV spectrum,
characterized by a strong and perplexing attenuation in the near-UV, associated
with a sudden polarization peak. Building on previous spectro-photometric
modeling, we investigated the hypothesis that the core of Mrk 231 may host a
binary SMBH system. In this scenario, the accretion disk of the primary, more
massive SMBH is responsible for the optical-UV spectrum. The disk of the
secondary, less massive SMBH, would be expected to essentially emit in the far
UV. We applied this model to archival photometric and polarimetric data of Mrk
231 and tried to obtain the best fit possible. To support our findings, we
performed radiative transfer calculations to determine the spatial disposition
of each main component constituting Mrk 231. We find that a binary SMBH model
can reproduce both the observed flux and polarization of Mrk 231 remarkably
well. We infer that the core potentially hosts a binary SMBH system, with a
primary SMBH of about 1.6x10^8 solar masses and a secondary of about 1.1x10^7
solar masses , separated by a semimajor axis of 146 AU.The secondary SMBH
drives a degree of polarization of 3 % between 0.1 and 0.2 {\mu}m, with a
corresponding polarization position angle of about 134{\deg} , which is
consistent with scattering within an accretion disk. The primary SMBH and the
structure around it are responsible for a degree of polarization of 23 %
between 0.3 and 0.4 {\mu}m with a corresponding polarization position angle of
about 96{\deg} , that is possibly attributed to scattering within the quasar's
wind. Finally, our model predicts the existence of a second peak in polarized
flux in the far-ultraviolet, a telltale signature that could definitively prove
the presence of a binary SMBH.

*En Chen,Xi Chen,Min Fang,Xuepeng Chen,Qianru He,Tian Yang*

**TL;DR**: 研究发现双气泡系统N65和N65bis的形成可能是由子弹星云的云-云碰撞引起的，并揭示了碰撞触发了恒星形成的过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 双气泡系统N65和N65bis的形成机制尚不明确，但云-云碰撞（CCC）可能是其起源的关键因素。

Data: 研究使用了蓝移和红移的13CO气体成分数据，分别与双气泡系统和子弹星云相关联。

Method: 通过分析云-云碰撞的特征（如桥特征、U形空腔和位移互补分布）以及估算碰撞时间尺度，结合年轻恒星对象（YSOs）的分布来验证假设。

Result: 研究发现云-云碰撞的时间尺度为1.15到2.0 Myr，与双气泡系统中两个HII区域的动力学年龄一致，并揭示了碰撞路径上恒星形成的触发机制。

Abstract: We report that the formation of the twin-bubble system N65 and N65bis may be
caused by the cloud-cloud collision (CCC) from the Bullet Nebula. The
blue-shifted $^{13}$CO gas component (N65a [47, 55] km s$^{-1}$) is associated
with the twin-bubble system, while the red-shifted $^{13}$CO gas component
(N65b [55, 62] km s$^{-1}$) is linked to the Bullet Nebula. The distinct
signatures of CCC, such as the bridge feature, the U-shape cavity and the
complementary distribution with displacement, are found between N65a and N65b.
The collision timescale is estimated to be 1.15 to 2.0 Myr, which is consistent
with the dynamical ages of the two \HII regions in N65a (0.73 Myr for N65bis
and 1.19 Myr for N65, respectively), indicating their CCC-related origin. A
total of 354 young stellar objects (YSOs) are founded, which are clustered into
eight MST (Minimum Spinning Tree) groups. The distribution of M1 (at the
post-frontal edge) and M2, M3, M4 (at the pre-frontal edge) suggests that the
CCC triggers star formation along the collision path of $b=0^{\circ}.35$, with
younger YSOs present at the pre-frontal edge. Therefore, the bipolar morphology
of the twin-bubble system can be interpreted by the collision of N65a and N65b
along $b=0^{\circ}.35$ about 2 Myr ago.

**TL;DR**: 本研究评估了三种神经网络（自编码器、卷积神经网络和U-Net）在预测类星体和星系光谱连续谱中的性能，发现自编码器在类星体数据上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 随着大型光谱巡天项目的进行，观测到的类星体光谱数量急剧增加，需要开发快速且准确的自动化方法来估计光谱连续谱。

Data: 研究使用了WEAVE巡天的模拟类星体光谱数据，以及来自DESI和VIPERS巡天的真实观测数据。

Method: 研究评估了自编码器、卷积神经网络（CNN）和U-Net三种神经网络架构的性能，使用绝对分数通量误差（AFFE）作为评价指标。

Result: 自编码器在类星体数据上表现最佳，中位AFFE为0.009，并能有效恢复DESI类星体光谱中的Lyα光学深度演化；同样的架构在星系数据上也表现良好，中位AFFE为0.014，并能重现D4000n断裂特征。

Abstract: Context. Ongoing and upcoming large spectroscopic surveys are drastically
increasing the number of observed quasar spectra, requiring the development of
fast and accurate automated methods to estimate spectral continua. Aims. This
study evaluates the performance of three neural networks (NN) - an autoencoder,
a convolutional NN (CNN), and a U-Net - in predicting quasar continua within
the rest-frame wavelength range of $1020~\text{\AA}$ to $2000~\text{\AA}$. The
ability to generalize and predict galaxy continua within the range of
$3500~\text{\AA}$ to $5500~\text{\AA}$ is also tested. Methods. The performance
of these architectures is evaluated using the absolute fractional flux error
(AFFE) on a library of mock quasar spectra for the WEAVE survey, and on real
data from the Early Data Release observations of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI) and the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS).
Results. The autoencoder outperforms the U-Net, achieving a median AFFE of
0.009 for quasars. The best model also effectively recovers the Ly$\alpha$
optical depth evolution in DESI quasar spectra. With minimal optimization, the
same architectures can be generalized to the galaxy case, with the autoencoder
reaching a median AFFE of 0.014 and reproducing the D4000n break in DESI and
VIPERS galaxies.

Abstract: The potential of galaxies to host habitable planets is central to
astrobiology, tightly linked to galaxy-scale evolution and cosmological
processes. Using IllustrisTNG, we revisit the proposed local peak in the
mass-metallicity relation for small, metal-rich, star-forming galaxies
(Cloudlet) as an indicator of enhanced galactic habitability. We refine the
earlier analysis by applying updated filtering criteria to identify a more
refined sample, further selecting objects based on their history. This process
resulted in a confirmed sample of 97 dwarf galaxies, alongside 519 additional
structures of uncertain origin, potentially comprising both numerical artefacts
and unrecognised physical systems. Under these stricter conditions, the
proposed bimodality in galactic habitability is strongly diminished. However,
the astrobiological potential of metal-rich dwarfs, most of which are compact
remnants of more massive galaxies that underwent tidal stripping, is a
thrilling area of exploration. Although dense stellar environments are
traditionally seen as inhospitable, recent studies highlight the role of
dynamic environments in enhancing the distribution of biological material.
Furthermore, the potential habitability of tidal structures formed in the
aftermath of galactic interactions is a fascinating possibility. Our findings
suggest that non-traditional structures support conditions favourable for life,
opening up exciting new avenues for astrobiological research. This research
underscores the need for a holistic approach to studying habitability that
moves beyond planetary and stellar-focused frameworks to incorporate the
broader galactic environment. Understanding the interactions between galaxies,
their evolution, and the influence of their surroundings is essential to
developing a more comprehensive model of how and where life might emerge and
persist across the Universe.

Abstract: We performed a search for new dwarf galaxies in a direction towards the
southwestern part of the Local Void using the data on DESI Legacy Imaging
Surveys. In a sky area of $\sim1000$ square degrees, we discovered 12
candidates to nearby dwarfs with a high confidence. Four of them are probable
new companions to the nearby galaxy M\,83 and others are isolated objects. We
found also 20 nearby dwarf candidates with a low confidence. Almost all of the
detected galaxies are classified as late type dwarfs. A new cluster of bluish
stars with an angular diameter of 0.9$^{\prime}$ is revealed by us at a high
galactic latitude, $b = 29^{\circ}$. Being at a distance of $\sim70$ kpc, it
can be a globular cluster associated with the Milky Way stellar stream
Sagittarius dSph or a new ultra-faint satellite of the Milky Way.

Abstract: The PRIMAger instrument on board the proposed PRIMA satellite will offer the
unprecedented capability to obtain hundreds of square-degree maps in polarised
emission at sub-arcminute resolution in four Far-IR bands. This will open a
unique window to study magnetic fields in our Galaxy. PRIMAGAL, a proposed
survey of polarized dust emission in the Milky Way Galactic Plane will
determine the strength and orientation of magnetic fields towards several
thousands of filamentary clouds in a wide range of linear masses, column
densities, evolution, star-formation rates and efficiencies, and Galactic
environment. This survey will address for the first time in a statistically
significant fashion the role that magnetic fields play in shaping the
formation, evolution and fragmentation of dense ISM filaments down to a minimum
scale of 0.4 pc up to 8 kpc distance from the Sun. A 4-band polarization survey
of the Galactic Plane with |b|<1{\deg} (a total of 720 sq. deg.) can be
executed by PRIMAger in about 1200 hours including all mapping and instrument
overhead.

**TL;DR**: JWST发现了一个极早期（红移z=14.44）的明亮星系MoM-z14，其亮度和数量密度远超预期，揭示了宇宙早期恒星形成的快速演化及其与局部星团的潜在联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: JWST揭示了在红移z>10的极早期宇宙中存在大量明亮星系，这与之前的预期不符。MoM-z14是目前发现的最远星系之一，其观测数据扩展了我们对宇宙早期演化的认识。

Data: 研究使用了JWST的NIRSpec/prism光谱数据，通过Lyman-α断裂和五个紫外发射线的检测确认了红移z=14.44。

Method: 通过光谱分析确认红移，并利用紫外发射线的高等效宽度（EWs）和紫外斜率（β=-2.5）推断恒星形成历史和尘埃衰减情况。

Result: MoM-z14的亮度和数量密度远超预期，表明宇宙早期恒星形成速率快速上升；其紧凑的尺寸和部分电离的周围环境挑战了现有再电离模型；氮丰度模式与局部球状星团相似，可能揭示了早期恒星形成的机制。

Abstract: JWST has revealed a stunning population of bright galaxies at surprisingly
early epochs, $z>10$, where few such sources were expected. Here we present the
most distant example of this class yet -- MoM-z14, a luminous
($M_{\rm{UV}}=-20.2$) source in the COSMOS legacy field at
$z_{\rm{spec}}=14.44^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ that expands the observational frontier
to a mere 280 million years after the Big Bang. The redshift is confirmed with
NIRSpec/prism spectroscopy through a sharp Lyman-$\alpha$ break and
$\approx3\sigma$ detections of five rest-UV emission lines. The number density
of bright $z_{\rm{spec}}\approx14-15$ sources implied by our "Mirage or
Miracle" survey spanning $\approx350$ arcmin$^{2}$ is $>100\times$ larger
($182^{+329}_{-105}\times$) than pre-JWST consensus models. The high EWs of UV
lines (${\approx}15{-}35$ \AA) signal a rising star-formation history, with a
${\approx}10\times$ increase in the last 5 Myr
($\rm{SFR_{\rm{5Myr}}}/\rm{SFR_{\rm{50Myr}}}=9.9^{+3.0}_{-5.8}$). The source is
extremely compact (circularized $r_{\rm{e}} = 74^{+15}_{-12}$ pc), and yet
resolved, suggesting an AGN is not the dominant source of light. The steep UV
slope ($\beta=-2.5^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$) implies negligible dust attenuation and a
young stellar population. The absence of a strong damping wing may indicate
that the immediate surroundings of MoM-z14 are partially ionized at a redshift
where virtually every reionization model predicts a $\approx100\%$ neutral
fraction. The nitrogen emission and highly super-solar [N/C]$>1$ hint at an
abundance pattern similar to local globular clusters that may have once hosted
luminous supermassive stars. Since this abundance pattern is also common among
the most ancient stars born in the Milky Way, we may be directly witnessing the
formation of such stars in dense clusters, connecting galaxy evolution across
the entire sweep of cosmic time.

Background: NGC 4147是一个具有强潮汐尾的银河系球状星团，近期模拟预测无潮汐尾的球状星团在大距离处会出现上升的速度弥散剖面，本研究旨在通过观测验证这一预测。

Data: 使用了GEMINI@GMOS光谱仪在红外CaII三重线区域对NGC 4147潮汐尾起始处的恒星进行观测，并测量了它们的径向速度和整体金属丰度。同时结合了文献中已有的星团成员径向速度数据。

Method: 通过分析恒星的光谱数据，测量径向速度和金属丰度，筛选出9颗高置信度的星团候选恒星，构建了星团的速度弥散剖面。

Result: 研究发现NGC 4147的速度弥散剖面在大距离处呈现平坦或略微上升的趋势，与近期模拟的预测不符，但最外层恒星的平均速度弥散支持NGC 4147可能起源于一个具有核心暗物质分布的矮星系。

Abstract: We report results on the radial velocity dispersion profile built out to the
outskirts of NGC 4147, a Milky Way globular cluster with detected strong tidal
tails. The cluster was chosen to probe, from an observational point of view,
recent simulations that suggest that rising velocity dispersion profiles at
large distance from the clusters' centers would be seen in globular clusters
without tidal tails. From GEMINI@GMOS spectra, centered in the infrared CaII
triplet region, of selected stars located along the onset of NGC 4147's tidal
tails, we measured their radial velocities and overall metallicities. The
derived metallicities were used to ultimately assessing on the highly-ranked
cluster candidates of 9 stars, located between ~ 7 and 33 pc from the cluster's
center, suitable for testing the aforementioned simulations. We complemented
the present radial velocities with others available in the literature for
cluster's members, and built a cluster velocity dispersion profile which
suggests a mostly flat or slightly rising profile at large distances from the
cluster's center. This outcome confirms that kinematically hot outermost
cluster's stars are seen in NGC 4147, which disproves the recent model
predictions. Nevertheless, the mean velocity dispersion of the outermost
cluster's stars agrees with NGC 4147 being formed in a 10^8-10^9Mo dwarf galaxy
with a cored dark matter profile that later was accreted on to the Milky Way.

**TL;DR**: 本研究利用统计方法估计红移，表征了恒星形成星系（SFGs）和活动星系核（AGN）的射电光度函数（RLFs），填补了缺乏光谱数据的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 在缺乏全面光谱数据的情况下，大面积的灵敏射电巡天探测到许多光学和红外对应体较暗的源，这些源的红移和光谱信息缺失，这给理解射电源的群体带来了挑战。统计工具常被用来模拟参数（如红移）以替代观测数据。

Data: 使用了GAMA G23和EMU早期科学观测的数据。

Method: 采用简单的统计技术估计红移，以测量G23射电源整体的RLFs，并分别对SFGs和AGN进行分类和红移估计。

Result: 计算得到的RLFs与现有研究匹配良好，特别是在低红移星系中；对于高红移射电源，采用更真实的高红移分布模型后，RLFs也与实测结果吻合良好。

Abstract: This study characterises the radio luminosity functions (RLFs) for SFGs and
AGN using statistical redshift estimation in the absence of comprehensive
spectroscopic data. Sensitive radio surveys over large areas detect many
sources with faint optical and infrared counterparts, for which redshifts and
spectra are unavailable. This challenges our attempt to understand the
population of radio sources. Statistical tools are often used to model
parameters (such as redshift) as an alternative to observational data. Using
the data from GAMA G23 and EMU early science observations, we explore simple
statistical techniques to estimate the redshifts in order to measure the RLFs
of the G23 radio sources as a whole and for SFGs and AGN separately. Redshifts
and AGN/SFG classifications are assigned statistically for those radio sources
without spectroscopic data. The calculated RLFs are compared with existing
studies, and the results suggest that the RLFs match remarkably well for low
redshift galaxies with an optical counterpart. We use a more realistic high
redshift distribution to model the redshifts of (most likely) high redshift
radio sources and find that the LFs from our approach match well with measured
LFs. We also look at strategies to compare the RLFs of radio sources without an
optical counterpart to existing studies.

Method: 方法包括拉格朗日描述符的计算、轨道集合的前向和后向时间演化模拟，以及构建起源-命运图。

Result: 结果表明稳定（不稳定）流形主要影响模型在未来（过去）的轨道特性。

Abstract: We numerically investigate the orbital dynamics of a two-dimensional galactic
model, emphasizing the influence of stable and unstable manifolds on the
evolution of orbits. In our analysis we use evaluations of the system's
Lagrangian descriptors to reveal the structure and location of manifolds. In
addition, we perform extensive computations of the forward and backward in time
evolution of ensembles of orbits, which allow us to study the future and past
dynamics of the model by constructing its so-called origin-fate maps. Focusing
on the properties of the escape of orbits from the central regions of the
model's configuration space, we analyze various aspects of the orbits'
evolutions, like the time an orbit needs to escape from the central region, the
total time it spends at the exterior areas of the galaxy, as well as the number
of its escapes and reentries from and to the central region. Furthermore, we
follow the past and future evolution of orbits keeping track of the regions
from which they leave the central parts of the galaxy, and relate different
orbital behaviors with the enhancement of specific morphological features in
the system's configuration space. Our results indicate that the stable
(unstable) manifolds mainly influence the orbital characteristics of the model
in the future (past).

Result: 研究表明，类似"巨型弧"的大型结构在统计均匀的宇宙中普遍存在，反驳了其对标准宇宙学模型的挑战。

Abstract: The so-called "Giant Arc" is a sparse pattern of MgII absorbers spanning
approximately 740 comoving Mpc, whose discovery has been claimed to contradict
the large-scale homogeneity inherent to the standard cosmological model. We
previously showed that, with the same algorithm and parameters used for its
discovery, very similar patterns are abundant in uniform random distributions,
and among equivalent halo samples in a cosmological simulation of the standard
model. In a response, the original discoverers of the "Giant Arc" have argued
that these parameters were only appropriate for their specific observational
data, but that a smaller linking length should be used for control studies, in
which case far fewer patterns are detected. We briefly review and disprove
these arguments, and demonstrate that large patterns like the "Giant Arc" are
indeed ubiquitous in a statistically homogeneous universe.

fulfilling the mission science requirements while maximizing general

**TL;DR**: 该研究探讨了超大质量黑洞附近恒星因潮汐加热导致的轨道和结构演化，发现稳定的质量转移率由潮汐加热时间尺度决定，可能产生低光度活动星系核。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 超大质量黑洞（SMBHs）附近的恒星结构可能因潮汐加热发生显著改变，潮汐加热的能量可能远超恒星结合能。目前对恒星与SMBHs相互作用的研究尚不充分，尤其是质量转移的稳定性及其对活动星系核的影响。

Data: 研究使用了MESA模拟和解析模型来分析恒星结构演化和轨道动力学。

Method: 结合潮汐加热、恒星结构演化、引力波和潮汐导致的轨道衰减以及洛希瓣溢流引起的质量转移的耦合动力学进行研究。

Result: 研究发现稳定的质量转移率由潮汐加热时间尺度决定，可能产生低光度活动星系核；质量转移的稳定性与潮汐能量在恒星内部的耗散位置有关，且可能产生部分潮汐撕裂事件和准周期性爆发。

Abstract: The structure of stars orbiting close to supermassive black holes (SMBHs) can
be dramatically modified by tidal heating, which can in principle dissipate an
energy much larger than the stellar binding energy. We use analytic models and
MESA to explore the coupled dynamics of tidal heating, stellar structural
evolution, orbital decay due to gravitational waves and tides, and mass
transfer due to Roche lobe overflow. In contrast to more equal mass stellar
binaries, the stable mass transfer rate for stars orbiting SMBHs is typically
set by the tidal heating timescale (the timescale for tides to increase the
stellar radius), not by the gravitational wave orbital decay timescale. The
resulting stable mass transfer rate is sensitive to the tidal heating model but
is plausibly $\sim 10^{-3}-10^{-5} M_\odot {\, \rm yr^{-1}}$ (and perhaps
larger), sufficient to produce low-luminosity active galactic nuclei in many
galaxies. The stability of mass transfer is sensitive to where in the stellar
interior the tidal energy is dissipated. MESA models confirm the expected
result that mass transfer is unstable (stable) if tidal heating increases
(decreases) the fraction of the star that is convective. More detailed
conclusions about the stability of mass-transfer will require self-consistently
calculating how the tidal heating of stars changes in response to internal
structural changes produced by the tidal heating itself. Stars with tidal
heating-induced mass transfer can produce a large population of low-luminosity
active galactic nuclei; they may also be the progenitors of some partial tidal
disruption candidates (e.g., ASASSN-14ko) as well as short period
quasi-periodic eruptions (e.g., eRO-QPE2 and GSN 069). However, many repeating
nuclear transients produced by tidal heating-induced mass loss are likely
fainter than those detected thus far, and remain to be discovered.

**TL;DR**: 研究通过分析65个孤立毫秒脉冲星的横向速度和银河高度，推导出其系统反冲速度分布，并验证了其在球状星团中的保留比例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 毫秒脉冲星（MSPs）的系统反冲速度分布对于理解其形成机制和估算其在星团中的保留比例至关重要，但目前缺乏径向速度测量数据。

Data: 使用了65个孤立或场毫秒脉冲星系统的天体测量数据，计算了它们的横向速度和银河高度。

Method: 通过假设横向速度分量随时间稳定且系统反冲速度方向均匀分布，推导出系统反冲速度的分布模型，并进行了动力学群体合成分析。

Result: 研究发现系统反冲速度分布可由三个麦克斯韦分量的线性组合近似，验证了假设的合理性，并估算出孤立MSP系统的初始和当前银河尺度高度分别为0.32 kpc和0.66 kpc，约13%的MSPs能在球状星团中保留。

Abstract: The systemic recoil velocity ($v_\mathrm{sys}$) distribution of millisecond
pulsars (MSPs) is essential for understanding the MSP formation and estimating
the retention fractions of MSPs in star clusters, which can potentially be
determined with astrometric studies that take into account MSPs' long-term
dynamic evolution and the scarcity of radial velocity measurements. We compiled
65 isolated (or field) MSP systems (including lone MSPs) that are well
astrometrically determined, and calculated their transverse peculiar (or space)
velocities $\boldsymbol{v}_\perp$ and Galactic heights $z$. We find that the
observed Galactic-longitude components $v_\mathrm{l}$ of $\boldsymbol{v}_\perp$
can be well described by a linear combination of three normal distributions.
Assuming that 1) $v_\mathrm{l}$ are statistically stable over time (the
"stable-$v_\mathrm{l}$" assumption), and 2) $\boldsymbol{v}_\mathrm{sys}$
directions are uniformly distributed (the
"isotropic-$\boldsymbol{v}_\mathrm{sys}$" assumption), the MSP $v_\mathrm{sys}$
distribution can be approximated by a linear combination of three Maxwellian
components. Our dynamical population synthesis analysis based on the derived
$v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution verified the "stable-$v_\mathrm{l}$" assumption
in the parameter space of this work, and estimated the initial and the current
Galaxy-wide scale heights of isolated MSP systems to be about 0.32 kpc and 0.66
kpc, respectively. According to the MSP $v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution,
$\sim13$% of all the MSPs born in a globular cluster (GC) with the nominal 50
$\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ central escape velocity can be retained. Therefore, the
$v_\mathrm{sys}$ distribution of isolated MSP systems may account for the high
number of MSPs discovered in GCs, which implies that MSPs in star clusters may
follow the same formation channel(s) as isolated MSP systems.

Abstract: Determining how much mass is removed by stellar winds is crucial to
understanding massive star evolution and feedback. However, traditional
spectroscopic diagnostics in the UV and optical are not sensitive enough to
characterize weak stellar winds of OB stars in low-metallicity environments. A
new tool to access weak stellar winds is provided by spectroscopy in the
infrared (IR). Stellar atmosphere models indicate that the hydrogen Br$\alpha$
line at $\lambda$\,4.05\,$\mu$m is a useful mass-loss rate indicator,
particularly at low metallicity. The unprecedented capabilities of the NIRSpec
spectrograph on board of the \emph{James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) allow us
to measure this line in spectra of massive stars in other galaxies. In this
work, we present the first NIRSpec spectra of O-type stars in the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC), which has a metallicity of only 20\% Solar. Our sample
consists of thirteen stars with spectral types ranging from O2 to O9.5
including supergiants, giants, and dwarfs. The stars belong to NGC\,346, the
most massive young cluster in the SMC. We describe the observing strategy and
data reduction, highlighting the treatment of the nebular background emission.
The spectra cover the 2.8--5.1 $\mu$m wavelength range, and we detect the
Br$\alpha$ line in emission in each of our sample stars. Using a combination of
spectral and photometric data ranging from the UV to the IR, we improve the
measurements of stellar luminosity and reddening. A first qualitative
comparison of the observed Br$\alpha$ line with stellar atmosphere models shows
its potential as a wind diagnostic for weak-winded stars.

\rm{[Fe/H]} \leq 0.4$ and ages from a few hundred Myr to $\sim 14$ Gyr. Age
information for this sample is available from stellar seismology, which is
essential for studying the radioactive element Th. We derive Th and Eu
abundances through $\chi^2$ fitting of high-resolution archival spectra ($R
\sim 80,000$) observed with the High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) at the
Subaru Telescope. We create synthetic spectra for individual stars using a 1D
LTE spectral synthesis code, Turbospectrum, adopting MARCS model atmospheres.
Our study establishes the use of a less extensively studied Th II line at 5989
angstrom, carefully taking into account the blends of other spectral lines to
derive the Th abundance. We successfully determine Eu abundance for 89 stars in
our sample and Th for 81 stars. For the remaining 8 stars, we estimate the
upper limits of Th abundance. After correcting the Th abundance for the decay,
we find no correlation between $\rm{[Th/Eu]}$ and $\rm{[Fe/H]}$, which
indicates that actinides production with respect to lanthanides does not depend
on metallicity. On the other hand, we find a positive correlation of
$\rm{[Th/Eu]}$ with age, with a slope of $0.10 \pm 0.04$. This may hint at the
possibility that the dominant r-process sources are different between the early
and late universe.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 化学建模和合成观测是解释观测数据的强大方法，但需要了解物理条件。

Data: 本文使用了I类原恒星系统中的化学丰度数据，包括CO、CN、CS、H2CO和CH3OH的分子发射数据。

Method: APE代码结合了原恒星演化的物理模型（包括中心天体、包层、原行星盘和外流），并提供了化学模拟、辐射传输计算和合成干涉成像的接口。

Result: APE生成了原恒星系统的密度和温度图，并展示了CO、CS和H2CO的X形发射特征，与I类源IRAS 04302+2247的观测结果相似。

Abstract: Chemical modeling and synthetic observations are powerful methods to
interpret observations, both requiring a knowledge of the physical conditions.
In this paper, we present the Analytical Protostellar Environment (APE) code,
which aims at making chemical simulations and synthetic observations
accessible. APE contains a physical model of protostellar evolution (including
the central object, the envelope, the protoplanetary disk and the outflow) as
well as interfaces to publicly available codes to perform chemical simulations,
radiative transfer calculations, and synthetic interferometry imaging. APE
produces density and temperature maps of protostellar systems. The code can
also follow individual particles throughout their journey in a collapsing core.
APE includes a treatment of the dust grain size-distribution to compute
opacities self-consistently for subsequent radiative transfer. We show an
example of application of APE by computing chemical abundance maps of CO, CN,
CS, H2CO, and CH3OH in a Class I protostellar system. We also performed
synthetic ALMA observations of their molecular emission assuming an edge-on
source inclination. The moment 0 maps of CO, CS, and H2CO display an X-shaped
emission similar to what is observed toward the Class I source IRAS 04302+2247.

*Lynne A. Hillenbrand,Adolfo S. Carvalho,Dan Stern,Michael Connelley,Facundo Pérez Paolino,Ahaan Shetty,Zachariah Milby,Howard Isaacson*

**TL;DR**: 本文报道了2019年开始并于2021年初达到峰值的一颗新发现的FU Ori型爆发事件，研究对象为年轻恒星WISE J054452.25+333009.6，其光学和中红外波段亮度显著增加，并通过光谱分析确认其符合FU Ori类特征。

Background: FU Ori型爆发是年轻恒星的一种剧烈活动现象，本文研究的WISE J054452.25+333009.6在光学和中红外波段亮度显著增加，为理解此类爆发事件提供了新的观测数据。

Method: 通过高分辨率光谱分析和纯吸积盘模型拟合，确定了爆发源的光谱特征和物理参数。

Result: 研究结果显示，爆发源的光谱特征与FU Ori类一致，吸积盘模型拟合得出吸积率、恒星质量、内盘半径等参数，并计算了吸积光度和最大盘温。

Abstract: We present a newly appreciated FU Ori outburst event that began in 2019 and
reached a peak in early 2021. Suspected young stellar object WISE
J054452.25+333009.6 experienced substantial brightening, in excess of $-5$ mag
at optical wavelengths and $-2.5$ mag at mid-infrared wavelengths. The time
from near-quiescence to peak brightness was approximately 24 months. Optical
and near-infrared spectra confirm that the outbursting source (hereby
designated FUOr-Aur 0544+3330) shows all the hallmarks of the FU Ori class,
including the Li I indicator of stellar youth. The mix of ionized and neutral
atomic lines, alongside prominent molecular absorption features, is consistent
with the expected change in spectral type from earlier in the optical to
later-type in the near-infrared. The closest analog among well-studied FU Ori
objects is V1515 Cyg. Both sources have unusually narrow-lined absorption
spectra that can be explained by a face-on disk orientation, such that
disk-broadening is minimized and wind-induced blueshift (in e.g. H$\alpha$,
NaD, Ca II) is maximized. Both the optical through infrared spectral energy
distribution and high-resolution spectrum are well-fit by a pure-accretion disk
model. Adopting a distance of $d=1.5$ kpc, the accretion and central star
parameters are: $\dot{M} = 10^{-5.48}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, $M_* = 0.17 \
M_\odot$, and $R_\mathrm{inner} = 1.04 \ R_\odot$. Other fitted values are disk
inclination $i=5.9$ deg and source extinction $A_V=1.83$ mag. These parameters
yield accretion luminosity $L_\mathrm{acc} = 8.4\ L_\odot$ and maximum disk
temperature $T_{\rm{max}} = 6218$ K.

### [28] [Exoplanet Detection with Microlensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10621)
*Aparna Bhattacharya*

**TL;DR**: 利用微引力透镜方法探测太阳系类似系外行星，特别是低质量、宽轨道的行星，是Nancy Grace Roman太空望远镜的主要科学目标之一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 尽管已发现数千颗系外行星，但大多数是靠近宿主恒星的热行星，而雪线以外的行星（被认为是行星形成的主要区域）却很少被发现。2010年的十年调查将探测这类行星并测量其质量列为NASA下一代旗舰任务的重要科学目标。

Data: Nancy Grace Roman太空望远镜计划在2026年底至2027年5月前发射，将对银河系核球进行6个季节的观测。

Method: 使用微引力透镜方法探测和测量宽轨道低质量太阳系类似行星。

Result: 预计将发现并测量1000多颗宽轨道低质量太阳系类似行星的质量。

Abstract: Microlensing is the method of exoplanet detection that discovers solar system
analog exoplanets. These are planets low in mass located in wide orbits around
their host stars. Even though thousands of exoplanets are discovered, they are
mostly hot planets close to their hosts. There is a dearth of exoplanets
discovered beyond the snowline where exoplanets are thought to be formed. This
was recognized as a very important science issue; 2010 decadal survey declared
detecting exoplanets with microlensing and measuring their masses as one of the
three main science goals of NASA's next flagship mission, Nancy Grace Roman
Space Telescope. Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope is scheduled to launch in
late 2026, no later than May 2027. It will observe 6 seasons of galactic bulge
to discover and measure masses of 1000+ such wide orbit low mass solar system
analog planets.
