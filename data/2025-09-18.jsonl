However, in massive mergers,\nintegrals of motion are not strictly conserved, redistributing accreted stars\nacross dynamical spaces, such as energy-angular momentum ($E-L_z$).\nAdditionally, the in situ disc becomes kinematically heated, acquiring\nhalo-like orbits. Consequently, even for minor mergers, which should preserve\ndynamical coherence, we expect their kinematic-defined samples to be\ncontaminated by both the massive merger(s) and the disc stars. This study aims\nat quantifying this contamination in known accreted halo substructures. As they\nare defined by kinematics, we aim at cleaning their samples analysing only\nchemical properties. We applied the kinematic selection criteria for the halo\nsubstructures to the Gaia EDR3 and APOGEE DR17 data. Then we adopted a Gaussian\nMixture Model approach to chemically compare different substructures on a\nstar-by-star basis, taking into account several abundances (Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, Mn,\nAl, and C). We argue that the chemical properties of Sequoia point towards a\nshared origin with GSE. Heracles, Thamnos and the Helmi Stream all likely\ncomprise GSE and heated disc stars in a significant amount. Besides these two\npopulations, we identified stars with chemical and orbital properties\ncompatible with Sagittarius in the Helmi Stream and with $\\omega$ Cen in\nThamnos. Finally, GSE itself is contaminated by Sagittarius. Halo stars\nchemically compatible with GSE are spread throughout the $E-L_z$ space and\nconsiderably contaminate every halo substructure studied in this work. None of\nthese substructures appears to be a unique population of stars with its own\norigin. In addition to GSE, they all appear to be mixtures of stars chemically\ncompatible either with the metal-poor disc, Sagittarius, $\\omega$ Cen, or with\na combination of them."}

Nessie employs the\nfriends-of-friends (FoF) algorithm and requires only on-sky position and\nredshift as input, making it immediately applicable to surveys that lack a\nwell-defined luminosity function. We implement several algorithmic\noptimizations including binary search and k-d tree pre-selection that\nsignificantly improve performance by reducing unnecessary galaxy pair checks.\nTo validate the accuracy of Nessie, we tune its parameters using a suite of\nGALFORM mock lightcones and achieve a strong Figure of Merit. We further\ndemonstrate its reliability by applying it to both the GAMA and SDSS surveys,\nwhere it produces group catalogues consistent with those in the literature.\nAdditional functionality is included for comparison with simulations and mock\ncatalogues. Benchmarking on a standard MacBook Pro (M3 chip with 11 cores)\nshows that version 1 of Nessie can process about 1 million galaxies in around\n10 seconds, highlighting its speed and suitability for next-generation redshift\nsurveys."}

As the Sun-Earth-Moon geometry changes, Earth can\nbe observed as a spatially unresolved exoplanet at different phase angles,\nproviding important context for future observations of Earth-like exoplanets.\nHere, we present a catalog of Earthshine polarization spectra obtained with\nFORS2 on the VLT, covering diverse scenes, surface conditions, cloud\nproperties, and weather patterns for over a decade. For the first time, we\nmodel this extensive dataset in detail using a homogeneous modeling framework.\nPrevious efforts to model some of these spectra struggled to reproduce the\nobserved polarization continuum, even with advanced 3D radiative transfer\nmodels incorporating satellite-derived surface and atmospheric data. We improve\nupon this with a 3D model that includes subgrid cloud variability,\nwavelength-dependent surface albedo maps, and an accurate treatment of ocean\nglint. Our simulations successfully reproduce most observed spectra to a much\nhigher precision than previously possible. Our statistical analysis reveals\nthat the spectral slope in the visible can distinguish between ocean and mixed\nsurfaces in both reflected and polarized light, which is not possible using\nbroadband filters alone. Polarized light at large phase angles, beyond the\nRayleigh scattering regime, is particularly effective in differentiating oceans\nfrom land, unlike reflected light. We also identify correlations between cloud\noptical thickness and the polarized spectral slope, and between cloud cover and\nbroadband B-R differences in reflected light, demonstrating the diagnostic\npower of these observations. This work highlight the potential of polarization\nfor characterizing Earth-like exoplanets. From polarization alone, we can infer\noceans, vegetation, and an active water cycle, key indicators of a habitable\nplanet."}

The PAH fraction, the\nabundance of PAHs relative to total dust mass, is a key parameter in ISM\nphysics. Using JWST and MUSE observations of 42 galaxies from the PHANGS\nsurvey, we analyze the PAH fraction in over 17 000 H II regions spanning a\ngas-phase oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) = 8.0-8.8 (Z ~ 0.2-1.3 Zsun), and\n~400 isolated supernova remnants (SNRs). We find a significantly lower PAH\nfraction toward H II regions compared to a reference sample of diffuse ISM\nareas at matched metallicity. At 12+log(O/H) > 8.2, the PAH fraction toward H\nII regions is strongly anti-correlated with the local ionization parameter,\nsuggesting that PAH destruction is correlated with ionized gas and/or\nhydrogen-ionizing UV radiation. At lower metallicities, the PAH fraction\ndeclines steeply in both H II regions and the diffuse ISM, likely reflecting\nless efficient PAH formation in metal-poor environments. Carefully isolating\ndust emission from the vicinity of optically-identified supernova remnants, we\nsee evidence for selective PAH destruction from measurements of lower PAH\nfractions, which is, however, indistinguishable at ~50 pc scales.

It provides accelerated inference using the normalizing flow\nbased sampler called flowMC and is also compatible with NumPyro samplers.\n  To validate our framework, we generated two synthetic populations, one\ncomprising spinning eccentric binaries and the other circular binaries using a\nmulti-source model. We then recovered their injected parameters at\nsignificantly reduced computational cost and demonstrated that eccentricity\ndistribution can be recovered even in spinning eccentric populations. We also\nreproduced results from two prior studies: one on non-spinning eccentric\npopulations, and another on the BBH mass distribution using the third\nGravitational Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3).\n  We anticipate that GWKokab will not only reduce computational costs but also\nenable more detailed subpopulation analyses such as their mass, spin,\neccentricity, and redshift distributions in gravitational wave events, offering\ndeeper insights into compact binary formation and evolution."}

This paper is part of the LEWIS\nproject, an integral-field spectroscopic survey of ultra-diffuse galaxies\n(UDGs) in the Hydra I cluster. We use MUSE spectroscopy and new VIRCAM $H$-band\nimaging data to study the GC populations and dark matter content in four dwarf\ngalaxies. We retrieved line-of-sight velocities for all sources in the observed\nMUSE fields. Since the spectroscopic measurements are limited to relatively\nbright sources, we developed a multi-band photometric procedure to identify\nadditional GC candidates too faint for spectroscopic confirmation. GC\ncandidates were selected using a combination of photometric properties and\nmorphometric criteria. Additionally, the $H$-band observations were used to\nconstrain the stellar masses of the studied galaxies. Based on the\nspectroscopic classification, we confirm one GC in UDG3, two in UDG7, and four\nin UDG11, while UDG9 has no spectroscopically confirmed bright GCs. We identify\nfour intra-cluster GCs in the vicinity of UDG3 and UDG11, and one ultra-compact\ndwarf with a radial velocity only $\\Delta v = -85 \\pm 10\\mathrm{km\\ s^{-1}}$\nrelative to UDG7, suggesting it may be bound to it. Considering completeness\ncorrections and accounting for possible contamination, from photometry we\nestimate that the number of GCs ranges between 0 and $\\sim40$ for the\ninvestigated UDGs. Their specific frequencies suggest that three out of four\nUDGs are either GC-rich, similar to those in the Coma cluster, or belong to an\nintermediate population as seen in the Perseus cluster. Dark matter content\nestimates, inferred from GC counts and stellar mass, indicate that these\ngalaxies are dark-matter dominated, with dynamical-to-stellar mass ratios of\n$M_{\\mathrm{dyn}} / M_\\star \\sim 10-1000$."}

We use SOFIA and Herschel data to create\ncolumn density and temperature maps for each cloud.

Our plots of polarization\nspectrum slope vs. column density reveal that for each cloud there exists a\ncritical column density below which a falling polarization spectrum is not\nobserved.

One possible source\nare the ejecta of pair-instability and core collapse supernovae, but it is\nuncertain how much newly formed dust can survive the supernova reverse shock\nand be injected into the interstellar medium. We anticipate the structure of\nthe pre-shocked dust to affect how much of it survives. Yet, the structure of\ndust formed in supernova is not well understood. We present three-dimensional\nsoft-sphere, dust coagulation simulations aimed at studying the impact of\ntemperature and particle size distribution on the structure of growing dust\naggregates. Due to the qualitative nature of the concept of structure, there\nare many ways to define and quantify it, especially for an irregular aggregate.\nThus, we test four metrics commonly used in the literature in order to compare\nthe aggregate properties as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the metrics\nthemselves. Our findings show that higher temperatures result in denser, more\ncompact structures for all metrics tested. Additionally, we find that\nstructures that coagulate from a distribution of particle sizes are denser and\nmore compact than structures formed from identical particles under similar\nconditions. The latter finding, however, is true for three of the metrics\nexcept for the average number of contact points, which has proven to be the\nleast reliable of the four considered metrics."}

II distance scale", "categories": ["astro-ph.SR", "astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "Accepted for publication on A&A", "summary": "Type II Cepheids are pulsating stars that can be used as standard candles for\nold stellar populations due to their characteristic Period-Luminosity and\nPeriod-Luminosity-Colour relations. They are traditionally divided in 3\nsub-classes, namely BL Her, W Vir and RV Tauri. In this paper we focus on the\nfirst two sub-classes, to provide a new theoretical scenario and develop tools\nand relations to be adopted in distance scale and old stellar populations\nstudies. We have built new nonlinear convective pulsation models of Type II\nCepheids, computed along selected stellar evolution tracks and spanning a wide\nrange of pulsation period and stellar parameters. Three chemical compositions\nhave been taken into account. For each assumed Z and Y, models have been\ncomputed following stellar evolution predictions for off Zero Age Horizontal\nBranch evolution of stellar masses lower than typical RR Lyrae stars, crossing\nthe classical instability strip as BL Her or W Vir pulsating stars. A new\ntheoretical prediction for the instability strip boundaries of these classes of\nvariable stars has been obtained together with their dependence on metal\nabundance. The predicted light and radial velocity curves have been computed\nalong the evolution inside the strip, showing how the amplitude and the\nmorphology are affected by the position relative to the edges and by the\nluminosity and mass values. The transformation of bolometric light curves into\nvarious photometric systems allowed us to provide new theoretical\nPeriod-Luminosity and Period-Wesenheit relations for BL Her and W Vir. These\nrelations are consistent with previously published RR Lyrae model results but\nwith a smaller metallicity dependence. Moreover, the application of the\ninferred theoretical relations to Magellanic and Galactic Type II Cepheid data\nprovides results in good agreement with some independent distance estimates in\nthe literature."}

Using projected and radial velocity\ndistributions of member galaxies, we identify cores as dense structures that,\ndespite being gravitationally bound, are not yet dynamically relaxed. However,\nthey exhibit a tendency toward virialisation, evolving in a self-similar manner\nto massive galaxy clusters but on a larger scale. Morphological analysis\nreveals that cores are predominantly filamentary, reflecting quasi-linear\nformation processes consistent with the Zeldovich approximation. Our estimates\nof the entropy confirm their intermediate dynamical state, with relaxation\nlevels varying across the sample. Mass estimates indicate efficient accretion\nprocesses, concentrating matter into gravitationally bound systems. We conclude\nthat cores are important environments where galaxy evolution and hierarchical\nassembly occur, bridging the gap between supercluster-scale structures and\nvirialised clusters."}

The BKE criterion is then\nformulated to formalize this approach while we also discuss ways to falsify the\nconjecture.
