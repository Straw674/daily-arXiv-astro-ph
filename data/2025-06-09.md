### [1] [Variable Modified Newtonian Mechanics VII: Supermassive Black Hole at very high redshift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05423)
*James C. C. Wong*

**TL;DR**: 通过新模型研究发现，改变红移-宇宙时间关系为高红移超大质量黑洞的形成提供了足够的宇宙时间，且模型与低红移观测一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 目前观测到的位于大质量星系中的高红移超大质量黑洞对基于Lambda CDM模型的黑洞和大质量星系形成理论提出了挑战，该模型预测的哈勃常数与晚期观测存在矛盾。

Data: 未明确提及具体数据，但涉及高红移超大质量黑洞的观测和晚期观测（z<1）的哈勃参数-红移关系。

Method: 采用了一种新模型，该模型基于引力系统中两个渐近解（如膨胀宇宙背景中的中心质量或包含辐射和重子的膨胀背景）叠加自由落体速度的理论解。

Result: 研究发现，改变红移-宇宙时间关系为高红移超大质量黑洞的形成提供了足够的宇宙时间，且模型的哈勃参数-红移关系与低红移（z<1）的观测结果一致。

Abstract: Observations of Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) at very high redshift hosted
by massive galaxy provide a challenge to the SMBH and massive galaxy formation
models which are predicated on the Lambda CDM model that predicts a Hubble
constant currently in tension with late time observations. In a gravitational
system with two asymptotic solutions such as a central mass in an expanding
cosmological background or an expanding background with radiation and baryons,
we find that a particle's free falling speed resulting from adding the free
falling speeds due to the asymptotic solutions is also a theoretically viable
solution [1]-[2]. In this work, we use this new model to examine the SMBH
formation time-line and find that the change in the redshift-cosmological time
relation provides sufficent cosmological time for the formation of SMBHs at
high redshifts. We also find that the Hubble parameter-redshift relation in
this model is consistent with late time observation at z<1.

*Benedikt S. Seidl,Max Gronke,Ryan Jeffrey Farber,Klaus Dolag*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过三维流体动力学模拟探讨了冷气体云在多相星系风中的集体生存条件，提出了基于有效体积填充分数的新多云生存准则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 冷气体云在高速外流中的生存对多相星系风的动力学至关重要，但现有研究主要集中在理想化的单个云上，缺乏对复杂形态的冷气体云的集体生存条件的系统研究。

Data: 研究使用了三维流体动力学模拟数据，模拟了多个球形冷气体云在高速外流中的行为。

Method: 通过三维流体动力学模拟，系统研究了冷气体云在多相外流中的生存条件，提出了基于有效体积填充分数（F_V）的多云生存准则。

Result: 研究发现，冷气体云集体生存的关键因素包括紧密排列、云间距离小和高度碎片化，并提出了一个通用的临界体积填充分数（F_V,crit≈0.24）来区分生存与破坏的系统。

Abstract: The ram-pressure acceleration of cold gas by hot outflows plays a crucial
role in the dynamics of multiphase galactic winds. Recent numerical studies
incorporating radiative cooling have identified a size threshold for idealized
cold clouds to survive within high-velocity outflows. This study extends the
investigation to a more complex morphology of cold gas as observed in the
interstellar medium. We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of
ensembles of individual spherical clouds to systematically explore under which
conditions the cold clouds can survive. We find that cloud ensembles can
survive collectively -- even when individual clouds, if isolated, would be
rapidly destroyed. Our results indicate that, besides the morphology, factors
such as tight packing, small inter-cloud distance and higher fragmentation
facilitate survival. We propose a novel multi-cloud survival criterion that
accounts for collective properties of the cloud system, including total gas
mass and the geometric configuration based on an effective volume filling
fraction of the cold gas $F_V$. This fraction is computed by constructing a
composite volume from individual enclosing conical boxes aligned with the wind,
incorporating spatial overlap and cloud-tail spreading. The box dimensions
scale with the critical survival radius $r_{\rm crit}$ from the single-cloud
criterion. We find a universal threshold $F_{V,{\rm crit}}\approx 0.24$ that
robustly separates surviving from destroyed systems across diverse geometric
configurations. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of initial cloud
distribution and fragmentation in governing the long-term evolution and
survival of cold gas structures, providing insight into observed multiphase
outflows and CGM dynamics.

### [3] [RUBIES: A Spectroscopic Census of Little Red Dots; All V-Shaped Point Sources Have Broad Lines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05459)

Maseda,Ian McConachie,Jorryt Matthee,Rohan P. Naidu,Pascal A. Oesch,Bingjie Wang,Katherine E. Whitaker,Christina Williams*

**TL;DR**: 通过RUBIES光谱调查，研究者系统分析了高红移星系的光谱特征，发现并定义了具有宽巴尔默线、V形连续谱和点源特征的光谱LRDs，揭示了现有光度选择方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Little Red Dots (LRDs)是一类由JWST发现的致密红色星系，其物理性质尚不明确，目前的光度样本选择标准多样且缺乏足够的光谱验证。

Data: 使用了RUBIES调查的光谱数据，覆盖了1500多个红移大于3.1的星系，包括NIRSpec/PRISM和G395M光谱。

Method: 采用了一种新颖的光谱拟合方法，同时建模NIRSpec/PRISM和G395M光谱，以识别宽巴尔默线。

Result: 发现了80个宽线源，其中28个红移大于6，并定义了36个具有V形连续谱和点源特征的光谱LRDs，表明现有光度选择方法仅能识别50-62%的LRDs。

Abstract: The physical nature of Little Red Dots (LRDs) - a population of compact, red
galaxies revealed by JWST - remains unclear. Photometric samples are
constructed from varying selection criteria with limited spectroscopic
follow-up available to test intrinsic spectral shapes and prevalence of broad
emission lines. We use the RUBIES survey, a large spectroscopic program with
wide color-morphology coverage and homogeneous data quality, to systematically
analyze the emission-line kinematics, spectral shapes, and morphologies of
$\sim$1500 galaxies at $z > 3.1$. We identify broad Balmer lines via a novel
fitting approach that simultaneously models NIRSpec/PRISM and G395M spectra,
yielding 80 broad-line sources with 28 (35%) at $z > 6$. A large subpopulation
naturally emerges from the broad Balmer line sources, with 36 exhibiting
`v-shaped' UV-to-optical continua and a dominant point source component in the
rest-optical; we define these as spectroscopic LRDs, constituting the largest
such sample to date. Strikingly, the spectroscopic LRD population is largely
recovered when either a broad line or rest-optical point source is required in
combination with a v-shaped continuum, suggesting an inherent link between
these three defining characteristics. We compare the spectroscopic LRD sample
to published photometric searches. Although these selections have high
accuracy, down to $\rm F444W<26.5$, only 50-62% of the RUBIES LRDs were
previously identified. The remainder were missed due to a mixture of faint
rest-UV photometry, comparatively blue rest-optical colors, or highly uncertain
photometric redshifts. Our findings highlight that well-selected spectroscopic
campaigns are essential for robust LRD identification, while photometric
criteria require refinement to capture the full population.

### [4] [The DECam Field of Streams: a deep view of the Milky Way halo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05469)
*Peter Ferguson,Nora Shipp*

**TL;DR**: 利用DECam观测数据，通过等时线匹配滤波方法，揭示了银河系晕中的多种恒星结构，包括矮星系、球状星团和大量恒星流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 银河系晕中的恒星结构研究近年来取得了显著进展，但需要更深入的广域光度测量来揭示其构成。

Data: 使用Dark Energy Survey和DECam Legacy Survey的g和r波段成像数据，覆盖18,700平方度的天空。

Method: 采用基于等时线的匹配滤波方法，在g vs. g-r图中选择老金属贫恒星，并生成假彩色RGB图像。

Result: 揭示了银河系晕中的多种恒星结构，包括矮星系、球状星团和大量恒星流，展示了广域光度测量的重要性。

Abstract: We present a Field of Streams visualizing stellar structures in the Milky Way
halo as viewed by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). We use $g$- and $r$-band
imaging from the Dark Energy Survey and the DECam Legacy Survey, covering
$18{,}700 \deg^2$ across the sky. Using an isochrone-based matched filter in
$g$ vs. $g-r$, we select old and metal-poor stars in three distance bins, and
generate a false-color RGB image of the number density of selected stars. The
DECam Field of Streams shows a variety of Milky Way halo structures, including
dwarf galaxies, globular clusters, and an abundance of stellar streams,
illustrating the significant progress that has been made in recent years in
uncovering the building blocks of the Milky Way's stellar halo in deep,
wide-area photometric surveys. This view of our Galaxy will be improved in the
coming years as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time
(LSST) begins to collect data to greater depths and across a larger fraction of
the sky than ever before.

### [5] [Probing neutral outflows in z ~ 2 galaxies using JWST observations of Ca II H and K absorption lines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05470)

**TL;DR**: 利用JWST/NIRSpec光谱数据，首次系统研究了宇宙正午时期大质量星系中的中性气体含量，发现Ca II和Na I吸收线可用于估算中性氢的柱密度，为中性气体外流质量提供了新的校准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 在宇宙正午时期（1.8 < z < 2.8），大质量星系的中性气体含量及其动力学行为对理解星系演化至关重要，但此前缺乏系统性研究。

Data: 使用了来自Blue Jay调查的JWST/NIRSpec深光谱数据，分析了9个恒星质量大于10.6的大质量星系样本。

Method: 通过Prospector模型去除恒星连续谱，拟合Ca II H、K双线和Na I D双线中的中性气体吸收以及附近电离气体的发射线，测量了覆盖分数、速度偏移、速度弥散和柱密度。

Result: 研究发现约一半星系表现出Ca II蓝移，表明中性气体外流；Ca II和Na I的柱密度相关但不呈1:1关系，提出了Ca II和Na I柱密度之间的经验关系，可用于估算中性氢柱密度和外流质量。

Abstract: Using deep JWST/NIRSpec spectra from the Blue Jay survey, we perform the
first systematic investigation of neutral gas content in massive galaxies at
Cosmic Noon based on the Ca II H, K absorption lines. We analyze a sample of 9
galaxies at 1.8 < z < 2.8 with stellar masses > 10.6, for which we detect
neutral gas absorption both in Ca II and in Na I. After removing the stellar
continuum using the best-fit model obtained with Prospector, we fit the excess
absorption due to neutral gas in the Ca II H, K doublet and in the Na I D
doublet, together with nearby emission lines produced by ionized gas. We
measure covering fractions between 0.2 and 0.9 from the Ca II H and K lines,
which are spectrally well resolved in the NIRSpec R ~ 1000 observations, unlike
the absorption lines in the Na I D doublet. We measure the velocity shift,
velocity dispersion, and column density separately for Ca II and Na I. About
half of the galaxies present blueshifted Ca II, indicative of an outflow of
neutral gas, consistent with previous results based on Na I. The velocity shift
and the column density measured from Ca II are correlated with those measured
from Na I, implying that these absorption lines trace gas in similar physical
conditions. However, the column densities are not in a 1:1 relation, meaning
that the relative amount of Ca II and Na I atoms along the line of sight varies
with the gas column density. After discussing possible reasons for this
behavior, we derive an empirical relation between the column density of Ca II
and the column density of Na I and, in a more indirect way, of neutral hydrogen
H I. This calibration offers a new way to estimate the outflow mass and the
mass outflow rate for the neutral phase from current and future JWST
observations of massive galaxies at Cosmic Noon and beyond

*Shalini Kurinchi-Vendhan,Eric Rohr,Annalisa Pillepich,Elad Zinger,Mohammadreza Ayromlou,Gandhali D. Joshi*

**TL;DR**: 研究发现，水母星系比相同质量的中心星系更可能拥有活跃星系核（AGN），这可能是由于强压剥离作用导致气体压缩，从而促进了超大质量黑洞的吸积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 水母星系是星系因密集环境效应而发生极端转变的典型例子，它们因强压剥离作用形成独特的气体尾迹。近期观测研究表明，水母星系比相同质量的中心星系更可能拥有活跃星系核（AGN），暗示了强压剥离与超大质量黑洞吸积之间的联系。

Data: 研究使用了IllustrisTNG宇宙学磁流体动力学模拟（TNG50和TNG100）以及Zooniverse的“宇宙水母”公民科学项目的数据，分析了恒星质量在10的9.5到10.8次方太阳质量之间、红移z=0的水母星系。

Method: 研究通过比较水母星系与中心星系及相同质量的卫星星系，分析了AGN的存在概率及其与恒星质量、气体含量和强压剥离强度的关系，并结合个别星系的案例研究进行了群体分析。

Result: 研究发现，水母星系比中心星系和相同质量的卫星星系更可能拥有高光度AGN（L_AGN≥10的44次方erg/s），尤其是在高恒星质量（M_stellar≳10的10次方M_⊙）的情况下。强压剥离通过气体压缩促进了AGN活动和恒星形成，表明环境过程对卫星星系演化至关重要。

Abstract: Jellyfish galaxies are extreme examples of how galaxies can transform due to
dense environmental effects. These satellite galaxies suffer from ram-pressure
stripping, leading to the formation of their distinctive gaseous tails. Some
recent observational studies find that jellyfish galaxies are more likely to
host active galactic nuclei (AGN) compared to central galaxies of the same
mass, suggesting a link between ram pressure and supermassive black hole (SMBH)
accretion. We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological-magnetohydrodynamical
simulations, namely TNG50 and TNG100, to explore the presence of AGN in
jellyfish galaxies with $M_{\rm{stellar}}\simeq10^{9.5-10.8}\,\rm{M}_\odot$ at
redshift $z=0$ from the Zooniverse "Cosmological Jellyfish" citizen-science
project. Compared to central galaxies, jellyfish are more likely to host an AGN
($L_{\rm AGN}\geq10^{44}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$) particularly at high stellar
masses ($M_{\rm stellar}\gtrsim10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$). Jellyfish are also
more likely to host an AGN than satellites of the same mass, largely because
many satellite galaxies are gas-poor and therefore have lower SMBH accretion
rates. Compared to non-jellyfish satellites with similar gas content, jellyfish
typically undergo stronger ram pressure and have higher central gas densities
along with lower central gas sound speeds, although these effects are smaller
at lower stellar masses ($M_{\rm stellar}\lesssim10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$).
Together with case studies of individual galaxies, our population analysis
indicates that ram pressure can play a key role in fuelling AGN activity in a
large fraction of jellyfish, where gas compression can lead to intense episodes
of AGN feedback and star formation. Thus, it is essential to consider both
environmental and secular processes for a more complete picture of satellite
galaxy evolution.

**TL;DR**: 利用EAGLE流体动力学宇宙学模拟研究了中等X射线光度活动星系核（mXAGN）的晕占据分布（HOD），发现小合并是触发mXAGN的主要机制。


<details>

Background: 当前研究领域主要依赖暗物质模拟和经验关系来研究活动星系核（AGN）的触发机制，而本研究通过流体动力学模拟扩展了这一领域。

Data: 使用了EAGLE流体动力学宇宙学模拟的数据，分析了质量≥10^12.75 M⊙ h^-1的星系群和类星系团系统的晕。

Method: 通过分析模拟数据，创建了中心星系和卫星星系的目录，并研究了它们的合并历史，量化了mXAGN样本中小合并和大合并的比例。

Result: 结果表明，在大多数红移范围内，小合并略微占主导地位，是触发mXAGN的主要机制。

Abstract: The hydrodynamical cosmological simulation \eagle{} is used to model the Halo
Occupation Distribution (HOD) of moderate X-ray luminosity active galactic
nuclei (mXAGN), extending previous work using only dark matter simulations and
empirical relations. By examining mergers as a triggering mechanism, we focus
on halos typical of galaxy groups and cluster-like systems with masses $\geq
10^{12.75}\,{\rm M}{\odot}\,h^{-1}$. We analyze simulation data to create
catalogs of central and satellite galaxies. We study their merger history we
quantify the percentage of minor and major mergers in the mXAGN sample. We
obtain the HOD for central and satellite mXAGN across a redshift interval from
\(z=2\) to the present epoch. Our results indicate that, across most redshifts,
minor mergers slightly predominate as the primary mechanism for triggering
mXAGN.

*Peter Craig,Sukanya Chakrabarti,Alexander R. Pettitt,Robyn Sanderson,Erik Rosolowsky*

**TL;DR**: 研究者提出了一种名为“模式匹配”的新方法，通过利用附近年轻恒星的距离来绘制银河系中性氢气体分布，避免了传统运动学距离的局限性，并显示出更高的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 天文学家五十多年来一直使用运动学距离绘制银河系中性氢气体分布图，但这种方法存在局限性。本研究通过利用附近年轻恒星的距离来追踪其形成的气体，提出了一种新的方法。

Data: 研究使用了附近年轻恒星的距离数据、脉动变星（Cepheids）的视差和速度数据，以及模拟螺旋星系的数据。

Method: 研究者提出了一种名为“模式匹配”的新方法，通过匹配附近年轻恒星的距离和脉动变星的数据来绘制气体分布。

Result: 新模式匹配方法在距离太阳15千秒差距内的气体分布上比传统运动学距离方法准确度提高了24%，且未显示出系统偏差。

Abstract: For more than fifty years, astronomers have mapped the neutral hydrogen gas
in the Galaxy assuming kinematically derived distances. We employ the distances
of nearby young stars, which trace the gas from which they formed, in
longitude-latitude-velocity space to map this gas without using kinematic
distances. We denote this new method "pattern matching". Analysis of simulated
spiral galaxies indicates that our pattern matching distances are 24% more
accurate than kinematic distances for gas within 15 kpc of the Sun. The two
methods provide similar agreement with parallaxes towards these masers,
although the kinematic method shows a small systematic offset in the distance
that is not present in the pattern matching distance. Using parallaxes and
velocities for masers, we show that this novel method, when matched with nearby
Cepheids, performs well compared to kinematics. This analysis is restricted to
sources that have a reasonably good match with a member of our Cepheid sample.
The distances derived here, and the associated map, have broad utility - from
improving our understanding of star formation and the dynamical structure of
the Galaxy, to informing 3-D dust maps.

*Yuri A. Shchekinov,Biman B. Nath*

**TL;DR**: 本文探讨了高红移（z>5）星系中尘埃质量异常高的现象，提出超新星喷射物中尘埃的强辐射冷却可能有效抑制反向激波对尘埃的破坏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 在高红移（z>5）星系中，尘埃的存在通常与核心坍缩超新星（SN）有关。近年来，探测到尘埃质量异常高的星系，其尘埃质量占星系恒星质量的1-3%。然而，反向激波（RS）会通过溅射破坏超新星喷射物中形成的尘埃颗粒，导致每颗超新星注入星际气体的净尘埃质量仅为约0.1太阳质量，这使得解释z>5星系中尘埃质量高达恒星质量1-3%的现象变得极具挑战性。

Data: 研究使用了高红移（z>5）星系中尘埃质量的数据，特别是那些尘埃质量占恒星质量1-3%的星系。

Method: 本文提出了一种理论模型，认为超新星喷射物中尘埃的强辐射冷却可能有效抑制反向激波对尘埃的溅射破坏。

Result: 研究结果表明，尘埃的强辐射冷却可能是抑制反向激波破坏的关键机制，从而解释了高红移星系中异常高的尘埃质量现象。

Abstract: The presence of dust in galaxies at redshifts $z>5$ is commonly connected
with core collapse supernovae (SN). Galaxies with exceptionally large dust
mass, of order of $1 - 3$\% of the galaxy stellar mass, have been detected
during the last decade. The required SN dust yield is $\gtrsim 1~M_\odot$ per
supernova, which is comparable to the theoretically predicted maximum. However,
the reverse shock (RS) penetrating the SN ejecta significantly destroy the dust
particles nucleating there through sputtering. The resulting net dust mass
injected into the interstellar gas after processing by the RS turns out to be
$\lesssim 0.1~M_\odot$ per SN. This makes the explanation of the existence of
$z>5$ galaxies with dust masses as high as $M_d\gtrsim (0.01-0.03)M_\ast$ a
challenging one. In this paper we present arguments in favor of an efficient
inhibition of the sputtering behind the RS, caused by a strong radiation
cooling from the dust in the supernova ejecta.

### [10] [Trinity VII. Predictions for the Observable Correlation Functions of Accreting Black Holes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05612)
*Oddisey Knox,Haowen Zhang,Peter Behroozi*

**TL;DR**: Trinity模型通过观测数据验证了其预测的类星体相关函数与观测结果一致，支持了其对超大质量黑洞与暗物质晕关系的推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Trinity模型通过类星体光度函数、活动星系核占据比例和超大质量黑洞质量-星系质量关系等约束，推断出超大质量黑洞质量、星系质量和暗物质晕质量之间的红移依赖关系，但未使用相关函数作为约束。

Data: 使用了红移范围在0到3.5之间的观测两点投影和红移空间相关函数的汇编数据。

Method: 通过比较Trinity模型预测的类星体相关函数与观测结果，验证模型的准确性。

Result: Trinity模型准确预测了类星体相关函数，与观测误差范围内一致，表明其对类星体在宿主星系和暗物质晕中的位置推断正确；同时预测了类星体光度对聚类的影响，但现有观测不确定性较大，无法显示显著差异。

Abstract: The quasar correlation function assesses the occurrence of quasar pairs as a
function of separation, which is strongly influenced by quasar host halo
masses. The empirical Trinity model recently inferred the redshift-dependent
relationship between supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, galaxy mass, and halo
mass, using constraints other than correlation functions (e.g., quasar
luminosity functions, active galactic nuclei occupation fractions, and SMBH
mass-bulge mass relations). Hence, comparing the predicted quasar correlation
functions from Trinity to real observations is an important test of Trinity's
inferred SMBH -- halo relation. In this work, we use a compilation of observed
two-point projected and redshift-space correlation functions from $0 \leq z
\leq 3.5$. We find that Trinity accurately predicts quasar correlation
functions within observed error bars, although observations do not have much
constraining power at lower redshifts due to smaller observable volumes and
lower quasar number densities. This finding is consistent with Trinity having
the correct placement of quasars within their host galaxies and dark matter
halos, without requiring quasar clustering constraints during model fitting.
Using Trinity, we also predict the clustering as a function of quasar
bolometric luminosity, finding that existing survey uncertainties are too large
to show measurable differences ($\lesssim 0.3$ dex change in bias for $10^{42}$
erg s$^{-1}$ compared to $10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ SMBHs across redshifts). This
fact arises because most SMBH growth (and hence quasar luminosity) occurs in
halos in a similar mass range ($10^{12}-10^{13} M_\odot$).

**TL;DR**: 本文通过LBT望远镜的LUCI光谱仪对M87星系进行K波段光谱分析，研究了不同化学元素吸收特征的径向分布，并与M31星系进行比较，发现现有恒星种群模型在近红外波段存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 巨型椭圆星系M87的K波段光谱研究对于理解其恒星种群和化学演化具有重要意义，但目前对近红外波段的光谱特征及其与光学波段模型的匹配情况仍存在较大不确定性。

Data: 使用LBT望远镜的LUCI光谱仪获取的M87星系的K波段光谱数据。

Method: 通过分析K波段吸收特征（如Fe、Mg、Ca、Na和CO）的线强度随星系中心距离的变化，并与M31星系的光谱数据进行比较。

Result: 研究发现M87的K波段光谱特征大多呈现平坦的径向分布，但NaI2.21向外递减；M87与M31的光谱特征存在显著差异；现有恒星种群模型仅能匹配Na和Ca指数，其他指数存在显著不匹配，表明近红外波段的模型需要改进。

Abstract: We present new K-band spectroscopy for the giant elliptical galaxy M87 in the
Virgo cluster, taken with the LUCI spectrograph at the Large Binocular
Telescope (LBT). The new data are used to study line-strengths of K-band
absorption features from different chemical species, namely Fe, Mg, Ca, Na, and
CO, as a function of galactocentric distance, out to 40arcsec from the center
(about half of the galaxy effective radius). The radial trends of spectral
indices are compared to those for the bulge of M31, observed with the same
instrument. For M87, most K-band indices exhibit flat radial profiles, with the
exception of NaI2.21, that decreases outwards, with a negative radial gradient.
Significant offsets are found between indices for M87 and those for the bulge
of M31, the latter having weaker line-strengths for almost all features, but Fe
and Ca, for which we find similar trends in both systems. We find that the
behavior of CO features - most prominent in giant stars - is difficult to
explain, consistent with previous results for the central regions of massive
galaxies. In particular, the CO indices are stronger in M87 than M31, and do
not exhibit significant radial gradients in M87, despite its IMF being bottom
heavier than M31 especially in its central region. Predictions of
state-of-the-art stellar population models, based on results from the optical
spectral range, are able to match only the Na and Ca indices of M87, while a
significant mismatch is found for all other indices. This shows that
state-of-the-art stellar population models should be improved significantly in
order to provide reliable constraints on the stellar population content of
galaxies in the NIR spectral range.

**TL;DR**: 通过离散化学动力学建模分析银河系中心约200 pc区域内的恒星动力学和金属丰度，揭示了超大质量黑洞质量、暗物质贡献及恒星种群起源的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 银河系中心约200 pc区域内包含核恒星盘和核星团，这些恒星系统在空间上重叠，使得分离恒星、推断其内部动力学及推导中心引力势变得困难。离散恒星动力学和金属丰度等化学示踪剂可用于区分具有不同动力学特性的恒星种群。

Abstract: The inner ~200 pc region of the Milky Way contains a nuclear stellar disc and
a nuclear star cluster that are embedded in the larger Galactic bar. These
stellar systems overlap spatially, which makes it challenging to separate stars
that belong to the nuclear stellar systems, to deduce their internal dynamics,
and to derive the central Galactic potential. Discrete stellar kinematics probe
the mass distribution of a stellar system, and chemical tracers such as stellar
metallicity can further separate multiple stellar populations that can have
distinct kinematic properties. We took advantage of the information provided by
discrete stellar kinematics and the metallicity in the Galactic centre using
discrete chemo-dynamical modelling. We fitted axisymmetric Jeans models to
discrete data of 4,600 stars. We fitted the stars as either one population plus
a background component or as two populations plus a background that represents
the bar. We tested the robustness of the inferred gravitational potential
against a varying mass of the supermassive black hole, including dark matter,
or a radially varying mass-to-light ratio. We obtained robust results on the
fit with a single population and a background component. We obtained a
supermassive black hole mass of (4.35$\pm 0.24) \times 10^6$ M$_\odot$, and we
find that a dark matter component and radial variation in the mass-to-light
ratio are negligible. We derived the enclosed mass profile of the inner ~60 pc
and found a lower mass than reported in the literature in the region of ~5-30
pc. In our two-population fit, we found a high-[M/H] population that
contributes more than 90% to the total stellar density. The properties of the
high-[M/H] population are consistent with in situ formation after gas inflow
from the Galactic disc via the bar. The distinct kinematic properties of the
low-[M/H] population indicate a different origin. [abridged]

**TL;DR**: The study confirms five new OH megamaser host galaxies and reidentifies two previously misclassified ones, supporting predictions for distinguishing OHMs from HI emitters using near- to mid-IR photometry and emission line frequencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: OH megamasers (OHMs) are rare extragalactic masers found in gas-rich galaxy mergers, with only about 120 cataloged since their discovery in 1982. Next-generation telescopes and 21 cm HI surveys are expected to significantly increase OHM detections, but these risk confusion with HI emitters without independent spectroscopic redshifts.

Data: Data from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey and a preliminary Apertif HI emission line catalog from the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope were used, along with optical spectroscopic redshifts of 142 candidates obtained via the Apache Point Observatory 3.5m telescope.

Method: The study applied techniques proposed by Roberts et al. (arXiv:2102.12486) for distinguishing OHMs from HI emitters using near- to mid-IR photometry and emission line frequencies.

Result: Five new OHM host galaxies were confirmed, and two previously cataloged OHMs misclassified as HI emitters in ALFALFA were reidentified, supporting the predictions of Roberts et al.

Abstract: OH megamasers (OHMs) are extragalactic masers found primarily in gas-rich
galaxy major mergers. To date, only $\sim$120 OHMs have been cataloged since
their discovery in 1982, and efforts to identify distinct characteristics of
OHM host galaxies have remained inconclusive. As radio astronomy advances with
next-generation telescopes and extensive 21 cm HI surveys, precursors to the
Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are expected to detect the 18 cm OH masing line
with significantly increased frequency, potentially expanding the known OHM
population tenfold. These detections, however, risk confusion with
lower-redshift HI emitters unless accompanied by independent spectroscopic
redshifts. Building on methods proposed by Roberts et al. (arXiv:2102.12486)
for distinguishing these interloping OHMs via near- to mid-IR photometry and
emission line frequencies, we apply these techniques to data from the Arecibo
Legacy Fast ALFA [Arecibo L-band Feed Array] (ALFALFA) survey and a preliminary
APERture Tile In Focus (Apertif) HI emission line catalog from the Westerbork
Synthesis Radio Telescope. Our study, utilizing the Apache Point Observatory
3.5m telescope to obtain optical spectroscopic redshifts of 142 candidates (107
from ALFALFA and 35 from Apertif), confirms five new OHM host galaxies and
reidentifies two previously catalogued OHMs misclassified as HI emitters in
ALFALFA. These findings support the predictions from Roberts et al.
(arXiv:2102.12486 [astro-ph.GA]) and underscore the evolving landscape of radio
astronomy in the context of next-generation telescopes.

Background: 近期研究表明，银河系和仙女座星系M31中湍流分子云的密度结构与流体静力平衡和维里平衡的预期一致。

Data: 研究使用了M31分子云的观测表面密度数据。

Method: 研究通过将观测数据与Lane-Emden方程的空间平均解进行匹配来分析密度分布。

Result: 研究证实M31分子云的密度分布符合流体静力平衡的预期，并支持云内所有半径处均满足维里平衡的结论，同时发现银河系和河外星系的分子云具有相似的动力学状态。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that the density structure of turbulent molecular
clouds in the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy, M31, aligns with expectations
from hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) and virial equilibrium (VE). This study
extends the study of the M31 clouds by matching their observed surface
densities to a spatially-averaged solution of the Lane-Emden equation. The
results affirm that the M31 molecular clouds exhibit density profiles expected
from HE, further supporting the earlier conclusion that VE holds at all radii
within the clouds. This study also discusses HE in the context of the turbulent
interstellar medium, considering energy balance, cloud lifetimes, and the
pressure of the interstellar medium. A comparison between the Galactic and
extragalactic clouds indicates that both share similar dynamical states. These
findings contribute to a broader understanding of the interplay between
turbulence, gravitational stability, and cloud evolution in the molecular
interstellar medium.

**TL;DR**: 本研究通过半解析星系演化模型A-SLOTH，探讨了初始质量函数（IMF）的高质量端对高红移星系化学演化的影响，并发现观测数据支持超200太阳质量的恒星在高红移星系中的重要作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系中的恒星形成和金属富集受超新星爆炸和大质量恒星金属产出的调控，这些过程对初始质量函数（IMF）的高质量端敏感。近期JWST观测发现，恒星质量、金属丰度和恒星形成率之间的关系在红移z∼8以下保持不变，但在更高红移下出现分歧。理解其背后的物理机制，尤其是IMF的作用，至关重要。

Data: 研究使用了从红移z∼4到10的观测数据，包括宇宙恒星形成历史和恒星质量-金属丰度-恒星形成率关系（MZSFR）。

Method: 研究采用了半解析星系演化代码A-SLOTH，结合基于宇宙学模拟构建的合并树，追踪星系重子循环。恒星反馈模型使用了覆盖全金属丰度范围（Z∼10−11−0.03）和宽恒星质量范围（m⋆∼2−600太阳质量）的最新恒星演化轨迹，包括恒星风、核心坍缩超新星、（脉动）对不稳定超新星和Ia型超新星的金属产出。

Result: 研究发现，IMF的高质量端上限m_max需大于等于200太阳质量才能重现观测到的MZSFR关系。红移z≳6的观测数据支持一种星系外流模型，其中外流质量与超新星能量和晕束缚能量之比成正比。研究还讨论了这些结果对电磁波和引力波瞬变源的潜在影响。

Abstract: Star formation and metal enrichment in galaxies are regulated by supernova
(SN) explosions and metal yields from massive stars, which are sensitive to the
high-mass end of the initial mass function (IMF). Recent JWST observations have
reached a consensus on an invariant relation between stellar mass, metallicity,
and star formation rate up to $z\sim 8$ and its breakdown at higher redshifts.
It is crucial to understand the underlying physics, especially the role played
by the IMF. We explore the impact of IMF on the chemical evolution of
high-redshift galaxies and the interplay between IMF and galactic outflows. The
ultimate goal is to constrain the high-mass end of the IMF by the cosmic star
formation history and stellar mass-metallicity-star formation rate relation
(MZSFR) inferred from observations at $z\sim 4-10$. Using the semi-analytical
galaxy evolution code A-SLOTH, we follow galactic baryon cycles along merger
trees built from cosmological simulations. Stellar feedback is modeled with
up-to-date stellar evolution tracks covering the full metallicity range ($Z
\sim 10^{-11} - 0.03$) and a broad stellar mass range ($m_\star\sim2 - 600\ \rm
M_\odot$) including the metal yields from stellar winds, core-collapse SNe,
(pulsational) pair-instability SNe, and Type Ia SNe. Assuming that the IMF
follows a Kroupa-like shape with a varying upper mass limit $m_{\max}$, we find
$m_{\max} \gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$ is required to reproduce the observed
MZSFR. Observational data at $z\gtrsim 6$ favor a galactic outflow model where
the outflow mass is proportional to the ratio of supernova energy to halo
binding energy. We conclude that very massive ($\gtrsim 200\ \rm M_\odot$)
stars can play important roles in the star formation and chemical enrichment
histories of high-$z$ galaxies. We also discuss their implications for
transient sources of both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves.

Abstract: The interstellar hydride hydroxyl (OH) is a potential tracer of CO-dark
molecular gas. We present new absorption line observations of OH at 18-cm
wavelength towards four continuum sources. We compare these to the [CII] line
at 1.9 THz obtained with SOFIA, observations of the neutral atomic hydrogen 21
cm line with the VLA, and CO lines obtained with APEX. We trace OH over a large
range of molecular hydrogen column densities, and derive OH abundances with
respect to molecular and total hydrogen column densities. Increased sensitivity
and spectral resolution allowed us to detect weak and narrow features. We
identify only one OH absorption component out of 23 without CO counterpart, yet
several with intermediate molecular gas fractions. A potential association of
[CII] 158 mu m emission with an OH absorption component is seen toward one
sightline. Our results confirm that OH absorption traces molecular gas across
diffuse and dense environments of the interstellar medium. At the sensitivity
limits of the present observations our detection of only one CO-dark molecular
gas feature appears in agreement with previous studies. We conclude that if OH
absorption was to be used as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, deeper
observations or stronger background targets are necessary to unveil its full
potential as a CO-dark molecular gas tracer, and yet it will never be an
exclusive tracer of CO-dark molecular gas. For OH hyperfine-splitting
transitions in the vicinity of photodissociation regions in W43-South, we
detect a spectral and spatial offset between the peak of the inversion of the
OH 1612 MHz line and the absorption of the OH 1720 MHz line on the one hand,
and the absorption of the OH main lines on the other hand, which provides
additional constraints on the interpretation of the OH 18 cm line signatures
typical of HII regions.

Abstract: The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter
(DM) physics. Observations motivate current efforts to explain surprisingly
compact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless but has strong self-interactions,
halos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the
central region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse
phase from first principles. To improve on this, we seek to better understand
numerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter
(SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially we aim for a better
understanding of the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we run SIDM N-body
simulations of a low mass halo in isolation and within an external
gravitational potential. The simulation setup is motivated by the perturber of
the stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to
energy conservation errors, and a too large SIDM kernel size can artificially
speed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can
describe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have
simulated. Furthermore, for our highest-resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we
make the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the
current numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late
collapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, e.g.
that the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows to
run simulations of halos becoming concentrated enough to explain observations
of GD-1 like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.

Abstract: Surprisingly compact substructures in galaxies and galaxy clusters, but also
field halos, have been observed by gravitational lensing. They could be
difficult to explain with collisionless dark matter (DM). To explain those
objects, recent studies focused on the gravothermal collapse that halos
consisting of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) can undergo. However, simple
models of elastic scattering could face problems explaining those compact
objects during very later stages of the collapse and the post-collapse phase,
where a black hole may have formed from DM. We aim to explain compact halos
while avoiding the gravothermal catastrophe which typical SIDM models are
subject to. Therefore, we investigate the evolution of a DM halo for an SIDM
model consisting of two species with unequal masses, featuring only
interactions between the different species but not within themselves. Employing
$N$-body simulations, we study the effect of unequal-mass SIDM models on the
evolution of an isolated DM halo. In particular, the late stages of its
evolution with high central densities are simulated. We find that our
two-species SIDM models can produce density cores with their size depending on
the mass ratio of the two species. Moreover, the mass segregation caused by the
unequal particle masses leads to a finite final density state or at least a
slowly growing density, which depends on the mass ratio and the mass fraction
of the two DM species. SIDM models consisting of two DM species can
simultaneously explain DM halos with density cores, as well as systems that are
denser in their centre than expected from collisionless DM, while avoiding the
gravothermal catastrophe. They are a compelling alternative to single-species
models, offering a rich phenomenology.

Background: 射电宁静活动星系核（RQ AGN）的紧凑毫米波辐射普遍表现出自吸收特性，其起源可能为X射线冕、缩小版喷流或流出驱动的激波，毫米波偏振测量可用于验证这些假说。

Data: ALMA Band 3全偏振观测数据，包括NGC 3783、MCG 5-23-16和NGC 4945三个RQ AGN的数据，以及档案ALMA观测数据。

Method: 使用ALMA Band 3进行全偏振观测，分析毫米波偏振信号和总通量变异性。

Abstract: The compact mm emission ubiquitously found in radio-quiet active galactic
nuclei (RQ AGN) exhibits properties consistent with synchrotron radiation from
a small region ($\leq$1 light day) and undergoing self-absorption below
$\sim$100 GHz. Several scenarios have been proposed for its origin, including
an X-ray corona, a scaled-down jet, or outflow-driven shocks, which can be
tested via mm polarimetry. In the optically thin regime, synchrotron emission
is expected to show polarization up to $\sim$70\%, but disordered magnetic
fields and Faraday rotation reduce this to a few percent for jets and outflows,
while an X-ray corona is likely to result in complete depolarization. To
investigate this, we conducted the first ALMA Band 3 full-polarization
observations of three RQ AGN - NGC 3783, MCG 5-23-16, and NGC 4945. No
polarized signal was detected in any of the AGN, with an upper limit of
0.5-1.5\%, supporting the X-ray corona scenario. However, we detected a compact
source with 17\% polarization in NGC 3783, 20 pc away from the AGN, co-spatial
with the mm and narrow-line outflow, likely linked to a shock propagating
through the outflowing material. Additionally, combining our data with archival
ALMA observations, we found typical mm variability in RQ AGN by a factor of 2;
however, the sparsity of the data prevented a more detailed analysis of the
total flux variability.
