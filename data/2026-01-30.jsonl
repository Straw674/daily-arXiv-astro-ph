The characteristic spacing of these cores is a key observable imprint of fragmentation physics and is commonly measured using nearest-neighbour (NN) statistics. However, NN separations are derived from projected two-dimensional (2D) positions, while fragmentation occurs in three dimensions (3D). Using spherical and fractal toy models, we show that the standard geometric deprojection factor of $4/π\\simeq1.27$ is inadequate because projection not only foreshortens separations but also rewires the NN network, while finite angular resolution merges close neighbours and inflates apparent spacings. We quantify these competing biases with Monte Carlo experiments spanning a wide range of morphologies, sample sizes, and effective resolutions. From these we derive an empirical correction factor that depends on both sample size and resolution: for small ($N\\lesssim10$) or poorly resolved samples ($\\lesssim$10 resolution elements across the field), intrinsic NN spacings exceed projected values by only 20 to 40%, whereas for well-sampled ($N\\gtrsim100$), well-resolved data ($\\gtrsim$30-50 resolution elements), true 3D separations are typically larger by a factor of $\\sim$2. This calibration enables observers to convert measured 2D NN spacings into corresponding 3D estimates, with typical morphology-driven uncertainties of order 30 to 40%, and we demonstrate how it alters inferred fragmentation scales in observed and simulated core populations.

So far, the most direct evidence for BH*s comes from a handful of sources where the host galaxy is completely outshone as suggested by their remarkably steep Balmer breaks. Here we present a novel scheme to disentangle BH*s from their host galaxies assuming that the [OIII]5008Å line arises exclusively from the host. Using a sample of 98 LRDs ($z$~$2-9$) with high quality NIRSpec/PRISM spectra, we demonstrate that the host-subtracted median stack displays a Balmer break $>2\\times$ stronger than massive quiescent galaxies, with the rest-optical continuum resembling a blackbody-like SED ($T_{\\rm{eff}}$~$4050$ K, $\\log(L_{\\rm{bol}})$~$43.9$ erg s$^{-1}$, $R_{\\rm{eff}}$~$1300$ au). We measure a steep Balmer decrement (H$α$/H$β>10$) and numerous density-sensitive features (e.g., FeII, HeI, OI). These are hallmark signatures of dense gas envelopes, providing population-level evidence that BH*s indeed power LRDs. In the median LRD, BH*s account for $\\sim20\\%$ of the UV emission, $\\sim50\\%$ at the Balmer break, and $\\sim90\\%$ at wavelengths longer than H$α$ with the remainder arising from the host. BH*s preferentially reside in low-mass galaxies ($M_{\\rm{\\star}}$~$10^{8}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\rm{\\odot}}$) undergoing recent starbursts, as evidenced by extreme emission line EWs (e.g., [OIII]5008Å~$1100$Å, CIII]~$12$Å), thereby favoring BH* origins linked to star-formation. We show V-shaped LRD selections are biased to high BH*/host fractions ($\\gtrsim60\\%$ at 5500Å) -- less dominant BH*s may be powering JWST's blue broad-line AGN. We find BH*s are so commonplace and transient (duty cycle $\\sim1\\%$, lifetime $\\sim10$ Myrs) that every massive black hole may have once shone as a BH*."}

Bursty star formation histories (SFHs), characterized by short-term fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR), may explain this diversity, but constraining burst timescales and amplitudes in individual galaxies is challenging due to degeneracies and sensitivity limits. We introduce a population-level simulation-based inference framework that recovers the power and timescales of SFR fluctuations by forward-modeling galaxy populations and distributions of rest-UV to rest-optical spectral features sensitive to star formation timescales. We adopt a stochastic SFH model based on a power spectral density formalism spanning 1 Myr-10 Gyr. Using simulated samples of N=500 galaxies at z~4 with typical JWST/NIRSpec uncertainties, we demonstrate that: (i) the power of SFR fluctuations can be measured with sufficient precision to distinguish between simulations (e.g., FIRE-2-like vs. Illustris-like populations at >99% confidence for timescales < 100 Myr); (ii) simultaneously modeling stochastic fluctuations and the recent (t_L < 500 Myr) average SFH slope is essential, as secular trends otherwise mimic burstiness in common diagnostics; (iii) frequent, intense bursts impose an outshining limit, and bias inference toward underestimating burstiness due to the obscuration of long-timescale power; and (iv) the power of SFR fluctuations can be inferred to 95% confidence across all timescales in both smooth and bursty populations. This framework establishes a novel and robust method for placing quantitative constraints on the feedback physics regulating star formation using large, uniformly selected spectroscopic samples."}

HWO will, for the first time, enable detailed studies of the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets through high-contrast reflection spectroscopy across the UV, optical, and near-infrared. These wavelength ranges provide access to key molecular absorption features, including O2, O3, H2O, CO2, and CH4, as well as potential surface biosignatures such as the vegetation red edge or ocean glint, making HWO a cornerstone mission for assessing planetary habitability.\n  Clouds are a dominant factor in determining planetary climate and observability, yet their properties remain highly degenerate when constrained using reflected flux alone. Spectropolarimetry, a measure of the polarisation state of reflected light as a function of wavelength and orbital phase, provides a powerful complementary diagnostic. Polarisation is highly sensitive to cloud particle size, composition, shape, vertical distribution, and surface type, enabling degeneracies between atmospheric and surface models to be broken. Numerous studies have demonstrated the value of polarimetry for characterising a wide range of exoplanets, from hot Jupiters to cooler potentially habitable worlds.\n  HWO's proposed instrument suite includes a coronagraph, a high-resolution imager, and a candidate high-resolution spectropolarimeter, offering multiple pathways to exploit polarimetry across diverse planetary regimes. This white paper argues that incorporating polarimetric capability into HWO instruments would significantly enhance the mission's scientific return. We highlight the unique opportunity for UK leadership in both instrument development and theoretical modelling, and advocate for a strong UK role in shaping HWO's polarimetric capabilities to maximise its impact on exoplanet science."}

The effect of internal properties and galaxy interactions on bar pattern speeds", "categories": ["astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "18 pages, 12 figures including appendices, submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "One of the main properties of galactic bars is their rotation (or pattern) speed, which is driven by both internal galactic properties, as well as external interactions. To assess the influence of these internal and external drivers on bar rotation in a cosmological setting, we use the Auriga suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations. We calculate the bar pattern speed and the bar rotation rate - the ratio of corotation radius to bar length - at the time of bar formation and at z=0, and compare these to bar age, bar strength, baryon dominance, galaxy stellar mass, and the history of external galaxy interactions. We find that galaxies which are more baryon dominated at z=0 - and which lie above the observed stellar mass-halo mass abundance matching relation - host faster bars, while more dark matter dominated galaxies host slower bars. Baryon-dominated galaxies also form their bars earlier and their rotation rates stay constant or even decrease over time; this leads to older bars being faster than their younger counterparts - in contrast to the expectation of bar slow-down from dynamical friction imparted by the dark matter halo. We also find a trend in stellar mass, with 'faster' bars being hosted in more massive galaxies, which could be driven by the underlying higher baryon-dominance of more massive galaxies. Furthermore, we find that external interactions, such as mergers and flybys, correlate with lower bar rotation rates, particularly for strong interactions that occur around bar formation time. This correlation is relatively weak, leaving internal baryon-dominance as the main driver of fast bar rotation rates."}

While the microphysical details may differ, as long as these sources are bounded in duration and correlation length, their tensor power spectra exhibit a universal scaling behavior at small wavenumber: $P_h(k) \\propto k^3$, corresponding to white noise on super-horizon scales at the time of production. If these early causal tensor sources (ECTs) exclusively produce gravitational waves before redshift $z \\sim 10^5$, this scaling is realized on all of the scales observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and thus yields a universal multipole distribution for the $B$-mode angular power spectrum. Unlike the scale-invariant distributions of inflationary $B$ modes, ECTs generically predict enhanced power on small scales and suppressed power on large scales, which allows these source classes to be distinguished given measurements over a sufficient range of angular scales. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for characterizing ECTs and demonstrate how their universal infrared scaling manifests in low-frequency observables, including CMB $B$ modes and stochastic gravitational wave spectral densities. We illustrate this mapping with representative case studies of this universality class involving first-order phase transitions, topological defects, and enhanced scalar perturbations, which source tensor modes at second order in perturbation theory."}

To investigate how Haro 11's properties arise, we perform a radiation hydrodynamics simulation of the merger, and create mock observations of LyC, Ly$α$, and H$α$, from which we compute their luminosities ($L$) and escape fractions ($f_{\\rm esc}$). We track these quantities along multiple sightlines as the two progenitor galaxies merge, from the first interaction until the system resembles present-day Haro 11. We find that $L$ and $f_{\\rm esc}$ vary by 1-2 orders of magnitude for LyC due to sightline variations. At the two pericentre passages, the total $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ increases by roughly an order of magnitude. Conversely, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm Lyα}$ shows a moderate increase at the pericentre passages, which affects the inference of LyC properties from Ly$α$. We attribute this to a displacement of the LyC-emitting stars relative to the \\Lya-emitting gas, combined with an increased density from gas compression. Furthermore, $f_{\\rm esc}^{\\rm LyC}$ is boosted during star formation bursts, likely due to stellar feedback. As direct comparison with Haro 11, the simulation qualitatively matches its morphology and luminosities. We find that among the dense stellar knots, knot C is the main contributor to both intrinsic and escaping LyC emission. Additionally, the Ly$α$ spectra displays distinct features found in observations, implying similar gas conditions are present."}

This particular form of EoS was first proposed by S. Saha and K. Bamba in 2019 and has two parameters, $θ_1$ and $θ_2$, which must be determined from observations. To this end, we place limits on these parameters by combining recent baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data -- including measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) -- with Type Ia supernova observations from the Pantheon+ compilation, along with direct determinations of the Hubble parameter. From this combined analysis, we obtain a best-fit value for the Hubble parameter, $H_0 = 67.4 \\pm 1.2~\\text{km\\,s}^{-1}\\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, while current measurements of the sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch yield $r_d = 146\\pm 2.5$~Mpc.

The model exhibits noticeable deviations from the predictions of the concordance $Λ$CDM model. Despite these differences, our results indicate that the model provides a coherent description of late-time cosmic evolution and the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe.

We found that all ETGs in the sample have formed more than about 30% of their stellar masses at z~5, up to ~100%. At z~5, the stellar masses of the most massive nearby ETGs, which have present-day stellar masses $\\log_{10}(M_{\\ast}/M_{\\odot})\\gtrsim 10.8$, are then found to be comparable to those of the red quiescent galaxies observed by JWST at similar redshifts (z>4.6). This study can be extended to ETGs in the 14000 deg$^2$ extragalactic sky that will soon be observed by Euclid, in combination with those from other major upcoming surveys (e.g. Rubin/LSST), and UV observations, to ultimately assess whether the nearby massive ETGs represent the progeny of the massive high-z JWST red quiescent galaxies."}

We aim to decompose the EBL into its principal constituents using multi-band intensity mapping combined with cosmic shear and galaxy clustering. We develop a joint halo-model framework in which IHL follows a mass- and redshift-dependent luminosity scaling, IGL is set by an evolving Schechter luminosity function, and EoR emission is modelled with Pop II/III stellar emissivities and a binned star-formation efficiency. Using mock surveys in a flat $Λ$CDM cosmology with ten spectral bands spanning 0.75-5.0$\\rm μm$ in the NEP deep fields over about 100$°^2$ with source detections down to AB=20.5 for masking, and six redshift bins to $z=2.5$, we fit auto- and cross-power spectra using a MCMC method.

Cross-correlations reveal a stronger coupling of IHL than IGL to the shear field, enhancing component separation; conversely, the EoR contribution shows negligible correlation with cosmic shear and galaxy clustering, aiding its isolation in the EBL. Relative to the SPHEREx EBL-only case, the inferred IHL fraction as a function of halo mass is significantly tightened over $10^{11}-10^{14} M_{\\odot}$, with uncertainties reduced by 5-30%, and the resulting star-formation rate density constraints extend to $z\\sim 11$, with uncertainty reductions of 22-31%."}

Villarroel and colleagues have assembled and analyzed datasets of unidentified features measured from digital scans of photographic plates captured by the first-epoch Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS1) in the pre-Sputnik era. These studies have called attention to (i) a purported deficit of features within Earth's shadow; (ii) the sporadic presence of linear clusters; and (iii) a positive correlation between the timing of feature observations and nuclear tests as well as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) sighting reports. These observations were cited as evidence that some fraction of the unidentified features represent glinting artificial objects near Earth. We have examined these claims using two related, previously published datasets. When analyzing the most vetted of these, we do not observe the reported deficit in the terrestrial shadow. We determine that a third of the features in the reported linear clusters were not confidently distinguished from catalog stars. We find that the reported correlation between the timing of feature observations and nuclear tests becomes insignificant after properly normalizing by the number of observation days, and is almost completely determined by the observation schedule of the Palomar telescope. We uncover important inconsistencies in the definitions of the datasets used in these studies, as well as the use of unvalidated datasets containing catalog stars, scan artifacts, and plate defects. It has not been shown that any of the features in these datasets represent optical transients. We examine the spatial distribution of the plate-derived features, finding an overall gradual increase in number density toward the corners and edges of plates, as well as examples of (i) empty north-south strips that span multiple plates; (ii) clusters and voids having geometric shapes; and (iii) amorphous clusters."}

We detected 620 anomalous NLSy1s classified into two groups i.e. 246, Red NLSy1s, exhibiting host galaxy dominated spectra with a low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) core revealed by the emission line widths. Another set of 374 Blue NLSy1s, strongly luminous galaxies with enhanced AGN activity, bluer continuum as compared to a typical NLSy1 and stronger Fe II emission. Finally, the third group of 257 outliers, identified as Intermediate Seyferts, a class of Seyfert galaxies identified by composite emission profiles, and extremely strong emission lines paired with virtually no continuum. These sources also exhibit rare and high ionization emission lines unseen in any other NLSy1 spectra (e.g. [Ne V]$\\lambda3345$, Ne V $\\lambda3426$, Ne III $\\lambda3869$ etc). We conclude that the differentiating factor between red and blue NLSy1s is not dust obscuration or orientation effect, but intrinsic distinction in AGN activity.

In such scenarios, however, a phantom-divide crossing, as recently suggested by DESI observations, is not achieved without encountering theoretical inconsistencies. We incorporate a canonical scalar field with a potential, in addition to the vector field, and show that the phantom-divide crossing from $w_{\\rm DE} < -1$ to $w_{\\rm DE} > -1$ can occur at low redshifts. We propose a minimal model that admits such a transition and identify the region of parameter space in which all dynamical degrees of freedom in the scalar, vector, and tensor sectors are free from ghost and Laplacian instabilities. We further investigate the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations by applying the quasi-static approximation to modes well inside the Hubble radius. The dimensionless quantities $μ$ and $Σ$, which characterize the growth of matter perturbations and the bending of light rays, respectively, depend on the sound speed $c_ψ$ of the longitudinal scalar perturbation associated with the vector field. Since $c_ψ$ is influenced by the transverse vector mode, the model exhibits sufficient flexibility to yield values of $μ$ and $Σ$ close to 1. Consequently, unlike theories such as scalar Galileons, the present model can be consistent with observations of redshift-space distortions and integrated Sachs-Wolfe-galaxy cross-correlations."}

In order to maximize the scientific return, we need a well thought strategy for selecting the observational targets, in our case exoplanets. This study evaluates various strategies for selecting exoplanet targets within limited observation windows, focusing specifically on the selection of exoplanet targets for Tier 2 transit spectroscopy with ESA's upcoming Ariel mission. We define three distinct selection criteria -- sample size, variance, and leverage -- and translate them into objective functions compatible with modern optimization algorithms. Specifically, we test five heuristics for maximizing sample leverage: leverage greedy, simulated annealing, K-means clustering, regular classes, and quantile classes. The performance of these methods is demonstrated through three practical exercises across one, two, and three parameters of diversity. Each criterion represents a unique trade-off between sample size, diversity, and total observation time. While a time-greedy approach maximizes the quantity of planets, it fails to capture diversity. Conversely, variance-greedy selection prioritizes diversity but introduces significant drawbacks: it oversamples rare cases and undersamples typical planets, ultimately reducing the total number of targets observed. Leverage-based selections emerge as the most effective middle ground, successfully balancing sample diversity with a robust sample size. This work supports the broader community effort to ensure that Ariel delivers the most diverse and scientifically valuable sample of exoplanet atmospheres within mission limits."}

We compare the colour profiles of galaxies with and without tidal features to extract information about the properties of the mergers that created these features. We find negative colour gradients for both galaxies with and without tidal features and find that tidal feature-hosting red sequence galaxies have redder outskirts than their non-tidal feature hosting counterparts, consistent with the outskirts of these galaxies being dominated by stars accreted from gas-poor minor mergers. We find decreasing mass ratios of tidal features-to-host galaxy with increasing galaxy stellar mass, suggesting that less massive galaxies undergo mergers with companions closer in mass than more massive galaxies. Galaxies exhibiting streams have bluer outskirts than those hosting shells, and shells around red sequence galaxies tend to be more massive and have higher mass ratios to their hosts than streams, consistent with streams being formed from mergers with satellites less massive than those responsible for shells. The agreement between our findings and those of other observational and simulation-based works confirms the validity of our methodology and highlights the value of tidal features colours as a probe into the process through which galaxies evolve."}

The resulting luminosity function is well described by a Schechter function with a characteristic magnitude $M^* = -21.30 \\pm 0.27$ and a faint-end slope $α= -1.23 \\pm 0.05$. This faint-end slope is consistent with those measured in the nearby Coma and Virgo clusters and in a cluster from the TNG50 cosmological simulation, and is slightly shallower than that of field galaxies. These findings indicate that the previously claimed steep faint-end upturn (with $α\\sim -2$) in nearby galaxy clusters is not supported.

We present a multi-modal deep learning framework that jointly leverages spatial and spectral information from CO observations to infer outflow mass, inclination, and position angle ($PA$). Our model, trained on synthetic ALMA observations generated from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, utilizes a cross-attention fusion mechanism to integrate morphological and kinematic features with probabilistic uncertainty estimation. Our results demonstrate that Vision Transformer architectures significantly outperform convolutional networks, showing remarkable robustness to reduced spatial resolution. Interpretability analysis reveals a physically consistent hierarchy: spatial features dominate across all parameters, whereas spectral profiles provide secondary constraints for mass and inclination. Applied to observational ALMA data, the framework delivers stable mass and $PA$ estimates with exceptionally tightly constrained inclination angles. This study establishes multi-modal deep learning as a powerful, interpretable tool for overcoming projection biases in high-mass star formation studies."}

The cross-correlation signal is measured as a function of the comoving separation $R$ between 2MASS galaxies and background FRB sightlines, making full use of the available redshift information for both datasets. Our measurements are consistent with a null detection over the range $0.01 < R\\, [h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}] < 1$.

This discrepancy indicates that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos with masses of $10^{12-13}\\, M_\\odot$ hosting 2MASS galaxies must be lower than that predicted by TNG300. A simple phenomenological modification of the TNG300 model suggests that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos of $10^{12-13}\\, M_\\odot$ should be below $\\sim 10\\%$ of the global baryon fraction in the nearby universe, implying the need for stronger feedback in this mass range. Our constraints are consistent with those inferred from X-ray emission and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements in galaxies, while providing a direct estimate of the hot-gas mass fraction that does not rely on electron-temperature measurements.

The VAE consists of an encoder network that maps high-dimensional EOS data into a lower-dimensional latent space and a decoder network that reconstructs the full EOS from the latent representation. The latent space includes supervised NS observables derived from the training EOS data, as well as latent random variables corresponding to additional unspecified EOS features learned automatically. Sampling the latent space enables the generation of new, causal, and stable EOS models that satisfy astronomical constraints on the supervised NS observables, while allowing Bayesian inference of the EOS incorporating additional multimessenger data, including gravitational waves from LIGO/Virgo and mass and radius measurements of pulsars. Based on a VAE trained on a Skyrme EOS dataset, we find that a latent space with two supervised NS observables, the maximum mass $(M_{\\max})$ and the canonical radius $(R_{1.4})$, together with one latent random variable controlling the EOS near the crust--core transition, can already reconstruct Skyrme EOSs with high fidelity, achieving mean absolute percentage errors of approximately $(0.15\\%)$ for $(M_{\\max})$ and $(R_{1.4})$ derived from the decoder-reconstructed EOS."}

In particular, the observed relation between the mass of the most massive star formed in an embedded cluster and the cluster's total stellar mass supports a deterministic sampling process, known as optimal sampling. However, the physical origin of optimal sampling has not been formally established in the literature. In this work, we show that the stellar mass distribution implied by optimal sampling emerges from applying the Maximum Entropy principle to the fragmentation of star-forming clumps, whose structure is set by density-dependent cooling in the optically thin regime. Here, the maximum entropy leads to unbiased distributions. By applying calculus of variations to minimize the entropy functional obtained assuming fragmentation, we recover the power-law form of the sIMF, and we show that any distribution deviating from the sIMF violates the Maximum Entropy principle. This work provides a first-principles foundation for the deterministic nature of star formation. Thus, the sIMF is the distribution resulting from a maximally unbiased system."}

While time-delay cosmography using quadruply lensed GW events associated with optical images of the lens systems can provide precise measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), they are considered to be much rarer than doubly lensed events. In this work, we analyze time-delay cosmography with doubly lensed GW events for the first time. We generate mock doubly lensed GW events with designed sensitivity of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O5 network, with LIGO post-O5 upgrade, and with Einstein Telescope (ET) + Cosmic Explorer (CE) respectively, and select the events that can be associated with future galaxy surveys. Over 1000 realizations, we find an average of 0.2(2.4) qualified events with the LVK O5(post-O5) network. Whereas with the ET+CE network, we find an average of 73.2 qualified events over 100 realizations. Using the Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) lens model, we jointly estimate waveform parameters and the impact parameter with doubly lensed GW signals, and then forecast the constraints on cosmological parameters and modified GW propagation by combining time-delay cosmography and the standard siren approach. The average posterior gives a constraint on $H_0$ with a relative uncertainty of $14\\%$, $10\\%$ and $0.42\\%$ in the $Λ$CDM model for the LVK O5, LVK post-O5, and ET+CE network, respectively.

By combining the fast constraints from the simple-pe algorithm with the nested sampling acceleration technique of posterior repartitioning, we demonstrate that our method can guide the nested sampler towards the most probable regions of parameter space more efficiently for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) greater than 20, while mathematically guaranteeing that the final inference is identical to that of a standard, uninformed analysis. We validate the method through an injection study, demonstrating that it produces statistically robust and unbiased results, whilst providing speedups of up to $2.2\\times$ for binaries with SNRs $< 150$.

The NSD is thought to be primarily fuelled by bar-driven gas inflows from the inner Galactic disc. As part of the LEGARE project, we construct the first chemical evolution models for the NSD using a Bayesian approach tailored to reproduce the observed metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) and compared with the available abundance ratios for Mg, Si, Ca relative to Fe. We adopt a state-of-the-art chemical evolution model in which the gas responsible for the formation of the NSD is assumed to be driven by the Galactic bar-induced inflows. The chemical composition of the accreted material is assumed to reflect that of the Galactic disc at a radius of 4 kpc. A Bayesian MCMC framework is used to fit the MDFs of different samples of NSD stars. If we take the NSD data at face value, without considering a possible contamination from bulge stars, we find that a formation scenario based on the inner disc flowing gas is inconsistent with the low metallicity tail of the observed MDF. This is because the inner disc metallicity, at the epoch of bar formation, was already near solar. On the other hand, models invoking dilution from additional metal-poor inflows successfully reproduce the observations. The best-fit model requires inflow metallicity 5 times lower than the inner disc and a moderate star formation efficiency. The same model successfully reproduces the observed [$α$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] ratios and predicts a star formation history consistent with the most recent estimates. However, if we assume that the MDF is contaminated by metal poor bulge stars and restricted to [Fe/H] > -0.3 dex, gas dilution is no longer required. In this case, the best-fit model has a very low star formation efficiency and a mild galactic wind."}

In this Letter we propose a new, purely geometric null test of the late-time expansion history that is exactly independent of the Hubble constant. By combining strong-lensing time-delay distances with gravitational-wave standard-siren luminosity distances, we construct a dimensionless ratio that depends only on the redshift dependence of the expansion rate and can be both predicted from early-Universe data and measured directly at late times, without relying on the cosmic distance ladder or the sound horizon. We show that the comparison between the early- and late-time determinations of this ratio provides a transparent consistency test of the standard cosmological expansion. When combined with an independent standard-siren measurement of $H_{0}$, this framework allows one to unambiguously distinguish between early- and late-time origins of the Hubble tension. With the forthcoming detection of lensed gravitational-wave standard sirens, the proposed test provides a timely and robust framework for probing this long-standing cosmological puzzle."}

We demonstrate this framework on a simulated case study with machine learning based transit spectroscopy retrievals of exoplanet WASP-107b. Characterising many exoplanet atmospheres can answer important questions about planetary populations, but traditional retrievals are very resource intensive; machine learning based methods offer a fast alternative however (i) they require high volumes data (only obtainable through simulations) to train and (ii) their complexity renders them black-boxes. Better understanding how they reach predictions can allow us to inspect for biases, which is especially important with simulated data, and verify that predictions are made on the basis of physically plausible features. This ultimately improves the ease of adoption of machine learning techniques. The most used methods to explain machine learning model predictions (such as SHAP and other methods that rely on stochastic sample generation) suffer from high computational complexity and struggle to account for interactions between inputs. PERTURB-c addresses these issues by leveraging physical knowledge of the known spectral correlation. For visualisation of this analysis, we propose a heat-map-based representation which is better suited to large numbers of input features along a single dimension, and that is more intuitive to those who are already familiar with retrieval methods. Note that while we chose this exoplanet retrieval context to demonstrate our methodologies, the PERTURB-c framework is model agnostic and in a broader context has potential value across a plethora of adjacent regression problems."}

Our model, trained on synthetic ALMA observations generated from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, utilizes a cross-attention fusion mechanism to integrate morphological and kinematic features with probabilistic uncertainty estimation. Our results demonstrate that Vision Transformer architectures significantly outperform convolutional networks, showing remarkable robustness to reduced spatial resolution. Interpretability analysis reveals a physically consistent hierarchy: spatial features dominate across all parameters, whereas spectral profiles provide secondary constraints for mass and inclination. Applied to observational ALMA data, the framework delivers stable mass and $PA$ estimates with exceptionally tightly constrained inclination angles. This study establishes multi-modal deep learning as a powerful, interpretable tool for overcoming projection biases in high-mass star formation studies."}

Operating in the ultra-low-frequency gravitational band inaccessible from Earth, LILA is sensitive to scalar metric perturbations sourced by dark energy dynamics. Using both fluid and effective field theory descriptions, we develop a complete framework linking dark energy sound speed to observable strain signatures. We construct a likelihood pipeline and Fisher forecasts, showing that LILA can either detect clustering dark energy or exclude broad classes of models with unprecedented sensitivity. This establishes lunar interferometry as a novel and powerful probe of the physics driving cosmic acceleration."}

Radiative transfer is solved using the Monte Carlo approach in 3-D regardless of the input hydrodynamical model's dimension. The velocity field at any given point is interpolated using the trilinear interpolation. The optical depth is then integrated numerically along the photon's path.\n  We verified the accuracy of the numerical velocity interpolation by comparison with results obtained for analytical velocity fields, achieving successful outcomes.

So far, the most direct evidence for BH*s comes from a handful of sources where the host galaxy is completely outshone as suggested by their remarkably steep Balmer breaks. Here we present a novel scheme to disentangle BH*s from their host galaxies assuming that the [OIII]5008Å line arises exclusively from the host. Using a sample of 98 LRDs ($z$~$2-9$) with high quality NIRSpec/PRISM spectra, we demonstrate that the host-subtracted median stack displays a Balmer break $>2\\times$ stronger than massive quiescent galaxies, with the rest-optical continuum resembling a blackbody-like SED ($T_{\\rm{eff}}$~$4050$ K, $\\log(L_{\\rm{bol}})$~$43.9$ erg s$^{-1}$, $R_{\\rm{eff}}$~$1300$ au). We measure a steep Balmer decrement (H$α$/H$β>10$) and numerous density-sensitive features (e.g., FeII, HeI, OI). These are hallmark signatures of dense gas envelopes, providing population-level evidence that BH*s indeed power LRDs.

Identifying such lensed pairs, however, remains challenging due to the computational cost and/or the reliance on prior knowledge of source parameters in existing methods. This study investigates a novel approach, Optimal Cross-Correlation Analysis for Multiplets (OCCAM), applied to strain data from one or more detectors for Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) events identified by GW searches, using an optimal, mildly model-dependent, low computation cost approach to identify strongly lensed candidates. This technique efficiently narrows the search space, allowing for more sensitive, but (much) higher latency, algorithms to refine the results further. We demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than other computationally inexpensive methods. In particular, we achieve 97 percent (80 percent) lensed event detection at a pairwise false positive probability of approximately 13 percent (7 percent) for a single detector with LIGO design sensitivity, assuming an SNR greater than or equal to 10 astrophysically motivated lensed and unlensed populations. Thus, this method, using a network of detectors and in conjunction with sky-localisation information, can enormously reduce the false positive probability, making it highly viable to efficiently and quickly search for lensing pairs among thousands of events, including the sub-threshold candidates."}

Recent research indicates a noticeable decline in the rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way (MW), suggesting the need for a new low-mass model to describe its dynamical features. This study constructs a new Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger model to characterize the RC features of our galaxy. We use the GIZMO code to simulate mergers with various orbital parameters to investigate how the disk warp evolves under different conditions. This simulation demonstrates the evolutionary mechanism of disk warp, which arises due to the asymmetric gravitational potential of the dark matter (DM) halo generated universally by galaxy mergers. The results indicate that the tilt angle of the DM halo partly reflects the gravitational strength at the $Z=0$ plane, while the gravitational strength on the disk plane reflects the amplitude of disk warp. We identify a dual-regime interaction mechanism driven by the asymmetric halo potential. On short timescales, we find a distinct anti-correlation between the halo's tilt angle and the disk's warp amplitude, indicating a `seesaw' mechanism of angular momentum exchange. On secular timescales, however, dynamical friction drives a global alignment, causing both the halo tilt and the warp amplitude to decay simultaneously. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high-inclination mergers can sustain long-lived prograde precession, where the persistent yet decaying gravitational torque maintains the prograde bending mode against differential wind-up."}

Pulsar scintillometry has proven to be a powerful technique, revealing rich and unexpected scattering phenomenology in the ISM and also shedding light on the emission physics of pulsars. FRB scintillometry stands to be a similarly powerful probe of FRB emission, as well as structure on tiny scales in ionized media beyond our galaxy, such as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). However, nascent FRB scintillation studies are far from the sophisticated lensing geometry reconstructions that have been performed for scintillating pulsars. In this paper, we introduce a novel theoretical framework for scintillometry, demonstrating that the full astrometric content of scintillation observations is contained within a single underlying observable: the instantaneous spatial wavefield. We relate the instantaneous spatial wavefield to more familiar concepts from the pulsar scintillometry literature, such as the dynamic spectrum. Using this framework, we discuss prospects and limitations for FRB scintillometry, towards the goal of full astrometric reconstructions of FRB lensing geometries.

Focusing on the ULDM Jeans scale, we identify the critical conditions under which high-redshift baryonic gas, strongly confined by central solitonic cores of the halos, undergoes direct and monolithic collapse. The solitonic potential naturally drives rapid inflow and shock heating, allowing the gas to exceed the critical atomic-cooling and fragmentation-suppression threshold of $\\sim 3 \\times 10^4 {\\rm K}$ without invoking an external UV background. We derive semi-analytic relations for the halo mass, soliton mass, baryonic core radius, and thermodynamic state of the gas, including the effects of baryonic contraction. These relations simultaneously determine the minimum and maximum SMBH seed masses as functions of redshift. In this framework, pristine gas clouds that satisfy the temperature threshold collapse without fragmentation, forming SMBH seeds with characteristic masses of order $\\sim 10^5M_\\odot$, while systems below the threshold are expected to form compact star clusters instead. Our model also implies an upper limit on the attainable SMBH mass, predicting a maximum mass scale of order $\\sim10^{10}M_\\odot$, consistent with the most massive quasars observed to date. The ULDM particle mass required to reproduce the inferred seed mass scale, $m \\simeq 10^{-22}{\\rm eV}$, coincides with the value favored by galactic-scale observations, providing a unified explanation for the characteristic masses of both galactic cores and early SMBH seeds. Our model predicts efficient SMBH seed formation at redshifts $z \\gtrsim 10$ and offers a natural interpretation of recently observed little red dots as SMBHs embedded in compact, hot, ionized gas clouds."}

As we demonstrate in a very detailed manner, this is impossible for a canonical and minimally coupled single scalar field theory, but it may be possible for ghost condensate theories like $k$-essence theories. We point out how the ghost instabilities may be eliminated, and we analyze the quantitative features of a $k$-essence theory that may realize a phantom-to-quintessence transition in the late Universe.

In this article we study a combined framework of a tachyonic minimally coupled single scalar field theory in the presence of an $\\mathcal{R}^2$ correction term and with a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term of the form $\\sim λ\\frac{\\mathcal{R}}{16πG}$. Such terms can be part of an $f(\\mathcal{R})$ gravity which in the large curvature regime yields such correction terms effectively. Alternatively, such terms can simply be quantum corrections to the scalar field action. We aim to answer two questions, firstly if this framework can lead to phantom divide line transitions and secondly whether the resulting model can be compatible with the ACT data. The model we studied is an inverse square power-law model, well known from tachyon inflation models. As we show, the field equations can be cast in terms of the scalar field solely, however the resulting theory is distinct from a single scalar field theory, because the phantom divide line is crossed during inflation. Thus initially the tachyonic nature of the scalar field generates a phantom equation of state parameter, and during inflation the phantom divide line is crossed, with the effective equation of state parameter at the end of inflation being $w=-1/3$ which corresponds to the non-accelerating state of the Universe. The model is proved to be compatible with the ACT data, only when the gravity during inflation is stronger than Einstein-Hilbert gravity, with the effective gravitational constant during inflation being $\\frac{G}λ$. The effective theory is valid only during inflation, thus Big-Bang nucleosynthesis is not affected by the rescaling of the Einstein-Hilbert gravity.

The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will deliver multi-band light curves for millions of AGN, enabling variability studies at a true population scale. We synthesize recent results from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which demonstrate that optical variability amplitudes and timescales are primarily regulated by accretion state, with secondary dependence on black hole mass and redshift, and establish the feasibility of survey-driven continuum reverberation mapping. ZTF measurements reveal optical continuum-emitting region sizes that often exceed standard thin disk predictions, implicating diffuse continuum emission from the broad line region as a significant contributor to observed inter-band lags. We evaluate the implications of LSST cadence and survey strategy, particularly the deep drilling fields, for continuum and emission line reverberation mapping, changing-look AGN, extreme variability quasars, and periodic variability searches. Key limitations of broadband photometric variability are identified, including variable emission line contamination, diffuse BLR continuum emission, and cadence-dependent lag recoverability. We argue that realizing LSST's full scientific potential requires community-scale, standardized variability metric pipelines, probabilistic classification integrated with alert brokers for follow-up triggering, and complementary medium-band photometric observations to isolate the accretion disk continuum. Together, these elements will enable LSST to convert photometric variability into quantitative constraints on accretion disks, BLR structure, and supermassive black hole growth across cosmic time."}

Submitted", "summary": "One of the major discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the identification of a large population of luminous galaxies at $z>10$, challenging theoretical models for early galaxy formation. The unexpectedly high number density of these systems has triggered intense debate about potential differences in the physical properties of galaxies at such extreme redshifts and those at lower redshift. However, progress has been limited by the lack of rest-frame optical diagnostics, which are critical for constraining the key properties. Here we present deep JWST/MIRI observations of a UV-luminous galaxy at $z=11.04$, CEERS2-588, only 400 Myr after the Big Bang. CEERS2-588 is detected in the MIRI F560W and F770W bands, while deep MIRI/MRS spectroscopy yields no detection of H$α$ or [OIII]$\\lambda5007$ line, revealing a prominent Balmer break detected for the first time at $z>10$. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting indicates an extended star formation history possibly reaching $z>15$, followed by rapid quenching within the recent $\\sim10$ Myr, in stark contrast to other $z>10$ galaxies. The MIRI detections also significantly improve our stellar mass estimate to $\\mathrm{log}(M_*/M_\\odot)=9.1^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$, making CEERS2-588 the most massive galaxy securely confirmed at $z>10$. Remarkably, the inferred gas-phase metallicity is near solar, exceeding predictions from current theoretical models. These results suggest that efficient starbursts play a key role in producing the abundant luminous galaxy population in the early universe."}

We aim to investigate the orbital structure of the unusually large NSC in FCC 47 (NGC 1336) by decomposing its stellar orbits into dynamically distinct components. We extract stellar kinematics, and in particular the line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs), from VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy using the non-parametric Bayes-LOSVD approach, and apply triaxial Schwarzschild orbit-superposition modelling with the DYNAMITE software. We decompose the orbit library into hot, warm, cold, and counter-rotating components. We detect triple-peaked LOSVDs in the nucleus, indicating a complex orbital structure. The NSC forms a counter-rotating, kinematically decoupled component. A hot pressure-supported component, a warm counter-rotating structure and a counter-rotating cold disk in the centre suggest hierarchical assembly via early star cluster accretion and later in situ star formation. Our orbital decomposition of FCC 47 supports a hybrid formation scenario for this NSC.

These are the so called bulk flows, the presence of which has come to be treated as a problem for the $Λ$CDM paradigm. However, the limits of the $Λ$CDM model are based on Newtonian studies, which predict the mediocre $v\\propto t^{1/3}$ growth-rate for the peculiar-velocity field ($v$). Recently, a few fully relativistic treatments have appeared in the literature, arguing for a much stronger velocity growth that could explain the reported fast and deep bulk flows. What separates the Newtonian from the relativistic studies is the gravitational input of the peculiar flux, namely of the kinetic energy triggered by the moving matter. The latter has no direct gravitational contribution in Newtonian theory, but it does so in general relativity. This drastically changes the driving agent of the peculiar-velocity field and boosts its linear growth. The aim of this work is to directly compare the two treatments, as well as identify and discuss the reasons for their different results. In the process, we also demonstrate how one could recover the relativistic growth-rate from a Newtonian setup by selectively including certain (typically ignored) source-free terms into the Poisson equation. This way, we provide a unified covariant comparison of the Newtonian, the quasi-Newtonian and the fully relativistic studies."}

To separate these three cases, we evaluate two commonly used PBH-formation criteria: the time scale ratio $t_\\mathrm{H}/t_\\mathrm{V}$ (horizon crossing time versus vacuum-energy domination time) and the local density contrast $δ(t_\\mathrm{H})$ at horizon crossing.

Multiple physical mechanisms can contribute to the spectrum at these frequencies, including relativistic jets, the jet base, outflows, star formation, and synchrotron emission from the hot corona. Recently, new extreme radio variability has been observed in the class of low-mass/high-Eddington AGN known as narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies, suggesting that another, more exotic mechanism may also play a role, especially at frequencies above 10 GHz. To investigate this relatively unexplored area of the radio spectrum, we observed a sample of 50 NLS1s with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and 20 of them were observed twice. In this sample, 24 sources were not detected, while the others are typically characterized by a steep spectrum that can be modeled with a power law. We also identified two new candidate jetted NLS1s, including a high-frequency peaker, which is an extremely young relativistic jet. We found no significant variability in the sources observed twice. We conclude that the radio spectrum of NLS1s is typically dominated by optically thin emission, likely from low-power outflows, or by circumnuclear star formation, with a limited contribution from relativistic jets. Further studies at different spatial scales and at other wavelengths are necessary to fully constrain the origin of the radio emission in this class of active galaxies."}

By coupling this architecture to the differential formulation of the Loeb Scale, ISO classification and risk assessment become predictive rather than reactive. This framework transforms ISO astronomy into a mature, scalable discipline capable of maximizing scientific return and informing planetary defense in the coming decades."}

Submitted to AJ", "summary": "Extremely metal-poor stars are intrinsically rare, but emerging methods exist to accurately classify them from all-sky Gaia XP low-resolution spectra. To assess their overall accuracy for targeting metal-poor stars, we present a high-resolution spectroscopic followup of 75 very metal-poor candidates selected from the catalog by R. Andrae, V. Chandra, and H. W. Rix. We discover 2 new extremely metal-poor ($\\rm{[Fe / H]}<-3$) stars and 20 new very metal-poor ($\\rm{[Fe/H]} < -2$) stars. Abundances of up to 22 elements are derived from 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis and kinematic parameters are derived using Gaia astrometry and spectroscopic radial velocities. The chemodynamical properties are mostly consistent with expectations for halo stars, but we discover an Mg-enhanced CEMP star ($\\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]} = 0.89$) and an Mg-poor star from an accreted ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. The Gaia XP metallicity estimates are consistent with our $\\rm{[Fe/H]}$ measurements down to $\\rm{[Fe/H]}\\sim -3.0$, but estimates worsen in highly extincted regions. We find that 4 other XP-based metallicity catalogs succeed in mitigating contaminants and can also classify metal-poor stars robustly to $\\rm{[Fe/H]}\\sim -3.0$. Our results demonstrate the utility of Gaia XP spectra for identifying the most metal-poor stars across the Galaxy."}

Considering two plausible scenarios, AGN jets and winds, we model the X-ray, GeV, and TeV emission during both TeV-low (quasi-quiet) and TeV-high (active) states. The spectral energy distributions can be explained either by single-zone leptonic emission from moderately relativistic jets or by lepto-hadronic emission from sub-relativistic winds. The best-fit parameters suggest that the transition from the quasi-quiet to the active state may be driven jointly by an enhanced accretion rate and the expansion of jets or winds. We further show that future MeV and very-high-energy $γ$-ray observations can discriminate between the {leptonic and lepto-hadronic scenarios}. Although the neutrino flux from NGC~1068 predicted by the wind model is too low to be detected with current neutrino observatories, a lepto-hadronic wind scenario can account for the PeV diffuse neutrino background when adopting a local LLAGN density corrected for the TeV duty cycle, $n_{\\rm L,0}(ΔT_{\\rm TeV}/T) \\sim 10^{-5}~\\rm Mpc^{-3}$, as inferred from the LHAASO detection."}

All the stars were observed with the FLAMES high-resolution multi-object spectrograph mounted at the VLT. Our analysis confirmed the presence of a large metallicity range in M 54, with the majority of the stars having -1.8 < [Fe/H] < -1.0 dex and few stars with [Fe/H] > -1.0 dex. The mean value of the total sample is [Fe/H] = -1.40 (σ = 0.22 dex). A Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis revealed that the observed spread in [Fe/H] is compatible with a non-null intrinsic iron dispersion. We also found that the metallicity distribution function and the broadening of the red giant branch of M 54 are not compatible with a single age, but instead they suggest a wide age range from ~ 13 Gyr to ~ 1 - 2 Gyr or a smaller age range if a significant He enhancement (Y ~ 0.35/0.40) is present in the most metal-rich stars. We identified among the stars in M 54 the entire pattern of anticorrelations linked to the MgAl burning cycle. In particular, the metal-rich component displays a higher level of H-burning with the presence of more extended anticorrelations than the metal-poor component. No Mg-poor ([Mg/Fe]<0.0 dex) stars are identified in M 54. The evidence collected so far cannot be explained neither with a globular cluster-like scenario nor with a galactic chemical evolution. The chemical properties of M 54 can be explained within a scenario where this system formed through the merging of two globular clusters, the metal-poor one with standard characteristics and the more metal-rich one with more pronounced chemical anomalies, a possibly younger than the first one. M 54 is confirmed as a key stellar system for explaining the chemical evolution of a nuclear star cluster."}

The product of the V-band geometric albedo, $p_V$, with the physical cross-section of the nucleus is $0.22 \\pm 0.07$ km$^{2}$, which corresponds to an effective radius of $1.3 \\pm 0.2$ km if assuming $p_{V} = 0.04$, as is typical for cometary nuclei in the solar system. This size is in agreement with our estimate derived from the reported nongravitational effect and activity of the interstellar object. If the measured photometric variations are solely due to the rotation of an aspherical nucleus, the axis ratio must be $2:1$ or greater, and the rotation period $\\gtrsim\\!1$ hr. Leveraging the range of covered phase angles, we identified a significant opposition surge of $\\sim\\!0.2$ mag with a width of $3^\\circ \\pm 1^\\circ$, which may include concurrent contributions from orbital plane crossing and tail projection, and determined a linear phase slope of $0.026 \\pm 0.006$ mag degree$^{-1}$ for the coma dust. Compared to the preperihelion brightening trend, 3I faded more rapidly on the outbound leg, following an activity index of $4.5 \\pm 0.3$, not unusual in the context of solar system comets. This activity asymmetry is further corroborated by a postperihelion coma surface brightness profile that is significantly shallower than its preperihelion counterpart. From the statistics, we infer that multiple interstellar objects resembling 3I likely went undetected even before the discovery of 1I/`Oumuamua."}

We extend our previous analysis of Gaia XP spectra of hot subdwarf stars to a much larger sample, enabling a comprehensive study of their physical and binary properties. Our goal is to identify patterns in Gaia XP spectra, investigate binarity, and assess the influence of parameters such as temperature, helium abundance, and variability. We analyse approximately 20000 hot subdwarf candidates selected from the literature, combining Gaia XP data with published parameters. We apply Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to the XP coefficients, which represent the Gaia XP spectra in a compact, feature-based form, to construct a similarity map. We then use self-organizing maps (SOMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify spectra as binaries or singles, and as cool and helium-poor or hot and helium-rich. The spectra are normalised using asymmetric least squares baseline fitting to emphasise individual spectral features. The BP-RP colour dominates the similarity map, with additional influence from temperature, helium abundance, and variability. Most binaries, identified via the Virtual Observatory SED Analyser (VOSA), cluster in two filaments linked to main sequence companions. CNN classification suggests a strong correlation between variability and binarity, with binary fractions exceeding 60 percent for active hot subdwarfs. Gaia XP spectra combined with dimensionality reduction and machine learning effectively reveal patterns in hot subdwarf properties. Our findings indicate that binarity and environmental density strongly shape the evolutionary paths of hot subdwarfs, and we identify possible contamination by main sequence and cataclysmic variable stars in the base sample."}

Submitted to ApJL", "summary": "We present the first spectroscopic characterization of an interstellar object at mid-infrared wavelengths. Post-perihelion observations of 3I/ATLAS using the JWST/MIRI medium-resolution spectrometer were obtained on 2025 December 15--16 and 27 when the object was at heliocentric distances of 2.20 and 2.54 au, respectively. Our 5--28 micron spectra exhibit fluorescence features from several gaseous species, including the $ν_2$ band of water at 5.8--7.0 microns. the primary $ν_2$ and associated hot bands of carbon dioxide around 15 microns, and a forbidden transition of atomic nickel at 7.507 microns. We also report the first direct detection of methane in an interstellar object. The delayed onset of methane production relative to water suggests past depletion from the outermost layers, with the observed methane emerging from unprocessed subsurface material. Comparison of the volatile production rates measured during the two epochs indicate a significant reduction in overall outgassing over 12 days, with the measured water activity level dropping more steeply than other species. As shown through near-nucleus coma mapping, 3I continues to display an extended source of water production from icy grains entrained within the coma. Our production rate measurements confirm that 3I exhibits a strongly enhanced CO$_2$:H$_2$O mixing ratio relative to typical solar system comets, as well as a somewhat enriched CH$_4$:H$_2$O value."}

Recently, Niu et al. (2026) analyzed a 39-year baseline of times of maximum light of BE Lyn, reporting that it is the most eccentric binary known ($e \\approx 0.9989$) and hosts the nearest black hole (BH) known to date. We analyze Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry of BE Lyn, predicting what the observed proper motion anomaly (PMA) over the 25 year baseline between the two missions would be were the companion really a $\\gtrsim 17.5\\,M_{\\odot}$ BH. We find that the predicted PMA is at least an order of magnitude larger than the observed value of $\\approx 1.7 \\pm 0.8$ mas yr$^{-1}$, regardless of the assumed orientation of the orbit. We predict the expected Gaia DR3 RUWE for different orientations of the putative BH binary, finding that it ranges from $\\approx 2.5$-$4.0$, much larger than the reported value of $1.073$. The observed value is instead consistent with a low-mass secondary or a single star. We find that BE Lyncis would have received a 7-parameter acceleration solution if it were a BH binary, in contradiction with its absence from the Gaia DR3 non-single star catalogs. Finally, we show that the reported orbit is impossible because the luminous star would overflow its Roche lobe at periastron, irrespective of inclination. We recommend caution in interpreting light-travel time effect (LTTE) models that require very high eccentricities, face-on inclinations, or large companion masses. The observed pulsation timing variations are most likely simply a result of red noise or pulsation phase evolution."}
