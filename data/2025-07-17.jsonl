Ionizing photons are primarily\nproduced by stars, which shape the morphology of ionized regions and drive\nreionization. Given the restrictive black hole growth in the original\nIllustrisTNG model, we reduce the radiative efficiency from 0.2 to 0.1,\nresulting in higher accretion rates for massive black holes, more bursty\ngrowth, and earlier AGN-driven quenching.

Using VLT/UVES\nand HST/COS quasar spectra, we analyse MgI, MgII, HI, CII, CIII, and OVI\nabsorption relative to galaxy rotation curves from Keck/LRIS and Magellan/MagE\nspectra. We find that at lower $D/R_{vir}$ ($D/R_{vir}\\leq 0.2$), over 80% of\nabsorption in all ions lies on the side of systemic velocity matching disk\nrotation, and the optical-depth-weighted median velocity ($v_{abs}$) is\nconsistent with the peak rotation speed. At higher $D/R_{vir}$ ($D/R_{vir} >\n0.2$), the kinematics diverge by ionisation state: For low ionisation gas, the\namount of co-rotating absorption remains >80%, yet $v_{abs}$ drops to 60% of\nthe galaxy rotation speed. For high ionisation gas (OVI), only 60% of the\nabsorption is consistent with co-rotation and $v_{abs}$ drops to 20% of the\nrotation speed. Furthermore, the velocity widths, corresponding to 50% of the\ntotal optical depth ($\\Delta v_{50}$) for low ionisation gas is 1.8 times\nlarger in the inner halo than at larger radii, while for CIII and OVI $\\Delta\nv_{50}$ remains unchanged with distance. These results suggest a radially\ndependent CGM kinematic structure: the inner halo hosts cool, dynamically broad\ngas tightly coupled to disk rotation, whereas beyond 0.2$R_{vir}$, particularly\ntraced by OVI and HI, the CGM shows weaker rotational alignment and lower\nvelocity dispersion. Therefore, low-ionisation gas likely traces extended\nco-rotating gas, inflows and/or recycled accretion, while high-ionisation gas\nreflects a mixture of co-rotating, lagging, discrete collisionally ionised\nstructures, indicating a kinematic stratification of the multi-phase CGM.\n[Abridged]"}

This sample spans a wide\nrange of galaxy properties, with robust determinations of nitrogen and oxygen\nabundances via the direct-$T_{\\rm e}$ method. We explore how N/O relates to\ndensity structure, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), stellar age,\ncompactness, and gas kinematics. In addition, we compare our results with those\nof galaxies at $z =2-10$ where N/O ratios were derived from optical or UV\nnitrogen lines, aiming to identify chemical enrichment pathways across cosmic\ntime. Our analysis shows that the N/O-O/H relation in CLASSY galaxies aligns\nwith the trends seen in local galaxies and extragalactic HII regions, and that\ngalaxies at $z = 2-6$ exhibit similar N/O values, indicating no significant\nredshift evolution in N/O. We identify a significant correlation between\nelectron density $n_{\\rm e}$([S II]) and N/O, suggesting that density structure\ncontributes to the scatter in the N/O-O/H relation. The CLASSY galaxies with\nhigh SFRs or compact star formation show elevated N/O, though no strong\ncorrelation with stellar mass is found. We also find that high-velocity\noutflows (v$_{out}$ > 350 km/s) and low mass-loading factors are linked to\nelevated N/O, indicating that feedback plays a significant role.

Mock galaxy catalogues were obtained by\npopulating haloes with galaxies using an halo occupation distribution (HOD)\nmodel extracted from the Flagship galaxy catalogue provided by Euclid\nCollaboration. The Geppetto set of 3500 simulated skies was obtained by tiling\na 1.2 Gpc/h box to cover a light-cone whose sky footprint is a circle of 30 deg\nradius, for an area of 2763 deg$^2$ and a minimum halo mass of\n$1.5\\times10^{11}$ Msun/h.

The EuclidLargeBox set consists of 1000\nsimulations of 3.38 Gpc/h, with the same mass resolution and a footprint that\ncovers half of the sky, excluding the Milky Way zone of avoidance. From this we\nproduced a set of 1000 EuclidLargeMocks on the 30 deg radius footprint, whose\ncomoving volume is fully contained in the simulation box. We validated the two\nsets of catalogues by analysing number densities, power spectra, and 2-point\ncorrelation functions, showing that the Flagship spectroscopic catalogue is\nconsistent with being one of the realisations of the simulated sets, although\nwe noticed small deviations limited to the quadrupole at k>0.2 h/Mpc. We show\ncosmological parameter inference from these catalogues and demonstrate that\nusing one realisation of EuclidLargeMocks in place of the Flagship mock\nproduces the same posteriors, to within the expected shift given by sample\nvariance. These simulated skies will be used for the galaxy clustering analysis\nof Euclid's Data Release 1 (DR1)."}

However, while observations\nubiquitously detect O VI absorption around low-redshift, $\\sim L^*$\nstar-forming galaxies, the relationship between O VI and the galaxy disk,\nespecially the kinematics, is not well-established. This work focuses on the O\nVI kinematics and its comparison with that of the low ions and galactic disk\nrotation. We present observations of 18 pairs of quasars and $z\\approx0.2$\nstar-forming galaxies. All quasar sightlines intersect the circumgalactic\nmedium (CGM) within 45$^\\circ$ from the galaxy major axes. We show that while\nindividual O VI velocity components do not correlate with disk rotation, the\nbulk of O VI gas in individual sightlines rarely counter-rotates. We then match\nO VI velocity components with those of low ions by minimizing the difference of\ntheir velocity centroids. The O VI velocity components with successful low-ion\nmatches are typically found at small sightline impact parameters and are more\nlikely to corotate with the disk. We suggest that the low-ion-matched O VI\nvelocity components trace the gas co-spatial with the low ions near the\nextended disk plane in the inner CGM, whereas those without low-ion matches\nrepresent the gas at large 3D radii. While the gas at large radii is\ntheoretically expected to kinematically correlate with the disk angular\nmomentum, this correlation is expected to be weaker due to the higher turbulent\nto mean rotation velocity ration at large radii, consistent with our results."}

When the mass of NSC inside the\norbit is smaller than $M_{s}$ dynamical friction becomes inefficient. The\nsubsequent orbital evolution of SBBH is largely governed by perturbing tidal\npotential of NSC arising from its non-sphericity. When the perturbing potential\nis mainly determined by quadrupole harmonics with azimuthal number $|m|=2$ the\nsecular dynamics of the SBBH does not conserve any components of the angular\nmomentum and can lead to the formation of highly eccentric orbits. Such orbits\ncan experience an efficient circularization due to emission of gravitational\nwaves (GW). In this Paper we consider this situation in some detail. We study\nanalytically and numerically the orbital evolution taking into account the\nimportant effect of Einstein apsidal precession and estimate the largest\npossible value of $e$, which can be obtained. We then estimate a possibility of\nfast orbital circularization through emission of gravitation waves on a highly\neccentric orbit, with circularization timescale of the order of the orbital\nperiod. We find that our mechanism could result in such events on a time scale\nof the order of or smaller than a few Gyr. It is stressed that for particular\nvalues of the model parameters such events may sometimes be distinguished from\nthe ones expected in more standard scenarios, since in our case the\neccentricity may remain substantial all the way down to the final merger. It is\nalso noted that our results can be applied to other astrophysical settings,\ne.g. to study the orbital evolution of a binary star or a proto planetary\nsystem inside a massive deformed gas cloud."}

We demonstrate its science capabilities with a number of example\nuse cases across scales: (i) Lyman-alpha RT on simple shell-like gas\ndistributions; (ii) Lyman-alpha RT applied to a high-resolution, high-redshift\n$z \\sim 6$ cosmological hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulation; (iii)\nLyman-alpha and Magnesium-II halos, i.e. scattering and emission from the\ncircumgalactic medium of $z \\simeq 1-2$ galaxies drawn from cosmological\nmagnetohydrodynamical simulations; (iv) the large-scale cosmic web in gas\nemission, a $6144^3$ volume-element RT scaling calculation; and (v) synthetic\nabsorption spectra of the Lyman-alpha forest. Extensive verification and\nbenchmarking validates our approach and its computational efficiency."}

However, its full\ncosmological implications remain unexplored. In this work, we perform a\ncomprehensive analysis of the dynamical properties of the GSU2P theory in a\nflat, homogeneous, and isotropic spacetime, through a dynamical-system\napproach. Our analysis reveals the presence of three pairs of fixed points, one\nof them corresponding to de-Sitter expansion which may represent either a\nstable or unstable phase in the evolution of the universe. These points,\nnonetheless, give rise to an indeterminate or infinite Hubble parameter, which\nrenders them cosmologically unviable. Additionally, we find two key\npseudostationary states: the ``attractor lines'', along which the system\nexhibits constant-roll dynamics, and the ``central zone'', characterized by\noscillatory radiation-like behaviour of the field. The dynamics within the\ncentral zone could represent a graceful exit from the primordial inflationary\nphase to a radiation dominated phase, or a state of the dark energy component\nprior to the late-time cosmic acceleration. However, within the central zone,\nthe dynamics of the vector field leads to recurrent instances of a nonphysical\nexpansion rate. The absence of a limit cycle in the central zone further\nexacerbates the issue, as the system may follow unbounded phase-space\ntrajectories, and the expansion rate becomes complex once it escapes the\nregion. Collectively, these challenges undermine the viability of the GSU2P\ntheory as a cosmological model for cosmic acceleration."}

We aim to identify the dominant heating mechanisms of the cold dust in\ntypical nearby spiral galaxies and explore the contributions of young and\nevolved stars to dust heating.\n  Methods. Using 18 large, face-on spiral galaxies from the DustPedia project,\nwe apply two complementary approaches: (1) correlation analysis between dust\ntemperature (T_dust), SFR surface density (Sigma_SFR), and stellar mass surface\ndensity (Sigma_Mstar); and (2) study of the relationship between T_dust and\ndust mass surface density (Sigma_dust).\n  Results.

In order to justify the laboratory searches in this\ncosmologically-forbidden region, it is often argued that adding new dark sector\ndecay modes of HNLs can evade the stringent BBN constraint. Here we rule out\nthis possibility and show that, contrary to the naive expectation, HNLs with\nsignificant dark decay modes actually lead to stronger cosmological bounds.\nThis is mainly because of the increase in the extra radiation energy density in\nthe Universe around the BBN epoch, which causes observable effects in the\nprimordial helium fraction and $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$. Our result has major\nimplications for laboratory searches of HNLs."}

Depending on the symmetry-breaking pattern,\nthey can be either topologically stable or metastable. Intriguingly, metastable\nstrings have been proposed as a possible origin of the gravitational wave (GW)\nbackground observed by recent pulsar timing array experiments. When metastable\nstrings decay, they fragment into segments with monopoles and antimonopoles\nattached at their endpoints. The monopole and antimonopole are strongly pulled\nby the string tension. Violent oscillations of these segments have been\nconsidered as a potential GW source, in addition to contributions from string\nloops. We show that, in realistic situations, the monopoles frequently collide\nwith thermal fluctuations on the string segments, which act as a resistance and\nprevent the oscillation. As a result, we find that the contribution from string\nsegments to the GW background is negligible."}

The origin\nof the high velocities of such runaway stars have been debated since the 1960s,\nresulting either from dynamical ejections\n\\citep{1961BAN....15..265B,1961BAN....15..291B} or from supernova explosions\n\\citep{1983ApJ...267..322H}. Due to the Gaia satellite's outstanding precision,\nwe can now retrace the most recently ejected binary star, Mel 34, back to the\ncenter of R136 and reconstruct the events that 52\\,000 years ago let to its\nremoval from R136, i.e., we establish its dynamical interaction and ejection\nhistory. We find that this ejection requires the participation of 5 stars in a\nstrong interaction between a triple composed of the tight massive binary Mel~39\norbited by the star VFTS~590, and the binary star Mel~34. The participation of\n5 stars is unexpected because runaway stars were not expected to result from\ntriple interactions \\cite{2011Sci...334.1380F}. The deterministic nature of the\nNewtonian dynamics in the scattering enables us to reconstruct the encounter\nthat ejected Mel~34. We then predict that Mel~39 is a binary star with an\n80\\,\\Msun\\, companion star that orbits within $\\sim 1^\\circ$ in the same plane\nas Mel~34, and escapes the cluster with a velocity of $\\sim 64$\\,km/s. The five\nstars will undergo supernova explosions in the coming 5\\,Myr at a distance of\n$\\sim 180$\\,pc to $\\sim 332$\\,pc from their birth location (R\\,136). The\nresulting black hole binaries, however, are not expected to merge within a\nHubble time."}

We report observations of 3I/ATLAS taken on 2025 July 3 and 4\nwith the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility just days after its discovery. In\nr'-band imaging with 'Opihi, we see no obvious lightcurve variability and\nderive a g'-i' color of 1.06+/-0.11 which is consistent in spectral slope to\nrecent work by D.Z. Seligman et al. (2025) and C. Opitom (2025). We obtained\nthe first near-infrared (NIR) reflectance spectrum of 3I/ATLAS with SpeX. The\nvisible color and NIR spectrum show a linear, red visible slope, a somewhat\nless red slope between 0.7 and 1.1 $\\mu{m}$, and a neutral or slightly blue\nslope at longer wavelengths. Challenges in modeling the reflectivity of 3I may\nindicate that this comet has a complex grain size distribution, grain\ncompositions unlike Solar system comets, or both.
