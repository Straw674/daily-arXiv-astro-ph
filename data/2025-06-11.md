### [1] [JWST interferometric imaging reveals the dusty disk obscuring the supermassive black hole of the Circinus galaxy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08077)
*Enrique Lopez-Rodriguez,Joel Sanchez-Bermudez,Omaira Gonzalez-Martin,Robert Nikutta,Ryan M. Lau,Deepashri Thatte,Ismael Garcia-Bernete,Julien H. Girard,Matthew J. Hankins*

**TL;DR**: 利用JWST的新型孔径掩模干涉模式，研究揭示了尘埃和分子环是超大质量黑洞与宿主星系之间物质输送的关键界面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 尘埃和分子环是围绕超大质量黑洞的最难以捉摸的结构之一，但其在理解反馈和吸积机制中的重要性不容忽视。环和吸积盘将气体输送到超大质量黑洞并引发外流，从而将黑洞活动与宿主星系联系起来。

Data: 使用了JWST的新型孔径掩模干涉模式数据，结合连续谱数据、气体示踪剂和环模型。

Method: 采用了JWST的新型孔径掩模干涉模式，实现了比以往高一倍的分辨率。

Result: 研究发现尘埃和分子环是物质从星系尺度输送到超大质量黑洞的关键界面，并识别出小于1%的发射来自热尘埃组成的弧结构，其余12%的发射与AGN和/或射电喷流加热的尘埃相关。

Abstract: The dusty and molecular torus is one of the most elusive structures
surrounding supermassive black holes, yet its importance is unequivocal for
understanding feedback and accretion mechanisms. The torus and accretion disk
feed the inspiraling gas onto the supermassive black hole (SMBH) and launch
outflows, fundamentally connecting the SMBH activity to the host galaxy. This
scenario situates the torus as the interface between the AGN and its host
galaxy with a flow cycle of molecular gas and dust of a few parsecs in size.
Here, we utilize a novel aperture-masking interferometric mode onboard the
JWST, achieving twice the previously possible resolution, and bringing out the
fainter features that clearly show the torus being the critical interface for
feeding material from galaxy scales into the SMBH. We also identify that $<1$%
of the emission arises from an arc structure composed of hot dust entrained in
a molecular and ionized outflow. The rest of the emission, $12$%, is associated
with dust heated by the AGN and/or radio-jet at large scales. Combined with
continuum data, gas tracers, and torus models, our study shows that most of the
dust mass is located in the equatorial axis in the form of a disk feeding the
AGN.

*Danny Horta,Melissa K. Ness*

**TL;DR**: 通过分析APOGEE调查数据，研究发现银河系球状星团、晕亚结构与卫星矮星系在α元素丰度比（hex ratio）上存在显著差异，并揭示了hex ratio与[Fe/H]及年龄的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 恒星大气中的元素丰度比保留了其诞生条件的信息，有助于揭示其起源和性质。本研究对比了银河系球状星团、晕亚结构、卫星星系以及银河系高/低α盘中的静力学和爆炸性α元素丰度比及其比值（hex ratio）。

Data: 使用了APOGEE调查的数据，涵盖了银河系球状星团、晕亚结构、卫星星系以及银河系高/低α盘。

Method: 分析了静力学和爆炸性α元素丰度比及其比值（hex ratio），并对比了不同恒星群体的数据。

Result: 研究发现：i）银河系球状星团和晕亚结构的hex ratio在广泛的[Fe/H]范围内相似且高于卫星矮星系；ii）所有恒星群体的hex ratio与[Fe/H]存在趋势；iii）银河系球状星团的hex ratio与年龄有微弱关联，但与初始或最终质量无关；iv）原位形成与吸积的球状星团在hex ratio上无差异。

Abstract: Stellar atmospheric element abundance ratios of stars retain information
about their birth conditions, helping elucidate their origin and nature. In
this letter, we analyse and contrast the hydrostatic and explosive
$\alpha$-element abundance ratios, and the ratio of the two (the hex ratio),
for a large sample of Galactic globular clusters (GCs), halo substructures,
satellite galaxies, and the Milky Way high-/low-$\alpha$ discs using data from
the $APOGEE$ survey. Our results show that: $i$) Milky Way GCs and halo
substructures appear to have qualitatively similar hex ratios across a broad
range of [Fe/H], that are higher than that of dwarf satellite galaxies of
similar [Fe/H]; $ii$) for all stellar populations studied, there is a trend in
the hex ratio with [Fe/H]; $iii$) there is a weak trend in the hex ratio with
respect to age for Galactic GCs, but not with initial or final GC mass; $iv$)
there are no differences in the hex ratio between GCs formed $in$ $situ$ versus
those labelled as accreted.

### [3] [The impact of applying black hole-host galaxy scaling relations to large galaxy populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08102)
*Maggie C. Huber,Joseph Simon,Julia M. Comerford*

**TL;DR**: The study compares the impact of different scaling relations (M_BH-M_bulge and M_BH-σ) on SMBH mass estimates, finding that M_BH-σ better reproduces virial masses from Hβ, and suggests inferring σ from photometry when direct measurements are unavailable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) exhibit empirical correlations with host galaxy properties, but the scaling relations used to estimate their masses vary significantly, often derived from a small subset of nearby galaxies.

Data: The study uses a sample of ∼400,000 galaxies, including 1,240 Type 1 AGN from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

Method: SMBH masses are calculated using M_BH-M_bulge and M_BH-σ scaling relations and compared to single-epoch virial SMBH masses derived from broad-line Hβ.

Result: SMBH masses from M_BH-σ better match virial masses from Hβ than M_BH-M_bulge, and σ can be inferred from photometry more accurately than M_bulge when direct measurements are unavailable.

Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with dynamically measured masses have shown
empirical correlations with host galaxy properties. These correlations are
often the only method available to estimate SMBH masses and gather statistics
for large galaxy populations across a range of redshifts, even though the
scaling relations themselves are derived from a small subset of nearby
galaxies. Depending on the scaling relation used, estimated SMBH masses can
vary significantly. The most widely used scaling relations are the
M$_{BH}-$M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$ and M$_{BH}- \sigma$ relations, where
M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$ is galaxy bulge mass and $\sigma$ is the bulge velocity
dispersion. In this paper, we determine how severely the choice of scaling
relation impacts SMBH mass estimates for different subsets of a large galaxy
population. For this analysis we use a sample of $\sim$ 400,000 galaxies,
including 1,240 Type 1 AGN from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We calculate SMBH
masses from M$_{BH}-$M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$ and M$_{BH}- \sigma$ and compare to
single-epoch virial SMBH masses from broad-line H$\beta$, which are derived
independently of black hole-host galaxy scaling relations. We find that SMBH
masses derived from the single-epoch virial relation for H$\beta$ are better
reproduced by M$_{BH}- \sigma$ than M$_{BH}-$M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$. Finally, in
cases where $\sigma$ and M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$ cannot be measured directly, we
show that it is possible to infer $\sigma$ from photometry with more accuracy
than we can infer M$_{\mathrm{bulge}}$.

### [4] [First joint absorption and T$_e$-based metallicity measured in a GRB host galaxy at $z=4.28$ using JWST/NIRSpec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08114)
*Anne Inkenhaag,Patricia Schady,Phil Wiseman,Robert M. Yates,Maryam Arabsalmani,Lise Christensen,Valerio D'Elia,Massimiliano De Pasquale,Rubén García-Benito,Dieter H.

Vergani,Klaas Wiersema*

**TL;DR**: 本文首次利用JWST/NIRSpec光谱测量了GRB 050505宿主星系（红移z=4.28）的吸收线和电子温度（Te）金属丰度，发现冷星际气体与暖气体金属丰度一致，表明GRB余辉吸收线可作为星系金属丰度的可靠示踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 目前对高红移星系金属丰度的研究主要依赖于发射线光谱，但对于极暗星系或早期宇宙化学演化的研究存在局限性。GRB余辉吸收线提供了一种潜在的新方法，但其与星系整体金属丰度的关系尚需验证。

Data: 使用了JWST/NIRSpec光谱数据，包括GRB 050505宿主星系的红移z=4.28的[OIII]λ4363极光线和GRB余辉吸收线数据。

Method: 通过温度敏感的[OIII]λ4363极光线测量暖气体金属丰度，同时利用GRB余辉吸收线测量冷星际气体金属丰度，并比较两种方法的金属丰度结果。

Result: 研究发现冷星际气体金属丰度（12 + log(O/H)∼7.7）与暖气体金属丰度（12 + log(O/H) = 7.80±0.19和7.96±0.21）一致，表明GRB余辉吸收线可作为星系金属丰度的可靠示踪，为早期宇宙化学演化研究提供了新途径。

Abstract: We present the first gamma-ray burst (GRB) host galaxy with a measured
absorption line and electron temperature (T$_e$) based metallicity, using the
temperature sensitive [OIII]$\lambda$4363 auroral line detected in the
JWST/NIRSpec spectrum of the host of GRB 050505 at redshift $z=4.28$. We find
that the metallicity of the cold interstellar gas, derived from the absorption
lines in the GRB afterglow, of 12 + log(O/H)$\sim 7.7$ is in reasonable
agreement with the temperature-based emission line metallicity in the warm gas
of the GRB host galaxy, which has values of 12 + log(O/H) = 7.80$\pm$0.19 and
7.96$\pm$0.21 for two common indicators. When using strong emission line
diagnostics appropriate for high-z galaxies and sensitive to ionisation
parameter, we find good agreement between the strong emission line metallicity
and the other two methods. Our results imply that, for the host of GRB050505,
mixing between the warm and the cold ISM along the line of sight to the GRB is
efficient, and that GRB afterglow absorption lines can be a reliable tracer of
the metallicity of the galaxy. If confirmed with a large sample, this suggest
that metallicities determined via GRB afterglow spectroscopy can be used to
trace cosmic chemical evolution to the earliest cosmic epochs and in galaxies
far too faint for emission line spectroscopy, even for JWST.

### [5] [The properties of primordially-seeded black holes and their hosts in the first billion years: implications for JWST](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08116)
*Pratika Dayal,Roberto maiolino*

**TL;DR**: JWST观测揭示了红移z∼10.4处可能存在黑洞，其异常高的黑洞与恒星质量比挑战了传统天体物理模型，本文通过宇宙学原初黑洞（PBH）模型解释了这些现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: JWST观测发现红移z∼10处存在异常大质量黑洞及高黑洞与恒星质量比（MBH/M*≥0.1），这对传统天体物理模型提出了挑战。

Data: JWST观测数据，红移z∼10.4处的黑洞性质。

Method: 使用PHANES分析框架，研究由质量在10^0.5−10^6 M⊙的原初黑洞（PBH）种子的暗物质晕及其重子物质在宇宙前10亿年的演化。

Result: PBH种子模型预测了红移z∼5（15）处黑洞质量函数范围为10^1.25−11.25（10^0.75−7.25）M⊙，并自然产生高MBH/M*≥0.25的极端贫金属系统，与当前宇宙学和天体物理界限一致。

Abstract: James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations have opened a tantalising new
window onto possible black holes as early as redshifts of $z \sim 10.4$. These
show a number of puzzling properties including unexpectedly massive black holes
in place by $z \sim 10$ and inexplicably high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios
of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\geq 0.1$. These pose a serious challenge for "astrophysical"
seeding and growth models that we aim to explain with ``cosmological"
primordial black holes (PBHs) in this work. We present PHANES, an analytic
framework that follows the evolution of dark matter halos, and their baryons in
the first billion years, seeded by a population of PBHs with seed masses
between $10^{0.5}-10^6 M_\odot$. PBH seeded models yield a black hole mass
function that extends between $10^{1.25-11.25} ~(10^{0.75-7.25})M_\odot$ at $z
\sim 5 (15)$ for the different models considered in this work. Interestingly,
PBH-seeded models (with spin $s=0$ or $-1$) naturally result in extremely high
values of $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\geq 0.25$ at $z \sim 5-15$. For a typical stellar
mass of $M_* =10^9 M_\odot$, we find an average value of $M_{\rm BH}/M_* \sim
0.4~ (1.6)$ for $s=0~(-1)$ at $z=5$, providing a smoking gun for PBH-seeded
models. Another particularity of PBH-seeded models is their ability of
producing systems with high black hole-to-stellar mass ratios that are
extremely metal poor ($Z \leq 10^{-2}~Z_\odot$). Yielding a PBH-to-dark matter
fraction $\leq 10^{-9}$ and a stellar mass function that lies four orders of
magnitude below observations, our model is in accord with all current
cosmological and astrophysical bounds.

### [6] [IRAS 16475-4609: A Young Compact HII Region Sculpting Its Molecular Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08180)
*Felipe Navarete,Sean D. Points,Augusto Damineli*

**TL;DR**: 通过近红外光谱和成像分析，研究发现IRAS 16475-4609是一个由早期B型恒星驱动的年轻大质量恒星形成区，处于超致密和致密HII区的过渡阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究背景聚焦于恒星形成区IRAS 16475-4609，旨在通过多波段数据揭示其物理特性和演化状态，为理解致密HII区的早期演化提供新见解。

Data: 使用了TripleSpec/SOAR光谱、NEWFIRM/CTIO成像数据，以及存档的射电和亚毫米数据。

Method: 采用了近红外光谱和成像分析技术，结合射电和亚毫米数据的多波段研究方法。

Result: 研究发现IRAS 16475-4609是一个由B0-B0.7V型恒星驱动的致密HII区，距离为3.51±0.74 kpc，电离气体半径为0.27±0.06 pc，并揭示了其周围高密度分子团块的存在，表明恒星反馈正在塑造其环境。

Abstract: We present a near-infrared spectroscopic and imaging analysis of the
star-forming region IRAS 16475-4609, based on TripleSpec/SOAR spectroscopy and
NEWFIRM/CTIO imaging, complemented by archival radio and sub-millimeter data.
Our spectroscopic analysis indicates that the central source is an early B-type
star (B0-B0.7V) powering a compact HII region characterized by strong HI and
HeI recombination lines, and molecular H$_2$ emission. We derive a distance of
3.51$\pm$0.74 kpc, consistent with the position of the Scutum-Crux near arm at
Galactic longitudes of $\sim$340$^\circ$. At this distance, the ionized gas
traced by Brackett-$\gamma$ emission has a radius of 0.27$\pm$0.06 pc, placing
the source in a transition phase between ultra-compact and compact HII regions.
From radio data, we estimate an ionizing photon flux of
N$_{ly}$=(2.3$\pm$0.3)$\times10^{47}$ photons s$^{-1}$, and an electron
temperature of T$_e$=(5.4$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^3$ K for the ionized gas. The
analysis also reveals an obscured high-density molecular clump southwest of the
HII region, coincident with an ATLASGAL sub-millimeter peak, indicating a
potential site of ongoing and triggered star formation as the ionization front
advances into the surrounding molecular material. These results suggest that
IRAS 16475-4609 is a young high-mass star-forming region with stellar feedback
actively shaping its environment, offering valuable insight into the early
evolution of compact HII regions.

### [7] [Ly$α$ radiative transfer modeling for 163 MUSE Ly$α$-emitting galaxies at $z=$3--6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08290)
*Sangeun Yu,Hyunmi Song,Kwang-il Seon*

**TL;DR**: 通过Lyα辐射传输计算研究了哈勃超深场中163个恒星形成星系周围的Lyα晕的性质，发现其空间范围主要由介质和源的分布决定，光谱特征则受光学深度和介质速度结构的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Lyα辐射传输在星系周围形成扩展晕的现象是研究星系形成和演化的重要课题，但此前的研究样本较小（仅8个星系），限制了结论的普遍性。

Data: 使用了哈勃超深场中163个恒星形成星系的多单元光谱仪观测数据。

Method: 基于Song2020的Lyα辐射传输计算，通过同时拟合Lyα光谱和表面亮度分布（SBPs）来推导最佳模型。

Result: 研究发现Lyα晕的空间范围主要由介质和源的分布决定，光谱特征受光学深度和介质速度结构影响，且模型参数之间存在复杂的相互依赖性。

Abstract: We utilized Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer calculations from \citet{Song2020}
to investigate the properties of extended Ly$\alpha$ halos around star-forming
galaxies in the \textit{Hubble} Ultra Deep Field, observed by the Multi-Unit
Spectroscopic Explorer. Expanding on the work of \citet{Song2020}, which was
limited to eight galaxies, we derived best-fit models for a significantly
larger sample of 163 galaxies, which successfully reproduced both their
Ly$\alpha$ spectra and surface brightness profiles (SBPs). These best-fit
models suggest a broad medium distribution surrounding each galaxy, with low
expanding velocities at large radii. This conclusion could not have been drawn
from modeling either the spectrum or SBP alone, but only through simultaneous
modeling of both. Our correlation analysis between observables and model
parameters reveals that the spatial extent of Ly$\alpha$ halos is primarily
determined by the extents of the medium and the source, while the spectral peak
shift and full width at half maximum are governed mainly by optical depth, with
the velocity structure of the medium playing a secondary yet non-negligible
role. The fact that various correlations derived from the full set of models
and those from the best-fit subset can differ significantly highlights the
complex and interdependent nature of Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer. All model
parameters interact to shape the observed Ly$\alpha$ features in a non-trivial
way.

**TL;DR**: 通过多波长监测数据分析了M17 H2区域年轻恒星天体（YSO）的亚毫米和中红外变异性，揭示了不同演化阶段的变异性特征及其与恒星形成环境的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前对年轻恒星天体（YSO）变异性研究主要集中在近红外和光学波段，而亚毫米和中红外波段的长期监测数据较少，M17 H2区域的反馈效应和距离因素可能影响变异性检测。

Data: 使用了JCMT瞬态巡天的3.5年450和850微米监测数据，以及NEOWISE任务的9年中红外监测数据，覆盖198个450微米和164个850微米的亚毫米峰值点，以及66个中红外YSO。

Method: 通过多波长监测数据分析YSO的变异性，包括亚毫米和中红外波段的线性变异性、长期趋势和随机变异性。

Result: 发现一个亚毫米线性变异性源（中等质量原恒星），其光度增加下限为16%；中红外波段揭示了22个YSO的长期和随机变异性，早期演化阶段的变异性比例最高，但整体变异性低于其他区域，可能与M17的距离和H2区域的强反馈有关。

Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of young stellar object (YSO)
variability at submillimeter and mid-infrared (mid-IR) wavelengths for the
M\,17 \ion{H}{2} region, using 3.5 years monitoring data from the JCMT
Transient Survey at $450$ and $850\,\mu$m and 9 years mid-IR monitoring data
from the NEOWISE mission. Our study encompasses observations of 198 and 164
bright submillimeter peaks identified within the deep JCMT coadded maps at 450
and $850\,\mu$m, and 66 YSOs seen by NEOWISE W2 that were previously identified
in mid-IR observations. We find one robust linear submillimeter variable, an
intermediate mass protostar, with a $4\%$ peak flux change in 3.5 years of JCMT
monitoring that sets a lower limit of $16\%$ luminosity increase for the
source. At mid-IR wavelengths, our analysis reveals secular and stochastic
variability in 22 YSOs, with the highest fraction of secular variability
occurring at the earliest evolutionary stage. This mid-IR fractional
variability as a function of evolutionary stage result is similar to what has
previously been found for YSO variability within the Gould Belt and the
intermediate-mass star formation region M17\,SWex, though overall less
variability is detected in M\,17 in submillimeter and mid-IR. We suspect that
this lower detection of YSO variability is due to both the greater distance to
M\,17 and the strong feedback from the \ion{H}{2} region. Our findings showcase
the utility of multiwavelength observations to better capture the complex
variability phenomena inherent to star formation processes and demonstrate the
importance of years-long monitoring of a diverse selection of star-forming
environments.

**TL;DR**: A systematic search for Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) and other unusual radio morphologies in the EMU survey's first-year data led to the discovery of five new ORCs and identified 55 Galaxies with Large-scale Ambient Radio Emission (GLAREs), providing insights into their evolutionary processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: ORCs are rare, enigmatic objects characterized by edge-brightened rings of radio emission, often associated with distant galaxies, and their study is significant for understanding unusual radio morphologies and galaxy evolution.

Data: Data from the first year of the EMU (Evolutionary Map of the Universe) survey were used.

Method: A hybrid methodology combining supervised object detection techniques and visual inspection of radio source candidates was employed.

Result: The study discovered five new ORCs and two additional candidate ORCs, identified 55 GLAREs, and highlighted Starburst Radio Ring Galaxies (SRRGs), suggesting the need for multi-wavelength follow-up observations to understand their properties and evolution.

Abstract: We present a systematic search for Odd Radio Circles (ORCs) and other unusual
radio morphologies using data from the first year of the EMU (Evolutionary Map
of the Universe) survey. ORCs are rare, enigmatic objects characterized by
edge-brightened rings of radio emission, often found in association with
distant galaxies. To identify these objects, we employ a hybrid methodology
combining supervised object detection techniques and visual inspection of radio
source candidates. This approach leads to the discovery of five new ORCs and
two additional candidate ORCs, expanding the known population of these objects.
In addition to ORCs, we also identify 55 Galaxies with Large-scale Ambient
Radio Emission (GLAREs), which feature irregular, rectangular, or circular
shapes of diffuse radio emission mostly surrounding central host galaxies.
These GLAREs may represent different evolutionary stages of ORCs, and studying
them could offer valuable insights into their evolutionary processes. We also
highlight a subset of Starburst Radio Ring Galaxies (SRRGs), which are
star-forming galaxies exhibiting edge-brightened radio rings surrounding their
central star-forming regions. We emphasize the importance of multi-wavelength
follow-up observations to better understand the physical properties, host
galaxy characteristics, and evolutionary pathways of these radio sources.

*Kiyoaki Christopher Omori,Connor Bottrell,Sabine Bellstedt,Aaron Robotham,Hassen M. Yesuf,Andy D. Goulding,Marcin Sawicki,Tohru Nagao,Tsutomu T. Takeuchi*

**TL;DR**: 该研究利用HSC-SSP数据和深度学习方法分析星系合并对恒星形成率和活动星系核的影响，发现合并与非合并星系之间差异较小，表明长期过程可能是恒星形成和活动星系核活动的主要驱动因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系合并驱动的内部气体流入被认为会提高恒星形成率（SFR）、促进超大质量黑洞增长并激发活动星系核（AGN），但量化这些现象仍具挑战性，主要由于合并分类和星系及AGN性质测量的困难。

Data: 研究使用了Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP)的观测数据，以及基于Galaxy Cruise项目的图像和标签。

Method: 通过微调预训练的深度表示学习模型Zoobot对HSC-SSP观测图像中的合并星系进行分类，并使用SED拟合代码ProSpect对Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA)光谱进行拟合，以获取星系和AGN的性质。

Result: 研究发现合并与非合并星系在SFR和AGN活动上的差异较小（如ΔSFR=-0.009±0.003 dex），进一步视觉纯化后，合并样本中的差异仍然有限，表明长期过程可能是恒星形成和AGN活动的主要驱动因素。

Abstract: Internal gas inflows driven by galaxy mergers are considered to enhance star
formation rates (SFR), fuel supermassive black hole growth and stimulate active
galactic nuclei (AGN). However, quantifying these phenomena remains a
challenge, due to difficulties both in classifying mergers and in quantifying
galaxy and AGN properties. We quantitatively examine the merger-SFR-AGN
connection using Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) galaxies
using novel methods for both galaxy classification and property measurements.}
{Mergers in HSC-SSP observational images are identified through fine-tuning
Zoobot, a pretrained deep representation learning model, using images and
labels based on the Galaxy Cruise project. We use galaxy and AGN properties
that were produced by fitting Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) spectra using the
SED fitting code ProSpect, which fits panchromatically across the far-UV
through far-infrared wavelengths and obtains galaxy and AGN properties
simultaneously.} \textbf{{Little differences are seen in SFR and AGN activity
between mergers and controls, with $\Delta \mathrm{SFR}=-0.009\pm 0.003$ dex,
$\Delta f_{\mathrm{AGN}}=-0.010\pm0.033$ dex and $\Delta
L_{\mathrm{AGN}}=0.002\pm0.025$ dex. After further visual purification of the
merger sample, we find $\Delta \mathrm{SFR}=-0.033\pm0.014$ dex, $\Delta
f_{\mathrm{AGN}}=-0.024\pm0.170$ dex, and $\Delta
L_{\mathrm{AGN}}=0.019\pm0.129$ dex for pairs, and $\Delta
\mathrm{SFR}=-0.057\pm0.024$ dex, $\Delta f_{\mathrm{AGN}}=0.286\pm0.270$ dex,
and $\Delta L_{\mathrm{AGN}}=0.329\pm0.195$ dex for postmergers. These numbers
suggest secular processes being an important driver for SF and AGN activity,
and present a cautionary tale when using longer timescale tracers.

Data: 研究使用了2MRS-Bright WXSC目录中的126个邻近大质量恒星形成星系（距离小于100 Mpc，恒星质量在10^11.3到10^11.7太阳质量之间，恒星形成率在1到13太阳质量每年之间）的数据。

Method: 通过LEDA形态学分类和暗能量巡天图像的视觉检查，对星系进行分类，并利用BPT图对59个有存档光谱的星系进行发射线测量和分类。

Result: 研究发现83%的星系为LINERs，且LINER发射可能与恒星形成的气体存在有关。

Abstract: We have examined the nuclear spectra of very massive star-forming galaxies at
$z \sim 0$ to understand how they differ from other galaxies with comparable
masses, which are typically passive. We selected a sample of 126 nearby massive
star-forming galaxies ($<100~{\rm Mpc}$, $10^{11.3}~\rm{M_\odot} \leq M_{\rm
stellar} \leq 10^{11.7}~\rm{M_\odot}$, $1 ~{\rm M_\odot~yr^{-1}}< {\rm SFR} <13
~{\rm M_\odot~yr^{-1}}$) from the 2MRS-Bright WXSC catalogue. LEDA morphologies
indicate at least 63\% of our galaxies are spirals, while visual inspection of
Dark Energy Survey images reveals 75\% of our galaxies to be spirals with the
remainder being lenticular. Of our sample 59 have archival nuclear spectra,
which we have modelled and subsequently measured emission lines
([NII]$\rm{\lambda 6583}$, H$\alpha\rm{\lambda 6563}$, [OIII]$\rm{\lambda
5008}$, and H$\beta\rm{\lambda 4863}$), classifying galaxies as star-forming,
LINERS, or AGNs. Using a BPT diagram we find $83 \pm 6$ \% of our galaxies,
with sufficient signal-to-noise to measure all 4 emission lines, to be LINERs.
Using the [NII]$\rm{\lambda 6583}$/H$\alpha\rm{\lambda 6563}$ emission line
ratio alone we find that $79 \pm 6$ \% of the galaxies (46 galaxies) with
archival spectra are LINERs, whereas just $\sim 30\%$ of the overall massive
galaxy population are LINERs (Belfiore et al. 2016). Our sample can be
considered a local analogue of the Ogle et al. (2016, 2019) sample of $z \sim
0.22$ massive star-forming galaxies in terms of selection criteria, and we find
64\% of their galaxies are LINERs using SDSS spectra. The high frequency of
LINER emission in these massive star-forming galaxies indicates that LINER
emission in massive galaxies may be linked to the presence of gas that fuels
star formation.

*Luke Y. Xia,Courtney Klein,James S. Bullock,Michael Boylan-Kolchin,Vincent Caudillo,Jorge Moreno,Francisco J. Mercado,Robert Feldmann*

**TL;DR**: 研究发现，早期宇宙中观测到的细长星系是星系演化的短暂阶段，而非稳定结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: JWST和HST观测揭示了大量高到中等红移的细长星系，其质量接近银河系前身星系的预期质量。

Data: 使用了13个模拟的银河系质量星系的数据，这些星系采用了FIRE-2物理模型。

Method: 通过降维特征张量量化了这些星系的椭球形状演化。

Result: 研究发现，银河系前身星系在早期宇宙中会经历细长阶段，并在数十亿年时间尺度上在球状和细长形状之间振荡；而z=0时的银河系类似星系则始终保持对称形状，年轻恒星位于薄盘，中年恒星位于厚盘，老年恒星位于扁平球体中。

Abstract: JWST and HST observations have revealed numerous elongated, pickle-shaped
galaxies at high to intermediate redshifts, with masses close to those expected
for Milky Way progenitors. Here we use reduced-mass eigentensors to quantify
the ellipsoidal shape evolution of thirteen Milky Way-mass galaxies simulated
using FIRE-2 physics; all but one form disks at $z=0$. We find that all of our
Milky Way progenitors go through phases when they are elongated. They often
oscillate between spheroidal and elongated shapes in the early Universe over
billion-year timescales. This is true whether we measure shapes weighted on
stellar mass or luminosity, though the luminosity shapes show more extreme
elongation and variance. In contrast, the stellar populations of our $z=0$
Milky Way analogs are never elongated and always symmetric about their minor
axes. The youngest stars at $z=0$ reside in thin disks, intermediate-age stars
reside in thick disks, and the oldest stars reside in flattened spheroids that
are symmetric about their minor axes. Despite their symmetric shapes at $z=0$,
the old and intermediate age stellar populations were often arranged in the
shape of elongated pickles or triaxial spheroids at the time they formed,
meaning that these populations changed shape significantly over time. Our
results suggest that observed elongated galaxies seen in the early Universe are
not stable structures, but rather reflect transitory phases of galaxy
evolution.

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过中红外选择的AGN样本，在15 Mpc范围内对Compton-thick（CT）AGN群体和AGN的柱密度分布进行了普查，发现低光度AGN的CT比例与高光度AGN一致，但黑洞质量分布显著不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前对Compton-thick（CT）AGN群体和AGN柱密度分布的研究主要集中在较远的样本，而近邻宇宙（15 Mpc内）的低光度AGN研究较少。本研究填补了这一空白，并探索了低光度AGN的CT比例及其宿主星系特性。

Data: 研究使用了来自Chandra和NuSTAR的宽带X射线光谱数据，样本覆盖了2-10 keV内禀光度为10^37至10^43 erg s^-1的AGN。

Method: 通过宽带X射线光谱分析测量柱密度，并与Swift-BAT调查的结果进行比较。

Result: 研究发现CT AGN比例为32^{+30}_{-18}%，低光度AGN（L_2-10,int ≤ 10^42 erg s^-1）的CT比例为19^{+30}_{-14}%。宿主星系特性显示恒星形成率一致，但黑洞质量分布显著不同（低约1.5 dex）。此外，样本中LINERs和HII型核的比例更高。

Abstract: We present a census of the Compton-thick (CT) active galactic nucleus (AGN)
population and the column density ($N_{\rm{H}}$) distribution of AGN in our
cosmic backyard using a mid-infrared selected AGN sample within 15 Mpc. The
column densities are measured from broadband X-ray spectral analysis, mainly
using data from $\textit{Chandra}$ and $\textit{NuSTAR}$. Our sample probes AGN
with intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosities of $L_{\rm 2-10, int} = 10^{37}$-$10^{43}$
erg s$^{-1}$, reaching a parameter space inaccessible to more distant samples.
We directly measure a 32$^{+30}_{-18}\%$ CT AGN fraction and obtain an
$N_{\rm{H}}$ distribution that agrees with that inferred by the
$\textit{Swift}$-BAT survey. Restricting the sample to the largely unexplored
domain of low-luminosity AGN with $L_{\rm 2-10, int}$ $\leq$ $10^{42}$ erg
s$^{-1}$, we found a CT fraction of 19$^{+30}_{-14}\%$, consistent with those
observed at higher luminosities. Comparing the host-galaxy properties between
the two samples, we find consistent star formation rates, though the majority
of our galaxy have lower stellar masses (by $\approx 0.3$ dex). In contrast,
the two samples have very different black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$)
distributions, with our sample having $\approx$1.5 dex lower mean mass ($M_{\rm
BH}$ $\sim$ 10$^{6}$ $M_\odot$). Additionally, our sample contains a
significantly higher number of LINERs and H$_{\rm{II}}$-type nuclei. The
Eddington ratio range probed by our sample, however, is the same as
$\textit{Swift}$-BAT, although the latter dominates at higher accretion rates,
and our sample is more evenly distributed. The majority of our sample with
$\lambda_{\rm Edd} \ge$ 10$^{-3}$ tend to be CT, while those with $\lambda_{\rm
Edd} <$ 10$^{-3}$ are mostly unobscured or mildly obscured.

**TL;DR**: 本文通过理想化的流体动力学模拟研究了膨胀风对冷云生存、形态和动力学的影响，揭示了云在膨胀风中的演化机制及其对多相外流径向特性的潜在影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 多波长观测揭示了多相外流在星系及其周围气体和金属再分布中的关键作用。然而，大多数理想化模拟忽略了外流自然膨胀和风条件随下游变化这一关键方面。

Data: 本文使用了理想化的流体动力学模拟数据。

Method: 采用流体动力学模拟方法，模拟了辐射性云破碎在膨胀风中的过程，背景风采用Chevalier & Clegg 1985 (CC85)的绝热解析解模型。

Result: 研究发现，云在膨胀风中保持局部等压状态，导致其与环境介质的密度对比急剧下降，最终消散于风中；云的膨胀和局部压力平衡是冷质量增长的关键调节因素，且云的动力学可能显著改变宿主多相外流的径向特性。

Abstract: Multiwavelength observations reveal multiphase outflows that play a crucial
role in redistributing gas and metals in and around galaxies. Theoretical
modelling of such multiphase outflows often employs wind tunnel simulations of
a spherical cold ($\sim 10^4 \ \rm K$) cloud facing a uniform hot ($\sim 10^6\
\rm K$) wind. However, outflows are naturally expanding and wind conditions
change downstream -- a crucial aspect overlooked in most idealized simulations.
To address this, we examine how an expanding wind influences the survival,
morphology, and dynamics of a cloud. We perform idealized hydrodynamic
simulations of radiative cloud-crushing in an expanding wind, where the steady
background wind is modelled using the adiabatic Chevalier & Clegg 1985 (CC85)
analytic solution. Moving downstream, we find that the clouds remain locally
isobaric with the wind, leading to a steep decline in their density contrast
with respect to the ambient medium, and they eventually dissipate into the
wind. This also suppresses the growth of cold gas mass in comparison to a
plane-parallel wind since entrained clouds move into a less radiative
background. Using analytic scaling arguments, we present a physical picture of
cloud evolution in a CC85 wind. Cloud expansion and local pressure equilibrium
are the key regulators of cold mass growth. Unlike traditional homogeneous wind
tunnel simulations, our simulations account for the differential expansion
experienced by the long cometary tails of clouds moving in an outflow.
Consequently, a strong head-to-tail emission gradient in the filamentary cold
gas tails develop -- features closer to observations. In addition, we
demonstrate that the dynamics of individual clouds may substantially alter the
radial properties of their host multiphase outflows.

*Ziqian Hua,Zhiyuan Li*

**TL;DR**: 通过分析银河中心年轻星团和孤立大质量恒星的X射线光谱，研究了重元素丰度及其对恒星形成历史和Sgr A*吸积流成分的启示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 银河中心的元素丰度对理解恒星形成历史具有重要意义，热X射线光谱为研究重元素丰度提供了可靠手段。

Data: 使用了深空档案Chandra观测数据，分析了Arches星团中的三个源、Quintuplet星团中的一个源以及一个名为Edd 1的场源。

Method: 采用了两温非平衡电离等离子体模型进行光谱拟合，考虑了WR星风特有的轻元素组成（氢贫乏但氮和/或碳富集）。

Result: 发现Arches和Quintuplet的WR星在Si、S和Ar的丰度上相似，但在Ca和Fe丰度上存在差异，可能与Quintuplet中后两种元素的尘埃耗损有关；WR星风的近太阳或亚太阳金属丰度可能是母星核合成和内部混合的结果。

Abstract: Elemental abundances hold important information about the star formation
history in the Galactic Center. The thermal X-ray spectra of certain stars can
provide a robust probe of elemental abundances, mainly through the presence of
K-shell emission lines. In this work, based on deep archival {\it Chandra}
observations, we obtain X-ray measurements of five heavy elements (Si, S, Ar,
Ca and Fe) for three sources in the Arches cluster, one source in the
Quintuplet cluster, as well as a field source known as Edd 1, which are all
probable WR stars exhibiting a high quality X-ray spectrum. A two-temperature,
non-equilibrium ionization plasma model is employed for the spectral fit,
taking into account light element compositions characteristic of WR star winds,
which is substantially depleted in hydrogen but enriched in nitrogen and/or
carbon. It is found that the Arches and Quintuplet WR stars share similar
abundances of Si, S, and Ar, while exhibiting distinct Ca and Fe abundances,
which may be understood as due to dust depletion of the latter two elements in
Quintuplet. The observed near-solar or sub-solar metallicity of the WR star
winds can be naturally understood as the result of nucleosynthesis and internal
mixing of the parent star, which have a supersolar initial metallicity as
expected for the Galactic center in general. Implications of our findings on
the origin of the young star clusters and isolated massive stars in the
Galactic center, as well as the elemental composition of the accretion flow
onto Sgr A*, are addressed.

**TL;DR**: 首次在外银河系中探测到空间分辨的原恒星外流和喷流，揭示了低金属环境下早期恒星形成与内银河系的相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究背景聚焦于外银河系（距离银心15.7--17.4 kpc）中恒星形成区域的观测，填补了现有研究中外银河系原恒星外流和喷流探测的空白。

Data: 使用阿塔卡马大型毫米波/亚毫米波阵列（ALMA）观测了外银河系的五个恒星形成区域（Sh 2--283, NOMF05-16/19/23/63）。

Method: 通过ALMA观测CO(3--2)发射线，分析了外流和喷流的空间分布及速度结构。

Result: 在Sh 2--283中探测到速度范围5--50 km s^-1的外流和50--100 km s^-1的喷流，喷流呈现多子弹结构；发现Hubble-like流和周期性喷流的脊柱状结构，表明间歇性质量抛射事件（间隔900--4000年）；外银河系原恒星系统的物理特性与内银河系相似，但SiO/CO比例较低，可能反映不同的激波化学或尘埃组成。

Abstract: We present the first detection of spatially resolved protostellar outflows
and jets in the outer Galaxy. We observed five star-forming regions in the
outer Galaxy (Sh 2--283, NOMF05-16/19/23/63; galactocentric distance =
15.7--17.4 kpc) with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA).
Towards Sh 2--283, we have detected distinct outflow ($\sim$5--50 km s$^{-1}$)
and jet components ($\sim$50--100 km s$^{-1}$) associated with the protostar in
CO(3--2) emission. The outflows and jets are well-collimated, with the jets
exhibiting multiple bullet structures. The position-velocity diagram along the
CO flow axis shows two characteristic structures: (a) the flow velocity which
linearly increases with the position offset from the core center (Hubble-like
flow), and (b) continuous velocity components of the periodical flows
(spine-like structures), which may indicate the episodic mass-ejection event.
The time intervals of the mass-ejection events are estimated to be 900--4000
years based on the slopes of these spine-like structures. These characteristics
align with those of nearby protostellar systems, indicating that early star
formation in low-metallicity environments, such as the outer Galaxy, resembles
that in the inner Galaxy. In contrast to the physical similarities, the
$N\mathrm{(SiO)}$/$N\mathrm{(CO)}$ ratio in the jet bullet appears to be lower
than that measured in the low-mass protostellar sources in the inner Galaxy.
This may indicate the different shock chemistry or different dust composition
in the outer Galaxy source, although non-LTE effects could also affect the
observed low $N\mathrm{(SiO)}$/$N\mathrm{(CO)}$ ratio. We also report the new
detection of the other 4 outflow sources in the outer Galaxy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 目前星团与模型间颜色指数的差异主要源于孔径内亮星的投影问题，自适应孔径测光方法被提出以减少这一问题。

Data: 研究使用了M 31 Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT)巡天的星团数据，并生成了人工3D星团网络以模拟不同参数下的星团图像。

Method: 采用自适应孔径测光方法，模拟了100个方向的2D投影图像，并在六个波段生成星团图像以匹配PHAT巡天。

Result: 研究发现，星团有无后主序星存在显著光度差异，可靠参数测量需使用大于半光半径的孔径，年轻星团参数测定存在困难，视角随机性可能导致颜色指数不确定性达0.1星等。

Abstract: Recently, it has been noticed that the discrepancies in the integrated colour
indices (CIs) between star clusters and models are mostly due to the projection
of bright stars in the apertures. In order to reduce this problem, the method
of adaptive aperture photometry has been proposed. This method has been applied
to star clusters from the M 31 Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT)
survey, and studies show that the adaptive aperture photometry performs better
than the conventional approach. The aim of this study is to determine the best
achievable limits on the accuracy and applicability of the aperture photometry
method for studying star clusters in the local Universe. We computed a large
network of artificial 3D star clusters spanning the parameter space of the M 31
clusters. We then simulated images of these clusters by projecting each onto a
2D plane from 100 directions. Star cluster images were generated in six
passbands to match the PHAT survey. To investigate the limiting accuracy of
aperture photometry and the limits of its applicability to star cluster
studies, we measured the simulated images and performed parameter determination
tests. We demonstrate that star clusters with and without post-main-sequence
stars have significant photometric differences. We show that in order to obtain
reliable physical parameters of star clusters, the CIs must be measured using
an aperture with a radius larger than the cluster's half-light radius.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the parameter determination of young clusters
(~10 Myr) is problematic regardless of the aperture size used. Therefore, it is
advisable to determine the parameters of these clusters using colour-magnitude
diagram fitting methods, when possible. We also show that the randomness of the
viewing angle can lead to a CI uncertainty of up to 0.1 mag, depending on
cluster parameters and aperture size.

**TL;DR**: XRISM首次在X射线双星4U 1630-472和GX 340+0的光谱中高信号检测到星际原子SII K-beta吸收特征，并测量了SII Kbeta线中心能量为2470.8 +/- 1.1 eV，同时发现S在尘埃中的消耗率为40% +/- 15%。

Background: X射线成像光谱任务（XRISM）提供了研究星际介质（ISM）中硫（S）K壳层光吸收特征的最佳光谱分辨率。

Data: 使用了XRISM对X射线双星4U 1630-472和GX 340+0的观测数据，特别是GX 340+0的300 ks观测数据。

Method: 通过分析SII K-beta吸收特征和S在尘埃中的吸收残余，结合Fe-S化合物的吸收模板进行拟合。

Result: 首次检测到星际原子SII K-beta吸收特征，测量其线中心能量为2470.8 +/- 1.1 eV，并发现S在尘埃中的消耗率为40% +/- 15%，同时提供了Fe-S化合物中Fe结合比例的上限（< 25%）。

Abstract: The X-ray Imaging Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) provides the best spectral
resolution with which to study Sulfur (S) K-shell photoabsorption features from
the interstellar medium (ISM). For the first time, we demonstrate the
high-signal detection of interstellar atomic SII K-beta absorption in the
spectrum of X-ray binaries (XRBs) 4U 1630-472 and GX 340+0. The persistence of
this feature across multiple instruments, targets, and flux states implies that
it is interstellar in nature. We measure the SII Kbeta line centroid at 2470.8
+/- 1.1 eV after including systematic uncertainties. We also find that the most
recently published high resolution SII absorption template requires a
systematic energy scale shift of +7-8 eV, which is comparable to the level of
disagreement among various atomic modeling procedures. The XRISM 300 ks
observation of GX 340+0 provides unprecedented signal-to-noise in the S K
region, and we find evidence of residual absorption from solid S in the spectra
of GX 340+0. Absorption templates from three Fe-S compounds, troilite (FeS),
pyrrhotite (Fe_7S_8) and pyrite (FeS_2), provide equally good fits to the
residuals. Even though we are not able to distinguish among these three
compounds, they provide equal estimates for the abundance of S locked in dust
grains. Having accounted for both the gaseous and solid S in the GX 340+0
sightline provides us with a direct measurement of S depletion, which is 40%
+/- 15%. Our depletion measurement provides an upper limit to the fraction of
interstellar Fe bound in Fe-S compounds of < 25%, which is consistent with
prior studies of Fe-S compounds via Fe L-shell absorption. Both XRBs in this
study are at a distance of approximately 11 kpc and on the opposite side of the
Galactic disk, suggesting that this value could represent the average S
depletion of the Milky Way when integrated across all phases of the ISM.

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过密度泛函理论探索了CN和CH3自由基在水冰和CO冰上的反应，发现它们能高效形成甲基氰化物和甲基异氰化物，并揭示了量子隧穿在反应中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星际分子中最重要的化学官能团之一是腈类，它们是关键的前生物分子，因其与肽键的化学连接在水解后。CN自由基作为最简单的代表，显示出与星际水冰的强相互作用，可能影响其与附近其他自由基的反应性。

Data: 研究使用了密度泛函理论来模拟CN和CH3自由基在水冰和CO冰上的反应。

Method: 研究采用密度泛函理论，通过基准测试后，绘制了这些化学过程的势能面，重点关注它们在水冰和CO冰上的反应性。

Result: 结果表明，CN与CH3自由基在水冰上反应，高效形成CH3CN和CH3NC，但反应受CH3扩散驱动并与反向扩散竞争。C(OH)=NH的形成需要量子隧穿，而CH3C(OH)=NH通过量子隧穿异构化为乙酰胺。在CO冰上，自由基偶联反应无势垒，同样形成氰化物和异氰化物。

Abstract: Context. Among the most significant chemical functional groups of
interstellar molecules are the class of nitriles, which are proposed as key
prebiotic molecules due to their chemical connection to the peptide bond after
hydrolysis. CN radicals, the simplest representative of this group, have been
shown to exhibit strong interactions with interstellar water ices, potentially
impacting their reactivity with other radicals nearby. Aims. This study
explores (a) whether CN and CH3 radicals can readily react to form methyl
cyanide (CH3CN) and its isomer methyl isocyanide (CH3NC); and (b) the
feasibility of the reaction (CN...H2O)hemi -> C(OH)=NH and its potential role
in the formation of acetamide. Methods. Following a benchmark, density
functional theory was employed to map the potential energy surfaces of these
chemical processes, focusing on their reactivity on water and carbon monoxide
ices. Results. The results show that CN reacts with CH3 radicals on water ices,
forming CH3CN and CH3NC efficiently. However, these reactions are driven by
diffusion of CH3 towards the reactive site and subsequently compete with
back-diffusion of CH3 from that site. The formation of the radical intermediate
C(OH)=NH on water ice requires quantum tunnelling and assuming that acetimidic
acid forms via CH3 + C(OH)=NH -> CH3C(OH)=NH, it can also only isomerize into
acetamide through a sizable barrier thanks to quantum tunnelling. Both quantum
tunnelling-driven reactions are highly dependent on the local structure of the
water ice. Finally, radical coupling reactions on carbon monoxide ices are
found to be barrierless for all cases and again, both the cyanide and the
isocyanide are formed. Conclusions. This work reinforces the conclusion that CN
radicals on interstellar grain surfaces are highly reactive and unlikely to
persist unaltered.

Abstract: Diffuse, low surface-brightness radio emission in merging galaxy clusters
provides insights into cosmic structure formation, the growth of magnetic
fields, and turbulence. This paper reports a search for diffuse radio emission
in a pilot sample of six high-redshift ($1.01 < z < 1.31$) galaxy clusters from
the MeerKAT Massive Distant Cluster Survey (MMDCS). These six clusters are
selected as the most massive $(M_{\rm 500c} = 6.7\,- 8.5 \times
10^{14}~\rm{M_{\odot}})$ systems based on their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich mass from
the full MMDCS sample of 30 ACT DR5 clusters, and were observed first to
explore the high-mass, high-redshift regime. Diffuse radio emission is
confidently detected in four clusters and tentatively identified in two, with
$k$-corrected radio powers scaled to 1.4 GHz ranging from $(0.46 \pm 0.16)$ to
$(4.51 \pm 1.68) \times 10^{24}\, \mathrm{WHz^{-1}}$ and linear sizes between
0.47 and 1.08 Mpc. Combining $Chandra$ X-ray data with MeerKAT radio data, we
find that 80$\%$ of clusters with X-ray observations exhibit disturbed
morphologies indicative of mergers. These $z > 1$ galaxy clusters scatter
around the established radio power-mass scaling relation observed at lower
redshifts, supporting turbulent re-acceleration models in high-redshift
mergers. However, their radio spectra are predicted to steepen ($\alpha <
-1.5$) due to enhanced inverse Compton losses in the cosmic microwave

**TL;DR**: 本研究通过半自动化方法分析了LOFAR巡天数据中的射电噪活动星系核（RLAGN）形态分类，发现FR形态与宿主星系质量相关，但FR分界光度与恒星质量或宿主星系绝对星等无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 射电噪活动星系核（RLAGN）的形态多样，Fanaroff-Riley（FR）分类最初被认为与射电光度相关，但近期研究表明射电光度并不能可靠预测形态。

Data: 使用了LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey（LoTSS DR2）的数据，分析了3590个FRII和2354个FRI（红移z ≤ 0.8）的物理和宿主星系性质。

Method: 开发了一种半自动化的方法，通过脊线特征分析对RLAGN进行分类。

Result: 研究发现，在FR分界附近（光度10^25 ≤ L_144 ≤ 10^26 WHz^-1），RLAGN的FRI形态更可能出现在质量更大的宿主星系中，但FR分界光度与恒星质量或宿主星系绝对星等无关。此外，内部环境可能在决定喷流中断中起作用。研究还公开了形态分类的公共目录。

Abstract: Radio-loud active galaxies (RLAGN) can exhibit various morphologies. The
Fanaroff-Riley (FR) classifications, which are defined by the locations of
peaks in surface brightness, have been applied to many catalogues of RLAGN. The
FR classifications were initially found to correlate with radio luminosity.
However, recent surveys have demonstrated that radio luminosity alone does not
reliably predict radio morphology. We have devised a new-semi automated method
involving ridgeline characterisations to compile the largest known classified
catalogue of RLAGN to date with data from the second data release of the LOFAR
Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS DR2). We reassess the FR divide and its cause by
examining the physical and host galaxy properties of $3590$ FRIIs and $2354$
FRIs (at $z \leq 0.8$). We find that RLAGN near the FR divide with $10^{25} \le
L_{144} \le 10^{26} $ WHz$^{-1}$ are more likely to show FRI over FRII
morphology if they occupy more massive host galaxies. We find no correlation,
when considering selection effects, between the FR break luminosity and stellar
mass or host-galaxy rest-frame absolute magnitude. Overall, we find the cause
of different radio morphologies in this sample to be complex. Considering
sources near the FR divide with $10^{25} \le L_{144} \le 10^{26} $ WHz$^{-1}$,
we find evidence to support inner environment having a role in determining jet
disruption. We make available a public catalogue of morphologies for our
sample, which will be of use for future investigations of RLAGN and their
impact on their surroundings.

**TL;DR**: 利用NenuFAR望远镜观测Cassiopeia A和Cygnus A的碳射电复合线（CRRLs），以测量视线云中的电子密度和温度，并展示了NenuFAR在低频CRRLs探测中的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 碳射电复合线（CRRLs）在十米波长范围内可以追踪银河系星际介质（ISM）的弥散相，其观测有助于测量这一相的物理参数。

Data: 使用NenuFAR望远镜对Cassiopeia A和Cygnus A进行了数十小时的观测，数据包括398条Cα线（n=426至826）。

Method: 采用NenuFAR的波束形成模式，开发了去除射频干扰（RFI）和基线校正的管道，并通过拟合吸收谱线来分析视线云。

Result: 在Cassiopeia A和Cygnus A上检测到高信噪比和高分辨率的CRRLs，为弥散ISM的物理性质（如电子温度、密度、辐射场温度等）提供了约束，并展示了NenuFAR在低频CRRLs探测中的潜力。

Abstract: Carbon Radio Recombination Lines (CRRLs) at decametre wavelengths trace the
diffuse phase of the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Galaxy. Their observation
allows to measure physical parameters of this phase. We observed CRRLs with the
recently commissioned New Extension in Nan\c{c}ay Upgrading LOFAR (NenuFAR)
telescope towards two of the brightest sources at low-frequency (10-85 MHz):
Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A (hereafter Cas A and Cyg A respectively), to measure
the density n_e and temperature T_e of electrons in line-of-sight clouds. We
used NenuFAR's beamforming mode, and we integrated several tens of hours on
each source. The nominal spectral resolution was 95.4 Hz. We developed a
pipeline to remove radio frequency interference (RFI) contamination and correct
the baselines. We then fitted the spectral lines observed in absorption,
associated to line-of-sight clouds. Cas A is the brightest source in the sky at
low frequencies and represents an appropriate test bench for this new
telescope. On this source, we detected 398 C\alpha lines between principal
quantum numbers n=426 and n=826. C\alpha lines towards Cyg A were fainter. We
stacked the signal by groups of a few tens of lines to improve the quality of
our fitting process. On both sources we reached significantly higher S/N and
spectral resolution than the most recent detections by the LOw Frequency ARray
(LOFAR). The variation of line shape with n provides constraints on the
physical properties of the clouds: T_e, n_e, the temperature T_0 of the
radiation field, the mean turbulent velocity v_t and the typical size of the
cloud. The NenuFAR observations sample a larger space volume than LOFAR's
towards the same sources due to the differences in instrumental beamsizes, and
the discrepancies highlight the sensitivity of low-frequency CRRLs as probes of
the diffuse ISM, paving the way towards large area surveys of CRRLs in our
Galaxy.

**TL;DR**: The study uses machine learning to analyze star-forming clumps in the Hi-GAL survey, revealing distinct evolutionary phases traced by FIR/sub-mm and NIR/MIR emissions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Star formation studies benefit from large-area Galactic plane surveys, but traditional analysis struggles with complex datasets; machine learning is proposed to uncover hidden patterns and relationships between cold dust and YSOs.

Data: Data from the Hi-GAL survey, including FIR/sub-mm and NIR/MIR observations, are used to study star-forming clumps.

Method: A machine learning-based four-step approach involving feature engineering, data handling, feature selection, and classification is employed.

Result: The study finds that FIR/sub-mm and NIR/MIR emissions trace different evolutionary phases of star-forming clumps, indicating the asynchronous nature of star formation.

Abstract: Star formation (SF) studies are benefiting from the huge amount of data made
available by recent large-area Galactic plane surveys conducted between 2
{\mu}m and 3 mm. Fully characterizing SF demands integrating
far-infrared/sub-millimetre (FIR/sub-mm) data, tracing the earliest phases,
with near-/mid-infrared (NIR/MIR) observations, revealing later stages
characterized by YSOs just before main sequence star appearance. However, the
resulting dataset is often a complex mix of heterogeneous and intricate
features, limiting the effectiveness of traditional analysis in uncovering
hidden patterns and relationships. In this framework, machine learning emerges
as a powerful tool to handle the complexity of feature-rich datasets and
investigate potential physical connections between the cold dust component
traced by FIR/sub-mm emission and the presence of YSOs. We present a study on
the evolutionary path of star forming clumps in the Hi-GAL survey through a
multi-step approach, with the final aims of (a) obtaining a robust and accurate
set of features able to well classify the star forming clumps in Hi-GAL based
on their evolutionary properties, (b) establishing whether a connection exists
between the cold material reservoir in clumps, traced by FIR/sub-mm emission,
and the already formed YSOs, precursors of stars. For these purposes, our
designed experiments aim at testing whether the FIR/sub-mm properties related
to clumps are sufficient to predict the clump evolutionary stage, without
considering the direct information about the embedded YSOs at NIR/MIR. Our
machine learning-based method involves a four-step approach, based on feature
engineering, data handling, feature selection and classification. Our findings
suggest that FIR/sub-mm and NIR/MIR emissions trace different evolutionary
phases of star forming clumps, highlighting the complex and asynchronous nature
of the SF process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 小麦哲伦云（SMC）是银河系的一个卫星星系，是一个不规则矮星系，显示出近期和持续的恒星形成活动。

Data: 使用来自AstroSat上的超紫外成像望远镜的数据，分析了SMC中年龄小于150 Myr的远紫外恒星的空间分布。

Method: 通过空间聚类分析，识别了236个不同显著性水平的年轻恒星结构，并计算了其形态的分形维数。

Result: 研究发现这些结构的形态具有显著的不规则性，其表面密度分布符合对数正态分布，与湍流星际介质的特征相似，支持了层次性恒星形成的湍流调控理论。

Abstract: The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, is an
irregular dwarf galaxy exhibiting evidence of recent and ongoing star
formation. We performed a spatial clustering analysis of far-ultraviolet stars
in the SMC younger than 150 Myr using data from the Ultra Violet Imaging
Telescope onboard AstroSat. We identified 236 young stellar structures as
surface overdensities at different significance levels. The sizes of these
structures range from a few parsecs to several hundred parsecs. Their irregular
morphologies are characterized by a perimeter-area dimension, derived from the
projected boundaries of the young stellar structures, of Dp = 1.46 +/- 0.4. The
2D fractal dimensions obtained from, respectively, the number-size relation and
the size distribution are D2 = 1.64 +/- 0.03 and D2 = 1.31 +/- 0.16. These
values indicate significant lumpiness among the young stellar structures. In
addition, the surface density distribution of the identified structures follows
a log-normal distribution. These features are strikingly similar to those of
the turbulent interstellar medium, thus supporting the scenario of hierarchical
star formation regulated by supersonic turbulence.

**TL;DR**: 本研究利用JWST对IC 348星团进行了更深入的褐矮星调查，发现了39个候选褐矮星，其中9个被确认为星团成员，并提出了一个新的光谱分类"H"，以表征烃类吸收特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 先前的研究利用JWST在IC 348星团中心发现了三颗新的褐矮星，其中一颗质量仅为3-4倍木星质量，是光谱学确认的最小质量褐矮星之一。此外，其中两颗褐矮星显示出未预测的烃类吸收特征。

Data: 本研究使用了JWST的NIRCam图像和NIRSpec光谱数据，分析了IC 348星团中的褐矮星候选体。

Method: 通过JWST的NIRCam进行深场观测，并结合NIRSpec光谱分析，对褐矮星候选体进行了分类和研究。

Result: 研究发现39个褐矮星候选体，其中9个被确认为星团成员，质量低至约2倍木星质量。此外，多个褐矮星显示出烃类吸收特征，并提出了新的光谱分类"H"。

Abstract: In a previous study, we used JWST to identify three new brown dwarfs in the
center of a nearby star-forming cluster, IC 348. The faintest object had an
estimated mass of 3-4 $M_{\rm Jup}$, making it a contender for the least
massive brown dwarf confirmed with spectroscopy. Two of the new brown dwarfs
also exhibited absorption features from an unidentified aliphatic hydrocarbon,
which were not predicted by atmospheric models and were not previously detected
in atmospheres outside of the solar system. We have used JWST to perform a
deeper survey for brown dwarfs across a larger field in IC 348. We have
identified 39 brown dwarf candidates in NIRCam images and have obtained spectra
for 15 of them with NIRSpec, nine of which are classified as substellar members
of the cluster. The faintest new members have mass estimates of $\sim2$ $M_{\rm
Jup}$, providing a new constraint on the minimum mass of the IMF. Two new
members ($\sim2$ and 10 $M_{\rm Jup}$) exhibit large excess emission from
circumstellar disks, demonstrating that they harbor the raw materials for
planet formation. Finally, eight of the nine new brown dwarfs and one known
member that is newly observed with NIRSpec show the aforementioned hydrocarbon
features. Among the total of 11 brown dwarfs in IC 348 that have hydrocarbon
detections, the features are stronger at fainter magnitudes, indicating that
the hydrocarbon is a natural constituent of the atmospheres of the coolest
newborn brown dwarfs. We propose a new spectral class "H" that is defined by
the presence of the 3.4 $\mu$m fundamental band of the hydrocarbon.

**TL;DR**: 研究利用JWST的JADES调查数据，结合物理模型和模拟方法，成功约束了高红移（z≥1.5）原球状星系（proto-spheroids）的物理性质，并验证了JWST在探测低质量系统和恒星质量估计方面的可靠性。

Background: 当前对高红移（z≥1.5）原球状星系（proto-spheroids）的物理性质研究存在局限性，尤其是对低质量系统的探测能力不足。JWST的JADES调查结合多波段数据（如Hubble、Spitzer和Herschel）为这一领域提供了新的研究机会。

Data: 使用了JWST的JADES调查数据，并结合Spitzer/MIPS和Herschel的光度数据，以及ASTRODEEP数据中的NIRCam颜色标准。

Method: 采用了物理模型模拟原球状星系的演化，结合JWST的光度测量和SED拟合工具CIGALE，分析了恒星质量、恒星形成率（SFR）、尘埃光度和尘埃质量。

Result: 研究表明，JWST能够以0.1 dex的精度估计高红移原球状星系的恒星质量，并成功探测到宇宙正午时期的低质量系统，验证了模拟与观测数据的一致性。

Abstract: We investigated how well the physical properties of progenitors of
present-day massive spheroidal galaxies (proto-spheroids) can be constrained by
the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) in the GOODS-South field,
which benefits from extensive photometric and spectroscopic data, including
those from the Hubble, Spitzer and Herschel. We adopted a physical model for
the evolution of proto-spheroidal galaxies, which form the bulk of dusty
star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at z>=1.5 and confirmed its consistency with
recent mid-infrared high-z galaxy luminosity functions. Using the model and the
JADES survey strategy, we simulated a sample of proto-spheroids over 87.5
arcmin^2, matching the JADES/GOODS-S survey area. Photometric redshifts
estimated from simulated JWST photometry showed >=95% accuracy and were used in
SED fitting with CIGALE. We demonstrated that JWST will provide reliable
stellar mass estimates up to 0.1 dex for the majority of proto-spheroids at
z>=1.5 and can detect low-mass systems during cosmic noon that were
inaccessible in the pre-JWST era. Focusing on the active star-forming phase of
the proto-spheroid evolution, we defined a sub-sample flux limited at 250
micron (DSFG sample) and derived SFR, dust luminosity and dust mass
complementing the JWST photometry with that from Spitzer/MIPS and Herschel. We
also constructed a JWST-selected DSFG catalog from ASTRODEEP data using NIRCam
colour criteria and demonstrated strong consistency between the observed and
simulated DSFG populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 天体物理结构通常假设为流体静力学平衡，但实际结构可能偏离完美球形或各向同性，暗物质结构（如暗星和暗物质晕）也可能表现出各向异性。轴子类粒子（ALPs）是暗物质的候选者，暗物质晕可能源于玻色子凝聚态中的引力坍缩。

Data: 本研究未明确提及具体数据来源，但基于理论模型（如Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson方程和Bohm-de Broglie方法）进行分析。

Method: 采用Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson方程和Bohm-de Broglie方法，推导了广义的Lane-Emden类方程，分析了静态各向异性玻色星的非最小引力耦合。

Result: 研究发现，对于量子多方体（量子势主导平衡条件），各向异性因子和引力场的作用与经典情况相反，从而形成了一类新的流体静力学平衡天体。

Abstract: The structure of astrophysical objects is usually modeled under the
assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. However, actual configurations may
deviate from perfect spherical or isotropic properties. Consequently, cosmic
objects are expected to exhibit some degree of anisotropy. This consideration
also extends to hypothetical dark structures, such as dark stars and dark
matter halos. Although the nature of dark matter remains unknown, axion-like
particles (ALPs) are strong candidates, suggesting that dark matter halos may
have originated from bosonic configurations undergoing gravitational collapse,
sustained by boson-boson interactions in the condensate state. This system is
described by the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equation. Furthermore, within the
framework of the Bohm-de Broglie approach, quantum effects,encapsulated in the
so-called quantum potential, may play a significant role in equilibrium
astrophysical configurations. In this study, we examine a class of static
anisotropic boson stars which are non-minimally coupled to gravity. By
including all these factors, we derive a generalized Lane-Emden-like equation
and conduct a detailed analysis of the maximum degree of anisotropy that such
systems can sustain, thereby identifying physically viable equilibrium
configurations. Apart from focusing on the impact of anisotropic contributions,
we find that for the so-called Quantum Polytropes (when the quantum potential
is the main responsible for the equilibrium condition), the anisotropic factor
and the gravitational field have opposite roles compared to the classical case.
This leads to a new class of hydrostatic equilibrium objects.

*Mark A. Hollands,Ken. J. Shen,Roberto Raddi,Boris T. Gaensicke,Evan B. Bauer,Alberto Rebassa-Mansergas*

**TL;DR**: SDSSJ163712.21+363155.9 is identified as a hyper-runaway star ejected from a thermonuclear supernova, with its composition and kinematics supporting a dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6) type Ia supernova origin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The star was first identified from its unusual spectrum in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, showing redshifted oxygen, magnesium, and silicon lines, suggesting an ejection from a thermonuclear supernova.

Data: Data includes GTC OSIRIS spectroscopy of SDSSJ1637+3631, Gaia parallax, and photometric information.

Method: The study uses spectroscopic analysis to determine atmospheric composition and surface gravity, and constructs a kinematic model combining astrometric, spectroscopic, and photometric data, along with the Milky Way's gravitational potential.

Result: The star's composition and kinematics support its origin from a D6 type Ia supernova, with an ejection speed of 1870 km/s and a flight time of 4.5 Myr, localizing the ejection site to the inner Galactic disc.

Abstract: SDSSJ163712.21+363155.9 is a candidate hyper-runaway star, first identified
from its unusual spectrum in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which exhibits
oxygen, magnesium, and silicon lines redshifted by several $100\,$km/s, leading
to the suggestion it was ejected from a thermonuclear supernova. We have
acquired GTC OSIRIS spectroscopy of SDSSJ1637+3631 establishing a warm
($T_\mathrm{eff}=15680\pm250\,$K) carbon+oxygen dominated atmosphere, that is
also abundant in the intermediate mass elements silicon, sulphur, and calcium.
We interpret SDSSJ1637+3631 as the donor to an accreting white dwarf that
exploded in a dynamically-driven double-degenerate double-detonation (D6) type
Ia supernova, where the current composition is consistent with a CO white dwarf
core, enriched with intermediate mass elements from deposited supernova ejecta.
While SDSSJ1637+3631 has a low-precision Gaia parallax, our spectroscopic
surface gravity ($\log g=6.3\pm0.3\,$dex) helps constrain its tangential
velocity to $1950^{+810}_{-530}\,$km/s, providing additional support to the D6
mechanism. Under the assumption that SDSSJ1637+3631 is a D6 survivor, we
construct a kinematic model combining all astrometric, spectroscopic, and
photometric information, but also including the structure and gravitational
potential of the Milky Way. Our model localises the ejection site to the inner
few kpc of the Galactic disc (though excluding the Galactic centre), with an
ejection speed of $1870^{+360}_{-300}\,$km/s, and a $4.5^{+0.4}_{-0.5}\,$Myr
time of flight.

Background: 异常造父变星（ACs）是金属贫乏的脉动恒星（[Fe/H]<-1.5），与经典造父变星（CCs）和天琴RR型变星相比研究较少。它们遵循独特的PL和PW关系，并以基模（F）或第一泛音（1O）模式脉动。本研究旨在评估ACs作为距离指标的精度和准确性，并探索其建立独立距离尺度的潜力。

Data: 研究使用了来自VISTA麦哲伦云系统巡天（VMC，2009-2018）的近红外时间序列测光数据（Y、J和Ks波段），以及Gaia DR3和OGLE-IV的光学测光数据，覆盖了约200颗麦哲伦云中的ACs。

Method: 研究通过自定义光变曲线模板推导了118颗大麦哲伦云（LMC）和75颗小麦哲伦云（SMC）ACs的精确强度平均星等，并利用这些数据推导了多波段的PL和PW关系，校准基于食双星的几何距离。

Result: 研究发现PL关系的斜率随波长增加而增加，弥散度减小。利用Gaia视差确定了LMC的距离模数和LMC-SMC的相对距离，并确认了银河系球状星团中几颗新候选ACs的性质，推导出Draco dSph星系的距离模数为19.425±0.048星等。与天琴RR型变星的距离存在0.1星等的差异，可能反映了金属丰度效应。

Abstract: Anomalous Cepheids (ACs) are less studied metal-poor pulsating stars
([Fe/H]<-1.5) compared to Classical Cepheids (CCs) and RR Lyrae stars. They
follow distinct Period-Luminosity (PL) and Period-Wesenheit (PW) relations and
pulsate in either the fundamental (F) or first overtone (1O) mode. Our goal is
to assess the precision and accuracy of AC-based distances and evaluate their
potential for establishing an independent distance scale. We derive new PL and
PW relations for F-mode, 1O-mode, and, for the first time, combined F+1O ACs in
the Magellanic Clouds. We study their wavelength dependence and apply the
relations to estimate distances to Local Group stellar systems hosting ACs,
while also confirming AC classifications. Our analysis is based on
near-infrared time-series photometry in the Y, J, and Ks bands for about 200
ACs in the Magellanic Clouds from the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds
system (VMC, 2009-2018). VMC data are complemented with optical photometry from
Gaia DR3 and OGLE-IV, which also provide periods and pulsation modes. Custom
light-curve templates were used to derive precise intensity-averaged magnitudes
for 118 ACs in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and 75 in the Small Magellanic
Cloud. These data were used to derive multi-band PL and PW relations,
calibrated using the geometric LMC distance from eclipsing binaries. We find
that PL relation slopes increase and dispersions decrease with wavelength.
Using Gaia parallaxes, we determine the LMC distance modulus and the LMC-SMC
relative distance. We also confirm the AC nature of several new candidates in
Galactic Globular Clusters and derive a distance modulus for the Draco dSph
galaxy of 19.425+/-0.048 mag. A 0.1 mag discrepancy with RR Lyrae-based
distances may reflect metallicity effects. Future spectroscopic surveys and
Gaia DR4 will help refine the AC distance scale and quantify metallicity
impacts.

Background: HD 21278是年轻的α Persei开放星团中最亮的主序星之一，研究旨在通过分析其光谱和干涉数据，进一步了解双星系统和星团的性质。

Data: 使用了新的光谱数据和存档的光谱数据，以及CHARA阵列在威尔逊山获取的干涉数据。

Method: 分析了新的和存档的光谱数据以测量径向速度曲线，并利用CHARA阵列的干涉数据测量了双星的位置和轨道倾角。

Result: 确定了双星的质量分别为5.381±0.084太阳质量和3.353±0.064太阳质量，星团年龄为49±7 Myr（PARSEC模型）或49.5±6 Myr（MIST模型），并对大质量白矮星的初始-最终质量关系提出了挑战。

Abstract: We present a study of the double-lined spectroscopic binary HD 21278 that
contains one of the brightest main sequence stars in the young $\alpha$ Persei
open cluster. We analyzed new spectra and reanalyzed archived spectra to
measure precise new radial velocity curves for the binary. We also obtained
interferometric data using the CHARA Array at Mount Wilson to measure the sky
positions of the two stars and the inclination of the $\sim$ 2 milliarcsecond
orbit. We determine that the two stars have masses of $5.381 \pm 0.084
M_{\odot}$ and $3.353 \pm 0.064 M_{\odot}$. From isochrone fits, we find the
cluster's age to be $49 \pm 7$ Myr (using PARSEC models) or $49.5 \pm 6$ Myr
(MIST models). Finally, we revisit the massive white dwarfs that are candidate
escapees from the $\alpha$ Persei cluster to try to better characterize the
massive end of the white dwarf initial-final mass relation. The implied
progenitor masses challenge the idea that Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs are
made by single stars with masses near $8 \msun$.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 超大质量黑洞（SMBHs）在宇宙早期形成以及高红移星系中氮氧丰度比异常高的现象挑战了现有理论，而超质量恒星（SMSs）被认为是解释这些现象的有力候选者，但现有模型忽略了恒星旋转的关键作用。

Data: 研究使用了GENEC恒星演化代码模拟的数据。

Method: 研究采用GENEC恒星演化代码，详细处理了旋转引起的化学混合、角动量传输以及由OmegaGamma极限驱动的质量损失。

Result: 旋转显著扩大了SMSs的对流核心并延长了恒星寿命达20%，同时发现SMSs核心旋转速度较慢（低于200 km/s），导致中等质量黑洞（IMBH）残余的自旋参数a*小于0.1，远低于理论最大值。

Abstract: The detection of billion-solar-mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within
the first billion years of cosmic history challenges conventional theories of
black hole formation and growth. Simultaneously, recent JWST observations
revealing exceptionally high nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios in galaxies at
high redshifts raise critical questions about rapid chemical enrichment
mechanisms operating in the early universe. Supermassive stars (SMSs) with
masses of 1000 to 10000 M$_{\odot}$ are promising candidates to explain these
phenomena, but existing models have so far neglected the pivotal role of
stellar rotation. Here, we present the first comprehensive evolutionary models
of rotating Pop III SMSs computed using the GENEC stellar evolution code,
including detailed treatments of rotation-induced chemical mixing, angular
momentum transport, and mass loss driven by the $\Omega\Gamma$ limit. We
demonstrate that rotation significantly enlarges the convective core and
extends stellar lifetimes by up to 20%, with moderate enhancement of mass-loss
rates as stars approach critical rotation thresholds. Our results further
indicate that the cores of SMSs rotate relatively slowly (below $\sim 200$ km
s$^{-1}$), resulting in dimensionless spin parameters $a* < 0.1$ for
intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) remnants that are notably lower than
theoretical maximum spins. These findings highlight rotation as a key factor in
determining the structural evolution, chemical yields, and black hole spin
properties of SMSs, providing critical insights to interpret observational
signatures from the high-redshift universe.

### [32] [An environmental analysis of supernova iPTF13bvn with HST and MUSE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08099)
*Adam J. Singleton,Justyn R. Maund,Ning-Chen Sun*

**TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种结合光度学恒星群拟合和积分场单元光谱分析的方法，研究了超新星iPTF13bvn的环境，支持其前身星为双星系统的结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 过去对超新星前身星的研究依赖于爆炸前的直接探测，本文提出了一种新的方法，通过结合光度学恒星群拟合和积分场单元光谱分析，全面探索超新星环境并约束前身星性质。

Data: 使用了HST/WFC3的观测数据和VLT/MUSE的积分场单元光谱数据。

Method: 结合光度学恒星群拟合和积分场单元光谱分析，对超新星iPTF13bvn的环境进行了研究。

Result: 研究发现iPTF13bvn的环境包含两个恒星群，支持其前身星为双星系统，并表明双星系统可能是Ib型超新星前身星的主要质量损失机制。

Abstract: Searches for supernovae (SNe) progenitors have relied on a direct detection
of the star in fortuitous pre-explosion images. We propose an alternative
method, using a combination of photometric stellar population fitting alongside
integral-field-unit (IFU) spectroscopic analysis of the ionised gas to fully
explore the SN environment and constrain the progenitor properties. Isochrone
fitting of HST/WFC3 observations reveals the environment of iPTF13bvn contains
two stellar populations with unique age ($\tau=\log{t [years]}$) and extinction
($A_V$) values, with the closest agreement found between past progenitor
studies of iPTF13bvn and our oldest stellar population (P2):
$\tau_{P2}=6.97^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$, a corresponding initial mass $M_{initial,P2}
= 20.0 M_\odot$ and $A_{V,P2}=0.53^{+0.10}_{-0.08}$ mag. Further analysis with
VLT/MUSE IFU-spectroscopic observations reveals no bright H II regions
associated with iPTF13bvn, suggesting no immediate ongoing star formation.
Extinctions derived from the ionised gas are a minimum of ~2.5 times higher
than the resolved stellar population values, assisting in building a 3D picture
of the environment. An analysis of the distribution of spaxel extinctions
reveals increased variability in the environment of iPTF13bvn, on the edge of a
spiral arm. Our study highlights the complex relationship between stars, gas
and dust and how, when used in a holistic environmental analysis, they can
begin to resolve degeneracies that have plagued past progenitor investigations.
Specifically for iPTF13bvn, our results support a binary progenitor and a
growing consensus for binarity as the predominant mass-loss mechanism for Type
Ib SNe progenitors.

### [33] [Measuring monster MBHs: maybe mighty, maybe merely massive](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08108)
*M. Gliozzi,A. Akylas,J. K. Williams,I. E. Papadakis*

**TL;DR**: 本研究通过比较X射线标度法和单历元法对高红移类星体和高度吸积活动星系核的黑洞质量测量，发现两种方法在大多数情况下一致，但对高度吸积或显著吸收的AGN存在偏差，并对早期宇宙中超大质量黑洞的极端增长条件提出质疑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 高红移星系中黑洞质量的准确测量对限制超大质量黑洞的增长和区分不同黑洞种子模型至关重要。然而，现有研究通常通过间接方法（如单历元法）进行估算，这些方法在本地宇宙中适用于中等吸积、低光度AGN，但在高红移宇宙中的可靠性尚不明确。

Data: 研究使用了高光度遥远类星体和高度吸积AGN的样本数据。

Method: 研究采用了X射线标度法和单历元法（SE）进行黑洞质量测量，并对两种方法的结果进行了系统性比较。

Result: 研究发现X射线标度法和单历元法在大多数情况下结果一致，但对显著吸收的AGN（单历元法低估）和远高于爱丁顿极限吸积的AGN（单历元法高估）存在偏差。此外，研究还发现一个常用AGN目录的黑洞质量值被系统性低估了2.5倍，可能导致误导性结论。研究还确认了Gamma与lambda_Edd、X射线玻色校正与lambda_Edd以及Gamma与软过剩强度之间的强正相关性。

Abstract: Accurate black hole mass (MBH) measurements in high-z galaxies are difficult
yet crucial to constrain the growth of supermassive BHs, and to discriminate
between competing BH seed models. Recent studies claimed the detection of
massive BHs in very distant AGN, implying extreme growth conditions. However,
these estimates are usually obtained by extrapolating indirect methods that are
calibrated for moderately accreting, low-luminosity AGN in the local universe.
To assess the reliability of the single epoch method (SE) in the distant
universe, we compute the MBH for a sample of hyper-luminous distant quasars and
a sample of highly accreting AGN using the X-ray scaling method. We first
verify that this X-ray method yields reliable MBH values for distant highly
accreting objects. Then, we carry out a systematic comparison with the SE
method and find that these two indirect methods yield consistent MBH over a
broad range of luminosities, intrinsic absorption, and accretion rates. The
only discrepancies are associated with AGN that are substantially absorbed
(underestimated by the SE method), and AGN accreting well above the Eddington
limit (overestimated by the SE method). The latter result casts some doubts on
the claim of overmassive BHs in highly accreting AGN in the early universe. Our
study also reveals that one of the frequently used AGN catalogs consistently
underestimates the MBH values by a factor of 2.5. Although this factor is of
the order of the uncertainty generally associated with the SE method, we
demonstrate that the use of underestimated values may result in potentially
misleading conclusions. Specifically, for this AGN sample we confirm strong
positive correlations for Gamma vs. lambda_Edd and for the X-ray bolometric
correction vs. lambda_Edd, as well as for Gamma vs. the soft excess strength,
at odds with the conclusions inferred using underestimated MBH values.

Abstract: In this new era of time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, various new
transients and new phenomena are constantly being discovered thanks to the
rapid advances in observations, which provide the excellent opportunity to
study the physics in the extreme environments. The enhanced X-ray Timing and
Polarimetry mission (eXTP), planned to be launched in 2030, has several key
advantages, including advanced polarimetry, high sensitivity & large effective
area, and wide energy range coverage, which make it a groundbreaking project in
high-energy astrophysics. In this article, we briefly introduce the potential
time-domain and multi-messenger targets for eXTP, including gravitational-wave
(GW) counterparts, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), magnetars and fast radio bursts
(FRBs), tidal disruption events (TDEs), supernovae, high energy neutrinos and
TeV active galactic nucleus (AGNs), and so on. We discuss the advantages of
future eXTP observations for detecting these sources, their detection
capabilities, the abilities to distinguish theoretical models, and their
applications in gravity and cosmology.

*K. E. Saavik Ford,Barry McKernan*

**TL;DR**: 通过研究双黑洞合并及其引力波和电磁波特性，可以反推活动星系核盘和核星团的性质，并验证相关模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 活动星系核（AGN）由星系中心的超大质量黑洞吸积盘驱动，对超大质量黑洞及其宿主星系的演化起重要作用，但目前AGN和核星团的性质仍高度不确定。

Data: 研究利用双黑洞合并的引力波和电磁波数据。

Method: 通过分析双黑洞合并的质量谱、自旋分布以及合并率随红移的变化，反推AGN盘和核星团的性质。

Result: 研究发现双黑洞合并的质量谱特征和自旋分布是验证AGN模型的有效工具，合并率随红移的变化与AGN数量密度相关，且AGN驱动的双黑洞合并比例可用于推断高红移AGN盘和核星团的平均性质。

Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are powered by accretion disks onto supermassive
black holes in the the centers of galaxies. AGN are believed to play important
roles in the evolution of both supermassive black holes and their host galaxies
over cosmic time. AGN and the nuclear star clusters (NSCs) that interact with
them remain unresolved with present and planned telescopes. As a result, the
properties of AGN and NSCs are highly uncertain. Here we review how binary
black hole (BBH) mergers can occur in AGN disks and how both the gravitational
wave (GW) and electromagnetic wave (EM) properties of such mergers allow us to
reverse-engineer the properties of AGN disks and NSCs over cosmic time. We
point out that the feature in the BBH mass spectrum around $\sim 35M_{\odot}$
is an excellent probe of hierarchical merger models. Likewise constraints on
the spins of upper-mass gap BH ($\gtrsim 50M_{\odot}$) test the AGN channel.
The effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$) distribution, including asymmetry,
islands of structure and magnitudes are excellent tests of AGN model
predictions. We also argue, that the rate of AGN-driven BBH mergers as a
function of redshift should scale slightly shallower than the AGN number
density, at least out to redshifts of $\sim 2$, and should turnover at the same
redshift as the AGN number density. Finally, we emphasize a determination of an
AGN fraction of observed BBH mergers ($f_{\rm BBH,AGN}$), \emph{regardless of
the actual value}, allows us to infer the average properties of AGN disks and
NSCs out to high redshift.

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过符号回归方法构建了重子物理对物质功率谱影响的解析近似表达式，并提供了不同重子物理模型的预测不确定性分析。


<details>

Background: 重子物理在当前和未来宇宙学调查所探测的尺度上对物质分布有显著影响，是此类分析中的关键系统误差来源。

Data: 使用了来自CAMELS流体动力学模拟套件（包括Astrid、IllustrisTNG、SIMBA和Swift-EAGLE）的数据，以及一种重子化算法的数据。

Method: 采用符号回归方法构建了重子物理对物质功率谱影响的解析近似表达式，并分析了预测的不确定性。

Result: 研究得到的解析近似表达式在流体动力学模拟中的误差与初始条件变化引起的样本方差相当，重子化表达式的均方根误差小于1%（小尺度上误差增加）。这些表达式具有物理上正确的大尺度和高红移行为，可用于区分不同重子物理模型。

Abstract: Baryonic physics has a considerable impact on the distribution of matter in
our Universe on scales probed by current and future cosmological surveys,
acting as a key systematic in such analyses. We seek simple symbolic
parametrisations for the impact of baryonic physics on the matter power
spectrum for a range of physically motivated models, as a function of
wavenumber, redshift, cosmology, and parameters controlling the baryonic
feedback. We use symbolic regression to construct analytic approximations for
the ratio of the matter power spectrum in the presence of baryons to that
without such effects. We obtain separate functions of each of four distinct
sub-grid prescriptions of baryonic physics from the CAMELS suite of
hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, IllustrisTNG, SIMBA and Swift-EAGLE) as
well as for a baryonification algorithm. We also provide functions which
describe the uncertainty on these predictions, due to both the stochastic
nature of baryonic physics and the errors on our fits. The error on our
approximations to the hydrodynamical simulations is comparable to the sample
variance estimated through varying initial conditions, and our baryonification
expression has a root mean squared error of better than one percent, although
this increases on small scales. These errors are comparable to those of
previous numerical emulators for these models. Our expressions are enforced to
have the physically correct behaviour on large scales and at high redshift. Due
to their analytic form, we are able to directly interpret the impact of varying
cosmology and feedback parameters, and we can identify parameters which have
little to no effect. Each function is based on a different implementation of
baryonic physics, and can therefore be used to discriminate between these
models when applied to real data. We provide publicly available code for all
symbolic approximations found.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系团的动力学和结构研究对于理解宇宙大尺度结构和暗物质分布至关重要，但目前对星系团边缘（如溅落半径）的详细研究仍有限。

Data: 使用暗能量巡天第三年数据和ROSAT全天巡天多成分匹配滤波器星系团的X射线数据。

Method: 通过测量RedMaGiC高密度星系与星系团的投影互相关信号，以及弱引力透镜信号，推断3D数密度分布和晕质量。

Result: 发现星系团边缘的数密度分布显著变陡，溅落半径为2.19（误差范围+0.50/-0.43）h^{-1} Mpc，与ΛCDM模型预测一致，并首次推断出星系团的平均质量吸积率。

Abstract: We present measurements of the radial profile of mass and galaxy number
density around X-ray selected ROSAT All Sky Survey-Multi-Component Matched
Filter galaxy clusters using Year 3 data from the Dark Energy Survey. We
measure the projected cross-correlation signal of the RedMaGiC "high density"
galaxies around an approximately volume-limited sample of 255 galaxy clusters
at a median redshift of $z=0.4$ and an X-ray luminosity $L_X > 10^{44}
\,\text{ergs} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{h}^{-2}$. This cross-correlation signal
measured with a signal-to-noise ratio of 16.41 allows us to infer a 3D number
density profile which shows a significant steepening at the edges of these
galaxy clusters, namely the splashback radius of $r_{sp}$ /$h^{-1}
\mathrm{M_{\odot}} = 2.19^{+0.50}_{-0.43}$. We present the dependence of the
splashback radius value over a range of absolute galaxy magnitude cuts to look
for any evidence of dynamical friction affecting these results. The weak
lensing signal around our galaxy clusters measured with a signal-to-noise ratio
of 32.19 allows us to infer a halo mass $\text{log} (M_{\rm 200m} / h^{-1}
\text{Mpc}) = 14.68_{-0.04}^{+0.04}$. Comparison of the location of the
splashback radius with the spherical overdensity boundary $r_{\rm 200m}$ shows
consistency with the $\mathrm{\Lambda CDM}$ predictions. We present the first
inference of the average mass accretion rate of galaxy clusters using our
measurements of the splashback radius.

**TL;DR**: 通过交叉关联快速射电暴（FRBs）的色散与前景星系的位置，首次明确检测到FRB色散测量与宇宙结构之间的空间相关性，揭示了星系形成反馈过程对等离子体分布的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 快速射电暴（FRBs）的色散可以作为探测星系间和周围弥散等离子体的有力工具，这些等离子体包含了宇宙中大部分的重子物质。通过研究FRB色散与星系位置的关联，可以了解等离子体与星系在0.1到50 Mpc尺度上的空间分布，这些尺度受星系形成反馈过程的强烈影响。

Data: 使用了来自第二次CHIME/FRB目录的2873个FRB和来自暗能量光谱仪（DESI）Legacy Imaging Survey的近600万个星系的数据。

Method: 通过测量FRB色散与星系角交叉功率谱，分析了0.05 < z < 0.5范围内五个光度学星系红移分区的数据。

Result: 首次在5.1σ显著性水平上检测到FRB色散测量与宇宙结构之间的空间相关性，发现等离子体-星系交叉功率谱在尺度k_cut^{-1}=0.9^{+0.4}_{-0.4} Mpc处相对于物质功率谱截断，表明反馈过程导致群质量暗物质晕中的重子物质被大量排出。

Abstract: The dispersion of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) can serve as a
powerful probe of the diffuse plasma between and surrounding galaxies, which
contains most of the Universe's baryons. By cross-correlating the dispersion of
background FRBs with the locations of foreground galaxies, we can study the
relative spatial distributions of plasma and galaxies on scales of 0.1 to 50
Mpc, which are strongly affected by feedback processes in galaxy formation.
Here we present the measurement of the dispersion$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy
angular cross-power spectrum between 2873 FRBs from the Second CHIME/FRB
Catalog and nearly 6 million galaxies from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Survey. Over five photometric galaxy redshift
bins spanning $0.05 < z <0.5$ and at 5.1$\sigma$ significance, we make the
first definitive detection of spatial correlations in FRB dispersion measure
due to cosmic structure. While parameter inferences should be interpreted with
caution because of incomplete modelling of both the signal and systematic
errors, our data indicate that the plasma$\unicode{x2013}$galaxy cross-power
spectrum cuts off relative to the matter power spectrum at a scale
$k_\textrm{cut}^{-1}=0.9^{+0.4}_{-0.4}\,\textrm{Mpc}$. This scale is consistent
with those X-ray stacking analyses that suggest dark-matter halos with
group-scale masses are largely evacuated of their baryons by feedback
processes. Our study demonstrates that FRBs are promising tools to discern the
physics of baryonic structure formation and will only become more powerful as
FRB surveys expand.
