FLAMINGO combines a $(1\\,\\mathrm{cGpc})^3$ volume with baryonic resolution sufficient to identify ${\\gtrsim}\\,10^3$ independent JWST-like survey volumes of $(100\\,\\mathrm{cMpc})^3$, providing unprecedented statistics to characterize the extremes of cosmic variance.

Similarly, at $z\\,{\\gtrsim}\\,4$, the variance in the most massive halo per JWST-like field is twice the Poisson prediction. We find a pronounced large-scale \\emph{conformity}: in volumes ranked by the stellar mass of their most massive galaxy ($M_{\\ast,\\mathrm{max}}$), the stellar-to-halo mass relation and star-formation efficiency are coherently elevated or suppressed throughout the full $(100\\,\\mathrm{cMpc})^3$ volume. When accounting for galaxies outside the volume, this signal persists only to radii $\\lesssim 50\\,\\mathrm{cMpc}$, demonstrating that the detectable conformity is enhanced by the survey footprint. Moreover, $M_{\\ast,\\mathrm{max}}$ is a better predictor of the volume-wide efficiency of massive galaxies than the total number counts, which mainly trace clustering.

These results show that both cosmic variance and footprint-confined conformity must be modelled when interpreting early massive galaxy populations in JWST fields."}

SEEDZ includes models for Population III star formation, supernovae explosions and the resulting formation of light seed black holes, metal enrichment and subsequent Population II star formation, heavy seed black hole formation, Eddington and super-Eddington accretion schemes as well as black hole feedback. In this paper, we cover the overall methodologies employed and present our current results at $z=15$. Our main result so far is that black holes initially grow faster than their host galaxy, and hence over-massive black holes are a feature of the high-redshift Universe. The fundamental black hole-galaxy relationships we observe at $z = 0$ (especially the M$_{\\rm BH}$ - M$_*$ relationship) likely only emerge in more mature galaxies. At high-redshift, that relationship has not yet been established. We find that even at these high redshifts, MBHs can grow from their initial heavy seed mass of $\\sim$10$^4$ M$_\\odot$ up to 10$^6$ M$_\\odot$. At the high end of our MBH masses, our simulated galaxy M$_{\\rm BH}$ - M$_*$ relations match the observed high redshift trends i.e. over-massive BHs with M$_{\\rm BH}$/M$_{\\rm star} \\sim 10^{-2}$. This initial set of simulations will continue to run down to $z=10$, where we will perform a comprehensive comparison of simulated MBH number densities and M$_{\\rm BH}$ - M$_*$ relations with JWST observations.

Only one of the off-nuclear radio sources has a significant optical counterpart and we present Palomar spectroscopy that identifies this object as a background AGN. We cannot definitively determine if the seven remaining off-nuclear radio sources are wandering massive BHs in the target dwarf galaxies or background AGNs, although the three sources with the largest offsets have compact radio cores detected with the Very Large Baseline Array and are consistent with expectations for background AGNs (Sargent et al 2022).

However, these metrics can be biased by changes in imaging quality - resolution and depth - either across the survey area or the sample. To prepare for the upcoming Rubin LSST data, we investigate this bias for all metrics measured by statmorph and single-component Sérsic fitting with Galfit. We find that geometrical measurements (ellipticity, axis ratio, Petrosian radius, and effective radius) are fairly robust at most depths and resolutions. Light concentration measurements ($C$, Gini, $M_{20}$) systematically decrease with resolution, leading low-mass or high-redshift bulge-dominated sources to appear indistinguishable from disks. Sérsic index $n$, while unbiased, suffers from a 20-40% uncertainty due to degeneracies in the Sérsic fit. Disturbance measurements ($A$, $A_S$, $D$) depend on signal-to-noise and are thus affected by noise and surface-brightness dimming. We quantify this dependence for each parameter, offer empirical correction functions, and show that the evolution in $C$ observed in JWST galaxies can be explained purely by observational biases. We propose two new measurements - isophotal asymmetry $A_X$ and substructure $St$ - that aim to resolve some of these biases. Finally, we provide a Python package statmorph-lsst implementing these changes and a full dataset that enables tests of custom functions (see text for links)."}

The TAIGA experiment is a hybrid detector system that combines several imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and an array of non-imaging Cherenkov detectors (TAIGA-HiSCORE) for EAS detection. Because the signals recorded by different detector types differ in physical nature, the direct merging of data is unfeasible, which complicates multimodal analysis. Currently, to analyze data from the IACTs and TAIGA-HiSCORE, a set of auxiliary parameters specific to each detector type is calculated from the recorded signals. These parameters are chosen empirically, so there is no certainty that they retain all important information and are the best suited for the respective problems. We propose to use autoencoders (AE) for the analysis of TAIGA experimental data and replace the conventionally used auxiliary parameters with the parameters of the AE latent space. The advantage of the AE latent space parameters is that they preserve essential physics from experimental data without prior assumptions. This approach also holds potential for enabling seamless integration of heterogeneous IACT and HiSCORE data through a joint latent space. To reconstruct the parameters of the primary particle of the EAS from the latent space of the AE, a separate artificial neural network is used. In this paper, the proposed approach is used to reconstruct the energy of the EAS primary particles based on Monte Carlo simulation data for TAIGA-HiSCORE. The dependence of the energy determination accuracy on the dimensionality of the latent space is analyzed, and these results are also compared with the results obtained by the conventional technique. It is shown that when using the AE latent space, the energy of the primary particle is reconstructed with satisfactory accuracy."}

Standard transport theories rely on the local Fokker-Planck (FP) equation, a formalism restricted to Gaussian processes governed by the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). This approach fails for RR, which is a superdiffusive Lévy flight characterized by non-local transport and governed by the Generalized Central Limit Theorem (GCLT). We apply the space-fractional Fokker-Planck equation (FFPE), utilizing non-local Riemann-Liouville operators, to resolve major discrepancies between local theory and observations. In transient regimes, the FFPE predicts an immediate, linear flux ($Γ(t) \\propto t$), consistent with high Tidal Disruption Event (TDE) rates in post-starburst galaxies, whereas local FP models predict an unphysical exponential delay ($Γ(t) \\propto \\exp(-C/t)$). Furthermore, we prove mathematically that the non-local integral operators permit ``barrier jumping''. This mechanism nullifies transport bottlenecks like the proposed Schwarzschild Barrier (SB). Local models incorrectly interpret the SB as severely suppressing Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspiral (EMRI) rates. We validate our theoretical findings using direct-summation $N$-body simulations incorporating relativistic corrections. The simulations confirm that particle flux remains continuous across the SB in the regime where RR dominates, demonstrating that the barrier does not inhibit EMRI production. The fractional framework provides the correct physical description for non-local transport, resolving long-standing problems concerning TDE and EMRI rates."}

We assume that the SG is formed out of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) ejecta of first-generation stars plus pristine interstellar medium gas which is modelled as a uniform gas moving at a constant velocity towards the cluster. We tested two values for the infalling gas density of 10^(-24) and 10^(23) g/cm^3. Type Ia SNe start to explode together with the release of gas from the most massive AGB stars. Three simulated models are analyzed. In the low-mass and low-density scenario, we find that SNe Ia quench star formation which however restarts when the gas cools down again in between two explosions. SG stars are dominated by a He-rich population (Y>0.33), which is poorly diluted by pristine gas. In the high-mass models, star formation is mildly affected, while the He composition is significantly altered as exploding SNe prevent the accretion of pristine gas and therefore extremely helium-rich stars form. In the high-density model, such weak gas accretion leads to a maximum enhancement in helium mass fraction much larger than the observed one and not correlating with the initial cluster mass as found in models without Type Ia SNe. As for the iron content, small spreads have been found in all models, but the SG is less homogeneous than the FG, at variance with current observations."}

They follow a tight scaling relation of X-ray luminosity with halo mass. However, predicting the dependence of the scatter in this relation on mass and redshift is challenging, due to the statistical requirement of large simulation volumes. Using the large volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulations for galaxy cluster physics FLAMINGO and TNG300+TNG-Cluster, we fit this relation and its scatter, focusing on $M_{\\rm 500c}>10^{13}~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ and $z \\leq 2$. We find qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different results for the two models. For the first time, we study ways to reduce the scatter using properties beyond X-ray luminosity, namely six ICM, six galaxy, and eleven dark matter halo properties. For both FLAMINGO and TNG300+TNG-Cluster, the gas fraction and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal correlate strongest with X-ray scatter, reducing it by over 50% when accounting for their partial correlations. Galaxy and halo properties correlate weakly with X-ray scatter, typically reducing it by 10-20%. Our results are qualitatively robust across different FLAMINGO feedback variations, though the correlations weaken for stronger feedback and with increasing redshift. Differences between FLAMINGO and TNG300+TNG-Cluster are only apparent at the high-mass end - where e.g. the galaxy stellar age correlates strongly for FLAMINGO, but not for TNG300+TNG-Cluster - confirming robustness across physics implementations. We provide fitting formulas for the scatter and its corrections, for direct application to cosmological analyses and observational data."}

Star-forming galaxies are identified using the $g-z$ color, and $F_{\\mathrm{sf}}$ is measured as a function of redshift, cluster halo mass, and galaxy stellar mass. Field galaxies are used as a comparison sample to reduce selection effects.

In contrast, $F_{\\mathrm{sf}}$ decreases with increasing cluster halo mass and BCG stellar mass. At the low stellar mass end, BCGs exhibit higher star-forming fractions than field galaxies, suggesting enhanced star formation likely fueled by cold gas accretion from the intracluster medium. Also, star-forming BCGs tend to show larger projected offsets from the optical cluster density peak than quenching BCGs, indicating ongoing assembly. The analysis of the specific star formation rate (sSFR) further indicates a transition in the dominant mechanism driving star formation in BCGs: cooling flows are likely responsible at low redshift, while gas-rich mergers play a greater role at higher redshift.

As an elementary test, we twenty-one astronomers with varied experience in studying resolved galaxies and circumstances, have each assessed 200 galaxy images, spanning the early phase of bar evolution in two different barred galaxy simulations. We find variations exist within the classification of all the standard bar parameters assessed: bar length, axis-ratio, pitch-angle and even whether a bar is present at all. If this is indicative of the wider community, it has implications for interpreting morphological trends, such as bar-end effects. Furthermore, we find that it is surprisingly not expertise but gender, followed by career stage, which gives rise to the largest discrepancies in the reported bar parameters. Currently, automation does not seem to be a viable solution, with bar classifications from two automated bar-finding algorithms tested and failing to find bars in snapshots where most astronomers agree a bar must exist. Increasing dependence on machine learning or crowdsourcing with a training dataset can only serve to obfuscate any existing biases if these originate from the specific astronomer producing the training material. On the strength of this small sample, we encourage an interim best practice to reduce the impact of any possible classification bias and set goals for the community to resolve the issue in the future."}

The mid-infrared images reveal four sources of continuum emission from hot dust that we identify as luminous HII regions, which are used to define spectral apertures. The dominant continuum source is the pc-scale supernebula core seen at radio wavelengths. We find that the MIR to radio continuum flux ratio for all regions is identical to that of Galactic HII regions. The 9.7 silicate feature is present and strongest in absorption toward the supernebula. Silicate emission is seen in another HII region. PAH features are present, although weak, particularly in the supernebula; the strongest emission is in an HII region only 15 pc from the supernebula core. PAH features at 6.2$μ$m and 11.3$μ$m are detected in all sources.

This paper aims to incorporate machine-learning techniques with a Bayesian inference to improve the accuracy and efficiency of null depth retrieval in nulling interferometry. Specifically, it explores the use of neural posterior estimation (NPE) to develop models that overcome the computational limitations of conventional methods, such as numerical self-calibration (NSC), providing a more robust solution for accurate null depth calibration. An NPE-based model was developed, with a simulator that incorporates real data to better represent specific conditions. The model was tested on both synthetic and observational data from the LBTI nuller for evaluation. The NPE model successfully demonstrated improved efficiency, achieving results comparable to current methods in use. It achieved a null depth retrieval accuracy down to a few $10^{-4}$ on real observational data, matching the performance of conventional approaches while offering significant computational advantages, reducing the data retrieval time to one-quarter of the time required by self-calibration methods. The NPE model presents a practical and scalable solution for null depth calibration in nulling interferometry, offering substantial improvements in efficiency over existing methods with a better precision and application to other interferometric techniques."}

In this work, we investigate a warm inflation model with a quartic potential and a composite dissipation coefficient $Υ(φ, T) = C_1 \\frac{T^3}{M_{\\text{Pl}}^2} + C_2 \\frac{T^3}{φ^2}.$ The two terms in $Υ$ dominate at different scales: the first term governs the early inflationary dynamics at large (CMB) scales, while the second term becomes significant at smaller scales. The model features two distinct stages of inflation: an initial phase where strong dissipation ($Q \\gg 1$) generates a red-tilted primordial spectrum consistent with CMB observations (from ACT), followed by a second phase producing a blue-tilted spectrum with a significant amplification of power at small scales, leading to primordial black hole formation. We analyze the effects of key parameters -- like the duration of each inflationary phase, the slow-roll parameter at the end of the first phase, the dissipation strength at the pivot scale, and the choice of the growth function -- on the primordial power spectrum and its spectral index. Additionally, we examine the consistency of the model with the swampland distance conjecture and trans-Planckian conjecture, needed for embedding these models with some UV complete theories.

However, these metrics can be biased by changes in imaging quality - resolution and depth - either across the survey area or the sample. To prepare for the upcoming Rubin LSST data, we investigate this bias for all metrics measured by statmorph and single-component Sérsic fitting with Galfit. We find that geometrical measurements (ellipticity, axis ratio, Petrosian radius, and effective radius) are fairly robust at most depths and resolutions. Light concentration measurements ($C$, Gini, $M_{20}$) systematically decrease with resolution, leading low-mass or high-redshift bulge-dominated sources to appear indistinguishable from disks. Sérsic index $n$, while unbiased, suffers from a 20-40% uncertainty due to degeneracies in the Sérsic fit. Disturbance measurements ($A$, $A_S$, $D$) depend on signal-to-noise and are thus affected by noise and surface-brightness dimming. We quantify this dependence for each parameter, offer empirical correction functions, and show that the evolution in $C$ observed in JWST galaxies can be explained purely by observational biases. We propose two new measurements - isophotal asymmetry $A_X$ and substructure $St$ - that aim to resolve some of these biases. Finally, we provide a Python package statmorph-lsst implementing these changes and a full dataset that enables tests of custom functions (see text for links)."}

Abstract abridged", "summary": "Context: The Milky Way contains a thick and a thin disc that differ in chemical, kinematic, structural, and spatial properties. There is significant overlap in the distributions of these properties, especially so at higher metallicities. Distinguishing between these major structural components is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of the Galaxy. Multiple selection methods exist to classify stars as thin or thick disc stars, each with its own advantages and limitations. Aims: We investigate how different classification methods for categorising stars into the thick and thin disc populations influence the determination of structural properties of the two discs. Methods: We apply five different selection methods. Two methods use cuts in the [$α$/Fe]-[Fe/H] and [Mg/Mn]-[Al/Fe] planes; one uses a dynamical separation in $J_φ$ -$J_Z$ space; one uses an age-based cut; and the last one uses a kinematic likelihood method. For each method, we derive relative density profiles of each component as functions of height above the Galactic plane and Galactocentric radius, and fit these to a simple two-exponential disc model. We use red giant stars from APOGEE DR17 and stellar ages from astroNN. Results: Methods based on abundance or age data produce the cleanest separations, while kinematic and dynamical methods suffer higher contamination due to difficulties in separating well-mixed populations. The thin disc scale heights show a clear flaring as they increase with radius, while the thick disc stays approximately constant at around 1 kpc over most radii for all methods. All methods find the thin disc to have a longer scale length than the thick disc, with the difference being greatest for the chemical selection methods. A scale length of the thick disc of 2.0 kpc leads to one of between 2.3 and 3.0 kpc for the thin disc."}

The presence of a stellar companion can strongly influence the architecture and long-term stability of planetary systems. Motivated by the discovery of exoplanets exhibiting extremely high eccentricities (e >= 0.8) in systems with a binary companion, we investigate how planetary orbits around one star (S-type configuration) evolve under the gravitational perturbations of the companion. Aims. We aim to assess the role of a stellar companion in shaping the orbital evolution of S-type planets and to explore whether dynamical interactions in such environments can account for the formation of highly eccentric planets. Methods. We performed a suite of N-body simulations, modeling systems initially composed of three Jupiter-mass planets on nearly circular, coplanar orbits around the primary star. We systematically varied the semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination of the stellar companion, to characterize the conditions under which extreme eccentricities can be excited. Results. Our results show that dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering and secular mechanisms--including the von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov effect induced by the binary--often act together to produce abrupt and significant changes in planetary orbital evolution, with the outcome strongly dependent on the binary separation. The binary's eccentricity primarily dictates the number of surviving planets, while its inclination not only governs the final eccentricities of those survivors but also drives their orbits to align with the binary plane. Our simulations successfully reproduce the high eccentricities and compact orbits observed in four observed systems, showing close agreement between the modeled configurations and the actual systems."}

By visual inspections, we construct a sample of 152 CLAGNs from the literature, all of which show spectral transitions and large optical variability in their ZTF light curves. By analyzing 90 of these CLAGNs and the control samples of Type 1 AGNs, Type 2 AGNs, and extremely variable quasars (EVQs), matched in redshift ($0.2<z<0.8$) and supermassive black hole mass, we compare the color variability, structure function (SF), and variability metric $σ_{\\mathrm{QSO}}$, which quantifies how closely the light curves resemble a damped random walk (DRW) model. We find that while CLAGNs and EVQs differ from typical Type 1 and Type 2 AGNs in bolometric luminosity and Eddington ratio, the on/off-state CLAGNs share similar variability patterns with the overall CLAGN population, and distinct from EVQ, Type 1 and Type 2 AGNs.

As a physics-based SEP simulation and prediction model, SOFIE simulates the acceleration and transport of energetic particles in the coronal mass ejection (CME) driven shock in the solar corona and inner heliosphere. It has been validated against historical events. However, questions remain regarding whether a physics-based model, traditionally considered computationally expensive, could meet operational needs. The SWPT exercise offered a valuable opportunity to evaluate SOFIE's performance under simulated real-time conditions. Interactive feedback during the exercise from SWPC forecasters, SRAG console operators, CCMC personnel, and M2M SWAO analysts led to significant strategic improvements in the model setup to meet operational requirements. The resolution of the simulation domain was optimized by combining a coarser background grid with higher-resolution regions along the CME path and facing toward Earth, reducing computational cost without compromising accuracy. In this work, we present the operational performance of SOFIE and its capability to predict SEP fluxes significantly faster than real time. SOFIE was able to complete a 4-day SEP simulation within 5 hours on a supercomputer with 1,000 CPU cores during the SWPT exercise. This marks a critical milestone in demonstrating both the robustness and operational usefulness of SOFIE to support future human space exploration."}

Based on these intrinsic models, we generate mock MICADO images using SimCADO and mock HARMONI integral-field spectroscopic data cubes using HSIM. The HARMONI simulations utilize input stellar kinematics derived from Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM). We then process these mock observations: the simulated MICADO images are fitted with Multi-Gaussian Expansion to derive stellar mass models, and stellar kinematics are extracted from mock HARMONI cubes with pPXF. Finally, these derived stellar mass models and kinematics are used to constrain JAM dynamical models within a Bayesian framework. Our analysis demonstrates that SMBH masses can be recovered with an accuracy of $\\sim$10%. We find that MICADO can provide detailed stellar mass models with $\\sim$1 hour of on-source exposure.

While traditional and supervised machine learning methods have made remarkable progress in estimating atmospheric parameters and chemical compositions within existing physical models, these factors still constrain our ability to fully exploit the vast data sets provided by modern spectroscopic surveys. We aim to develop a self-supervised, disentangled representation learning framework that extracts chemically meaningful features directly from spectra, without relying on externally imposed label catalogs. We build a variational autoencoder-based representation learning model with physics-inspired structure: multiple decoders each focus on spectral regions dominated by a particular element, enforcing that each latent dimension maps to a single abundance. To evaluate the potential application of our framework, we trained and validated the model on low-resolution, low signal-to-noise synthetic spectra focusing on $\\rm [Fe/H]$, $\\rm [C/Fe]$, and $\\rm [α/Fe]$. We then demonstrate how the trained model can be used to flag stars as chemically enhanced or depleted in these abundances based on their position within the latent distribution.

Despite its widespread use, there has been no systematic study quantifying how much information can be obtained from just two on-sky positions and line-of-sight velocities, which are typically available for nearby external galaxies. In this work, we introduce axisymmetric, action-based dynamical models that use the positions and velocities of stellar halo stars to jointly constrain the total mass distribution of galaxies and the underlying DM component, as well as the stellar halo phase-space distribution. We rigorously test the method using both idealised equilibrium galaxy mocks and cosmological hydrodynamical simulations from the Auriga suite, systematically assessing how its performance degrades as the available phase-space information is progressively reduced. We further examine the impact of galaxy inclination, modelling assumptions, and methodological systematics on the recovered mass profiles. A crucial development in this work is the improved marginalisation of the model likelihood over missing phase-space dimensions. Our models successfully recover the total and DM mass distributions, as well as the kinematic properties of the stellar tracers, within the derived confidence intervals. However, we find that with limited (3D or 4D) phase-space information, the flattening of the DM halo cannot be constrained with any degree of certainty. Nevertheless, the recovered mass profile is insensitive to the flattening. This finding is independently validated by Schwarzschild modelling tests."}

We demonstrate that a new numerical scheme (termed `USM-BK' and implemented in the FLASH MHD code) reduces the dissipation of kinetic and magnetic energy, constrains the divergence of magnetic field to zero close to machine precision, and resolves smaller-scale structure than other, more conventional schemes, and hence, is the most accurate for simulations of low-Mach turbulent flows among the schemes compared in this work. We first compare several numerical schemes/solvers, including Split-Roe, Split-Bouchut, USM-Roe, USM-HLLC, USM-HLLD, and the new USM-BK, on a simple vortex problem. We then compare the schemes/solvers in simulations of the turbulent dynamo and show that the choice of scheme affects the growth rate, saturation level, and viscous and resistive dissipation scale of the dynamo. We also measure the numerical kinematic Reynolds number (Re) and magnetic Reynolds number (Rm) of our otherwise ideal MHD flows, and show that the new USM-BK scheme provides the highest Re and comparable Rm amongst all the schemes compared."}

Major space weather contributors are the solar wind and coronal mass ejections whose variable density, speed, temperature, and magnetic field make the automated classification of those structures challenging. In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations. Labels are derived from Parker Solar Probe measurements, forming a downstream classification task that maps plasma properties to solar wind structures. Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks. As a first proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions.

New JWST images of NGC 628 in particular, show clusters forming along the two spiral arms of this galaxy. In this paper we investigate filament and cluster properties in an NGC 628-like multi-scale high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulation. We use a filament finding tool to identify filaments and derive the probability density functions (PDFs) for the filament lengths and masses. Using a clustering algorithm we identify star clusters formed between 268 to 278 Myr and follow this population as the galaxy evolves for 60 Myr, calculating their mass PDFs, average radius growth rate, and average mass loss rate. We find a power-law index of alpha_m = -1.35 for the filament masses. Calculating the power-law index from our cluster mass PDF, we find a value of alpha_{c,m} = -1.35 when the clusters first form, exactly our filament mass power-law index. This shows that properties of young clusters arise from the gravitational fragmentation of their host filaments. We track the post-formation evolution of the clusters as they become unbound, increase in radius and decrease in mass yielding an ever steeper mass power-law index. After 60 Myr, the mass power-law index is alpha_{c,m} = -1.55, matching other simulations and observations."}

Using the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations, we quantify the mass and radial dependence of baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum by selectively replacing halos in the collisionless run with their full-physics counterparts. We find that group-scale halos with log $M_{200m}/h^{-1} M_{sun}$ in [13, 14] dominate the suppression, contributing a large fraction of the total reduction in power at k ~ 5-30 h/Mpc. The suppression is smaller on either side of this mass bin. Correctly reproducing the full suppression of the power spectrum requires accounting for matter redistribution (while enforcing mass conservation) beyond the virial radius of each halo. Crucially, the same group-scale regime produces the strongest and most detectable deviations in group-galaxy lensing, making stacked group lensing a powerful observational test of feedback models. Our results motivate emulators that jointly predict the matter power spectrum and halo-matter correlations including baryonic effects, enabling unbiased cosmological inference from small scales."}

This proof of concept study aims to improve SPI target prioritization by simulating SPI induced radio emission frequencies and estimating associated radio power to identify systems most likely to produce detectable signals. We combine Zeeman Doppler Imaging (ZDI) maps with 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stellar wind simulations and use the ExPRES code to model SPI driven radio emissions. We also estimate the intensity of these emissions using the Radio Magnetic Scaling Law, based on the magnetic field and plasma density parameters from the 3D wind models. This approach is applied to systems such as Tau Boo, HD 179949, and HD 189733 to assess their detectability with current and future radio telescopes. This framework, tested on benchmark systems, is applicable to any star planet system with available ZDI maps and wind models. As magnetic field reconstructions and wind simulations improve, the method will become more robust. It provides a data driven approach to prioritize targets and optimize telescope scheduling.

Moreover, the shape of the galaxies at $z=0$ correlates with their $f_{\\rm post-reio}^\\star$, with rejuvenators showing more spherical stellar distribution than relics. This difference arises only post-reionization when rejuvenators become rounder with more SF activity. Similarly, the shape of dark matter (DM) halos in the inner regions display more spherical distributions in rejuvenators than in relics. The shape evolution shows that DM haloes in all galaxy formation simulations become rounder in comparison to their collision-less, DM-only counterparts. However, DM haloes of rejuvenators evolve more significantly. We do not find any correlation between SF activity and formation of shallow DM density cores in these galaxies. These predictions can be tested using upcoming observational data.

We show that the curvature of the banks is negligible and that such a system can be found. We then show that a geometric placement algorithm via a uniform grid in the latent space combined with rejection of unphysical points using a normalizing flow results in templates that, while slightly less in number than the similar construction using random forests of Ref.~\\cite{Wadekar:2023kym}, perform slightly better in the effectualness tests, especially for high-mass binary systems.

While it is believed to play a key role in the feeding and feedback processes of supermassive black holes, its origins remain under debate. Existing studies have primarily focused on the morphology and kinematics of warm ionized gas. This work aims to provide a new perspective on warm (10,000 K) ionized gas and its connection to X-ray-emitting hot gas (>10^6 K) by measuring and comparing their metallicities. We conducted a joint analysis of 13 massive elliptical galaxies using MUSE/VLT and Chandra observations. Emission-line ratios were measured for the warm ionized gas using MUSE observation, and used to infer the ionization mechanisms and derive metallicities of the warm ionized gas using HII, and LIN(E)R calibrations. We also computed the warm phase metallicity using X-ray/EUV, and pAGB stars models. For two sources at higher redshift, direct Te method was also used to measure warm gas metallicities. Our observations reveal that most sources exhibit composite ionization, with contributions from both star formation and LINER-like emission. A positive linear correlation was found between the gas-phase metallicities of the warm and hot phases, ranging from 0.3 to 1.5 Zsun, and suggest the intimate connection between the two gas phases, likely driven by gas cooling and/or mixing. In some sources the warm gas metallicity shows a central drop. A similar radial trend has been reported for the hot gas metallicity in some galaxy clusters. The ionization mechanisms of cooling flow elliptical galaxies are diverse, suggesting multiple channels for powering the warm ionized gas. The large variation in the warm gas metallicity further suggests that cold gas mass derived under the assumption of solar metallicity for the CO-to-H2 conversion factor needs to be revised by approximately an order of magnitude."}

Non-oscillatory inflation is a class of models which can naturally introduce a post-inflationary stiff period of the Universe's evolution which boosts the signal of primordial gravitational waves (GWs), making it possible to observe them in forthcoming GW experiments. However, this pushes the GW energy density high enough to destabilise the process of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). This problem can be overcome by \"softening\" the stiff period, so that the field is gradually tending towards freefall from a frozen start.

As a low-metallicity starburst, IC10's interstellar medium conditions could reflect small-scale physical conditions that mirror those of early galaxies, providing a unique window into the heating and cooling processes that shaped the interstellar medium in early-Universe environments. Leveraging the high angular (<5'' ~ 15pc) and spectral (0.4 km/s) resolution of the Local Group L-band Survey, we searched for HI absorption against nine continuum radio sources and detected absorption along three sightlines corresponding to internal radio emission sources within IC10. Using Gaussian decomposition and radiative transfer, we characterize the CNM, deriving spin temperatures of ~30-55 K, column densities of (0.6-3.0)x 1$0^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, cold HI fractions of ~ 21-37%, and line widths of ~ 5.6-13.6 km/s. For each individual detection of HI absorption, we find corresponding molecular emission from 12CO (J=1-0), HCO+ (J=1-0), and HCN (J=1-0) at similar velocities and with comparable linewidths, indicating a well-mixed atomic and molecular medium. In IC10, the CNM shows a clear kinematic connection to the high-density ISM, implying a stronger dynamical coupling with molecular gas than in the Milky Way, in line with expectations for low-metallicity environments. At the ~ 15 pc scales probed by slightly extended HII regions in IC10, unresolved CNM clouds likely contribute to line blending, so the observed broad HI linewidths may partly reflect spatial and kinematic averaging."}

The background dynamics includes an attractor that funnels a wide range of initial conditions onto an evolution unique to each parameter space. In a large swath of parameter space beyond existing limits, the dark sector deviates drastically from cold dark matter in observable epochs. We rule out this parameter space using existing constraints on dark-sector equation of state and small-scale cosmic perturbations, thus setting the strongest constraints yet on dark matter self-interactions at length scales shorter than 100 kpc.

Although the inventory of sulfur molecules in disks has gradually increased over the last decade, CS is still the most commonly-observed sulfur-bearing species and it is expected to be the dominant gas-phase sulfur carrier beyond the water snowline. Despite this, few dedicated multi-line observations exist, and thus the typical disk CS chemistry is not well constrained. Moreover, it is unclear how that chemistry - and in turn, the bulk volatile sulfur reservoir - varies with stellar and disk properties. Here, we present the largest survey of CS to date, combining both new and archival observations from ALMA, SMA, and NOEMA of 12 planet-forming disks, covering a range of stellar spectral types and dust morphologies. Using these data, we derived disk-integrated CS gas excitation conditions in each source. Overall, CS chemistry appears similar across our sample with rotational temperatures of ${\\approx}$10-40 K and column densities between 10$^{12}$-10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. CS column densities do not show strong trends with most source properties, which broadly suggests that CS chemistry is not highly sensitive to disk structure or stellar characteristics. We do, however, identify a positive correlation between stellar X-ray luminosity and CS column density, which indicates that the dominant CS formation pathway is likely via ion-neutral reactions in the upper disk layers, where X-ray-enhanced S$^+$ and C$^+$ drive abundant CS production. Thus, using CS as a tracer of gas-phase sulfur abundance requires a nuanced approach that accounts for its emitting region and dependence on X-ray luminosity."}

In the presence of angular momentum, $Q$-balls acquire a toroidal structure with a central density void, qualitatively resembling the structure of disk galaxies. Motivated by this similarity, we investigate whether rotating scalar $Q$-balls can reproduce the observed galactic rotation curves. In this work, we use a recently developed hybrid numerical framework that combines a high-accuracy pseudo-spectral method with a physics-informed neural network approach to construct both static and rotating $Q$-ball solutions.

In this paper, we cover the overall methodologies employed and present our current results at $z=15$. Our main result so far is that black holes initially grow faster than their host galaxy, and hence over-massive black holes are a feature of the high-redshift Universe. The fundamental black hole-galaxy relationships we observe at $z = 0$ (especially the M$_{\\rm BH}$ - M$_*$ relationship) likely only emerge in more mature galaxies. At high-redshift, that relationship has not yet been established. We find that even at these high redshifts, MBHs can grow from their initial heavy seed mass of $\\sim$10$^4$ M$_\\odot$ up to 10$^6$ M$_\\odot$.

For the first time, we study ways to reduce the scatter using properties beyond X-ray luminosity, namely six ICM, six galaxy, and eleven dark matter halo properties. For both FLAMINGO and TNG300+TNG-Cluster, the gas fraction and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) signal correlate strongest with X-ray scatter, reducing it by over 50% when accounting for their partial correlations. Galaxy and halo properties correlate weakly with X-ray scatter, typically reducing it by 10-20%. Our results are qualitatively robust across different FLAMINGO feedback variations, though the correlations weaken for stronger feedback and with increasing redshift. Differences between FLAMINGO and TNG300+TNG-Cluster are only apparent at the high-mass end - where e.g. the galaxy stellar age correlates strongly for FLAMINGO, but not for TNG300+TNG-Cluster - confirming robustness across physics implementations.

While traditional and supervised machine learning methods have made remarkable progress in estimating atmospheric parameters and chemical compositions within existing physical models, these factors still constrain our ability to fully exploit the vast data sets provided by modern spectroscopic surveys. We aim to develop a self-supervised, disentangled representation learning framework that extracts chemically meaningful features directly from spectra, without relying on externally imposed label catalogs. We build a variational autoencoder-based representation learning model with physics-inspired structure: multiple decoders each focus on spectral regions dominated by a particular element, enforcing that each latent dimension maps to a single abundance. To evaluate the potential application of our framework, we trained and validated the model on low-resolution, low signal-to-noise synthetic spectra focusing on $\\rm [Fe/H]$, $\\rm [C/Fe]$, and $\\rm [α/Fe]$. We then demonstrate how the trained model can be used to flag stars as chemically enhanced or depleted in these abundances based on their position within the latent distribution. Our model successfully learns a representation of spectra whose axes correlate tightly with the target abundances ($r=0.92\\pm0.01$ for $\\rm [Fe/H]$, $r=0.92\\pm0.01$ for $\\rm [C/Fe]$, $r=0.82\\pm0.02$ for $\\rm [α/Fe]$). The disentangled representations provide a robust means to distinguish stars based on their chemical properties, offering an efficient and scalable solution for large spectroscopic surveys."}

As the temperature decreases and the field is released from its trapped configuration, inhomogeneities are exponentially amplified through an instability in their equation of motion, leading to the fragmentation of the axion field. We show that this process constitutes a novel source of gravitational waves (GWs), analogous to those generated in zero-temperature axion fragmentation, but with distinct characteristics. We quantify the resulting GW spectrum, identifying the peak frequency and amplitude associated with the inhomogeneous axion dynamics. Our results indicate that the GW signal can be enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the standard fragmentation scenario, while exhibiting a markedly different spectral shape. The parameter space featuring both strong GW signals and reproducing the correct dark matter abundance is, however, limited."}

The model in question predicts either a dominant phantom-type effective DE component with EoS $ω= -5/3$ or a hybrid scenario combining a cosmological constant ($ω= -1$) with a subdominant $ω= -5/3$ fluid (around $5\\%$) to address the Hubble tension (HT) and late-time acceleration. An analysis based on the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) demonstrates that the pure CKG fluid scenario $ω= -5/3$ is excluded, whereas the hybrid model remains only marginally compatible. Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis constrains the effective DE density parameter to $Ω_{\\text{eff}} = 0.009^{+0.006}_{-0.007}$ ($68\\%$ CL), consistent with zero and ruling out the around $5\\%$ contribution required by Harada's CKG. The resulting Hubble expansion history $H(z)$ and effective EoS $ω_{\\text{eff}}(z)$ are indistinguishable from those of $Λ$CDM. Bayesian model comparison via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) shows no statistical preference for CKG over $Λ$CDM ($Δ\\text{AIC} = +2.6$), disfavoring the additional complexity of the CKG model. The key output of this study is that both DE proposals in Harada's CKG are ruled out by current cosmological data, and HT remains unresolved."}

In agreement with previous findings, the totality of reference stars has negligible rotation (lower than 15 km/s). In contrast, we find high values of rotational velocity (up to $\\sim$ 150 km/s) for a sub-sample of BSSs.

The slow decay of the scalar field into RHNs can induce an early matter-dominated (EMD) era whose duration is sensitive to the RHN mass and gauge coupling $g^\\prime$. This non-standard cosmological phase reshapes the GW spectrum and leaves a distinctive RHN-mass-dependent spectral distortion that correlates with the flavour regime of thermal leptogenesis. Within this framework, one RHN can serve as a dark matter candidate produced nonthermally from scalar decays, while the remaining states generate the baryon asymmetry via thermal leptogenesis. For $g^\\prime=0.5$, we identify such a parameter region, and show that with singlet extensions, even with a smaller gauge coupling, one can realise this mechanism for the three-flavour regime. The resulting GW signals, amplified by supercooling and modified by EMD, provide a unique window to probe the scale and flavour structure of leptogenesis in future high-frequency GW observations."}

For this purpose, we estimate the distance from star to maser, the magnetospheric radius and magnetic field strength in the region of this radius. The distances from stars to masing regions lie in range from 380 to 620 au. Stellar and disk's magnetic field strengths are comparable at the magnetosphere boundary and lie in the range from 590 to 1880 G for considered objects.

Two major gamma-ray flares have been observed during the Fermi era: one in January 2011 and other in June 2019. During these events, CGRaBS J0211+1051 was also bright in other energy bands. On the other hand, there are also examples of optical activity that do not exhibit any comparable gamma-ray variability. Here, we study the temporal and spectral characteristics of the object in an attempt to understand the emission mechanisms operating in this source. A peculiar feature in its spectrum is the X-ray domain, which is unusually soft considering its object class. Interestingly, the relatively soft UV and optical spectrum does not extrapolate well to the X-rays. To mimic the observed SEDs during quiescent and flaring periods, we use both a purely leptonic and a hadro-leptonic modeling approach to reproduce four broadband SEDs from various epochs. When taking into account the steep optical-UV spectrum, we find that the hadro-leptonic scenarios better explains the SEDs compared to the purely leptonic model. The hadro-leptonic interpretation of the two gamma-ray flares suggests that CGRaBS J0211+1051 could be both a potential neutrino emitter and TeV-bright (E>10 TeV). Thus, it may offer a unique test bed to check for hadro-leptonic contributions to the multi-messenger emission in blazar jets."}

This process is enhanced in the soft limit, and is known to produce a significant frictional effect that is proportional to the Lorentz factor $γ$ of the bubble wall, thereby prohibiting runaway behavior. We calculate the analogous pressure for phase transitions with symmetry restoration. In such transitions, we show that the pressure due to this process can be $\\textit{negative}$, producing the opposite effect. However, when the Lorentz factor of the wall gets very large, the result approaches the same scaling as the standard scenarios. Therefore, phase transitions with symmetry restoration can feature an intermediate negative friction regime even in the presence of significant interactions with the plasma, and the bubble wall terminal Lorentz factor can be significantly larger (by more than an order of magnitude) than in the corresponding symmetry-breaking scenarios. This can carry important implications for various phenomenological applications, from gravitational waves to physics beyond-the-Standard-Model."}

Reconstructing Radial Velocity Curves of Classical Cepheids", "categories": ["astro-ph.SR", "astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "Submitted to A&A. Comments are welcome", "summary": "We present a novel framework for accurately reconstructing radial velocity (RV) curves of classical Cepheids (Cepheids) from sparsely sampled time-series data suitable for application in large spectroscopic surveys. The framework provides a set of priors for the principal components of RV curves established based on high-precision measurements from the VELOCE project; template RV curves of Cepheids can be readily extracted from our results. We demonstrate the ability of our framework to estimate unbiased pulsation average velocities, $v_γ$, to within $20-30$m/s, and peak-to-peak amplitudes, $P2P$, to within $\\sim 2\\%$. Subsampling the initial data set, we show that $v_γ$ and $P2P$ can be determined to within $\\sim 0.35$ km/s and $\\sim 6-7\\%$, respectively, from as few as three observations. We fitted existing time-series RV data of Cepheids in the LMC and SMC using this framework and obtained typical RMSE of $0.5-2.0$ km/s. The typical total uncertainty on $v_γ$ achieved for the SMC Cepheids is $\\sim 0.85$ km/s, providing sensitivity to spectroscopic binaries (SB). We identified 8 SB1 systems; two and one of which are new detections in the LMC and SMC, respectively. This yields a single-lined SB fraction of $\\sim 25\\%$ and $29\\%$ in the two galaxies, similar to the Milky Way's SB fraction of $29\\%$ established as part of VELOCE. Despite their relatively small number, LMC Cepheids reproduce the known line-of-sight component of the LMC's large-scale rotation, which differs in the extremes by more than $80$km/s. The kinematics of the SMC are more complex and not sufficiently sampled by the available Cepheids. Our framework is designed to yield accurate $v_γ$ and $P2P$ of Cepheids observed by large spectroscopic surveys, such as 4MOST, SDSS-V, and others, and will unlock new insights into the kinematics and multiplicity of evolved intermediate-mass stellar populations."}

Verne2 code available at https://github.com/bradkav/verne/", "summary": "While Dark Matter (DM) is typically assumed to interact only very weakly with the particles of the Standard Model, many direct detection experiments are currently exploring regions of parameter space where DM can have a large scattering cross section. In this scenario, DM may scatter in the atmosphere and Earth before reaching the detector, leading to a distortion of the DM flux and a daily modulation of the signal rate as the detector is shielded by more or less of the Earth at different times of day. This modulation is a distinctive signature of strongly-interacting DM and provides a powerful method of discriminating against time-independent backgrounds. However, the calculation of these Earth-scattering effects by Monte Carlo methods is computationally intensive, inhibiting a systematic exploration of the DM parameter space. Here, we present a semi-analytic formalism for calculating Earth-scattering effects, for models of MeV-mass DM which interacts via a dark photon mediator, and release the associated code Verne2. This formalism assumes that DM travels along straight-line trajectories until it scatters and is reflected back along its incoming path, along us to taking into account the affects of both attenuation and reflection in the Earth. We compare this formalism with the results of full Monte Carlo simulations for cross sections within reach of current and future DM-electron scattering searches. We find that Verne2 is accurate to better than 10-30%, making it suitable for performing signal modeling in the search for daily modulation, while reducing the computational cost by a factor of $\\sim10^4$ compared to full Monte Carlo simulations."}

This mechanism leads to a framework where the QCD axion and dark monopoles account for the dark matter density, and the observed baryon asymmetry is generated through the rotating QCD axion via axiogenesis. The monopoles acquire masses from a nonzero axion field, and they can transition between different quantized dyonic levels in the presence of a rotating axion field. The axion kinetic energy is dissipated by the transition, and thus the axion abundance is depleted to the observed dark matter abundance. We predict that the axion decay constant should be below $10^9$ GeV to explain the observed dark matter and baryon densities."}

Synference leverages the Synthesizer package for flexible forward-modelling of galaxy SEDs and integrates the LtU-ILI package to ensure best practices in model training and validation.

We validate this model, demonstrating excellent parameter recovery (e.g. R$^2>$0.99 for M$_\\star$) and accurate posterior calibration against nested sampling results. We apply our trained model to 3,088 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in the JADES GOODS-South field. The amortized inference is exceptionally fast, having nearly fixed cost per posterior evaluation and processing the entire sample in $\\sim$3 minutes on a single CPU (18 galaxies/CPU/sec), a $\\sim$1700$\\times$ speedup over traditional nested sampling or MCMC techniques.
