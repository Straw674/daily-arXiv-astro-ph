After removing the galaxy continuum and\nglobular clusters, we detected an excess of UV point sources near the center.\nBy comparing their colors to young stellar source (YSS) colors generated by\nstochastically simulated star formation (SF) for various SFRs and SFHs, we\nruled out their origin as a UV-upturn population and identified them as YSS. We\nfound an extremely low SFR of $\\sim 2\\times10^{-5}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in M87,\nwith evidence of a weak starburst $\\sim$125 Myr ago that formed $\\sim 1000$\nM$_\\odot$ of stars. Unlike other cool-core clusters where SF is stronger and\ndirectly linked to cooling gas, we found no spatial correlation between YSS and\nH$\\alpha$ filaments. Comparing SF activity with M87's AGN outburst history\nsuggests that recent AGN feedback events ($\\lesssim$12 Myr ago) neither\ntriggered nor were associated with any detectable SF, however, earlier\noutbursts may have triggered weak starbursts. We detected UV filaments\nco-spatial with H$\\alpha$ filaments with similar lengths and widths, though\nthey are obscured by dust near the center. These filaments are likely powered\nby metal-line emission from collisional ionization, suggesting ongoing\nlow-level precipitation of the intracluster medium. Our results indicate that\nAGN feedback has quenched SF significantly in M87 for at least 200 Myr, even\nthough some precipitation persists. Additionally, we identified a hotspot\ncreated by the counterjet, with the spectral index also constrained."}

It is unclear how these systems will evolve to the\ntight local relation between stellar mass and black hole mass. We search for\ncompanions around the z=7.08 quasar ULAS J1120+0641 using JWST/NIRCam narrow,\nmedium, and wide-band photometry to identify [O III] emitters at the quasar\nredshift, and explore the potential for growth of the host galaxy through\nfuture mergers. We find 22 sources near the quasar's redshift across our two\n4.4 arcmin$^2$ fields, indicating that environment of ULAS J1120+0641 is\nstrongly overdense in z~7.1 galaxies relative to the field. We estimate the\npotential future mass budget of the quasar host galaxy by summing the current\nstellar and gas masses of the quasar host and surrounding galaxies, correcting\nfor incompleteness and selection effects. With no further black hole growth,\nULAS J1120+0641 is unlikely to reach a $M_{\\mathrm{BH}}/M_*$ ratio less than\n~2.5% at z=0, still much higher than typical for local galaxies. However, such\nsystems -- a quiescent black hole in a low-luminosity galaxy -- may have\nescaped detection locally if they are sufficiently distant."}

In\nthis work, we conduct a comprehensive test of the CDDR by combining baryon\nacoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS and DESI surveys with type Ia\nsupernova (SN) data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We utilize an artificial\nneural network approach to match the SN and BAO data at the same redshift. To\nexplore potential violations of the CDDR, we consider three different\nparameterizations: (i) $\\eta(z)=1+\\eta_0z$; (ii) $\\eta(z)=1+\\eta_0z/(1+z)$;\n(iii) $\\eta(z)=1+\\eta_0\\ln(1+z)$. Our results indicate that the calibration of\nthe SN absolute magnitude $M_{\\rm B}$ plays a crucial role in testing potential\ndeviations from the CDDR, as there exists a significant negative correlation\nbetween $\\eta_0$ and $M_{\\rm B}$. For PantheonPlus analysis, when $M_{\\rm B}$\nis treated as a free parameter, no evidence of CDDR violation is found. In\ncontrast, fixing $M_{\\rm B}$ to the $M_{\\rm B}^{\\rm D20}$ prior with\n$-19.230\\pm0.040$ mag leads to a deviation at approximately the $2\\sigma$\nlevel, while fixing $M_{\\rm B}$ to the $M_{\\rm B}^{\\rm B23}$ prior with\n$-19.396\\pm0.016$ mag remains in agreement with the CDDR. Furthermore, overall\nanalyses based on the SDSS+DESY5 and DESI+DESY5 data consistently show no\nevidence of the deviation from the CDDR."}

While seismometers and geophones are commonly\nemployed to monitor ground motion for Newtonian noise cancellation, their\nlimited spatial coverage and high deployment costs hinder scalability. In this\nstudy, we demonstrate that distributed acoustic sensing offers a viable and\nscalable alternative, providing performance comparable to that of conventional\nseismic instruments. Using data from acoustic sensing and colocated\nseismometers during both natural and controlled events, we observe a strong\ncorrelation, exceeding 0.8, between the two sensor types in the 3 to 20 Hz\nfrequency band relevant for Newtonian noise. Moreover, when distributed\nacoustic sensing data are used to predict geophone signals, the correlation\nremains high, above 0.7, indicating that distributed acoustic sensing\naccurately captures both the spatial and spectral features of ground motion. As\na case study, we apply distributed acoustic sensing data to cancel noise\nrecorded by the vertical component of a seismometer and compare the results\nwith those obtained using geophone data for the same task. Both distributed\nacoustic sensing and geophone-based cancellations yield a residual noise factor\nof 0.11 at 20 Hz. These findings confirm the feasibility of using distributed\nacoustic sensing for Newtonian noise mitigation and highlight its potential, in\ncombination with traditional seismic sensors, to improve environmental\nmonitoring and noise suppression in current and next-generation gravitational\nwave observatories."}

To\ninterpret their results, it is critical to understand their intrinsic\nvariability, that is, how much the results change with numerical noise or\ninherent stochasticity of the physics model. We present a set of seven\nrealisations of high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a Milky\nWay-like galaxy with the Auriga galaxy formation model. All realisations share\nthe same initial conditions and code parameters, but draw different random\nnumbers for the inherently stochastic parts of the model. We show that global\ngalaxy properties at $z=0$, including stellar mass, star formation history,\nmasses of stellar bulge and stellar disc, the radius and height of the stellar\ndisk change by less than $10\\%$ between the different realisations, and that\nmagnetic field structures in the disc and the halo are very similar. In\ncontrast, the star formation rate today can vary by a factor of two and the\ninternal morphological structure of the stellar disc can change. The time and\norbit of satellite galaxies and their galaxy properties when falling into the\nmain halo are again very similar, but their orbits start to deviate after first\npericenter passage. Finally, we show that changing the mass resolution of all\nmatter components in the Auriga model changes galaxy properties significantly\nmore than the intrinsic variability of the model, and that these changes are\nsystematic.

Such black holes, if they existed in the Milky Way\nhalo, would give rise to long-duration microlensing events that may potentially\nlast for years. However, earlier searches were not sufficiently sensitive to\ndetect such events. Here, we present the results of searches for long-timescale\ngravitational microlensing events toward the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using\nnearly 20 years of photometric observations collected by the Optical\nGravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2001 to 2020. We found six events,\nthree of which are new discoveries. We use a sample of five events to measure\nthe microlensing optical depth toward the SMC $\\tau = (0.32 \\pm 0.18) \\times\n10^{-7}$ and the event rate $\\Gamma = (1.18 \\pm 0.57) \\times\n10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{star}^{-1}$. The properties of the detected\nevents are consistent with lenses originating from known stellar populations\nwithin the SMC or in the Milky Way disk. No events with timescales longer than\n1 yr were detected, which provides competitive limits on the fraction of\nmassive compact objects, including PBHs, in the Milky Way dark matter halo.\nTogether with the earlier OGLE studies of microlensing events in the direction\nof the Large Magellanic Cloud, these observations rule out PBHs and other\ncompact objects with masses ranging from $10^{-8}$ to $10^3\\,M_{\\odot}$ as\ndominant components of dark matter."}

After\nincluding stochasticity in terms of composite operator renormalization, we\napply the framework to the two-loop power spectrum of biased tracers and\nprovide a simple result suitable for numerical evaluation. In addition, we work\nout one- and two-loop renormalization group equations (RGE) for deterministic\nbias coefficients related to bias operators constructed from a smoothed density\nfield, generalizing previous works.

To assess\nwhether these clumps can evolve into GCs, we performed N-body simulations of\ntheir dynamical evolution from z=1.4 to z=0 (9.23 Gyr), under the effect of\ndynamical friction and tidal stripping. Dynamical friction is studied\nperforming multiple runs of a clump system in a Sparkler-like spherical halo of\nmass $M_{200}\\simeq 5\\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ (from the\nstellar-to-halo mass relation). For the tidal stripping, we simulated resolved\nclumps, orbiting in an external, static gravitational potential including the\nsame halo as in the dynamical friction simulations and also a Sparkler-like\nstellar disk. Dynamical friction causes the clumps with mass\n$>10^7\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ to sink into the galaxy central regions, possibly\ncontributing to the bulge growth. In absence of tidal stripping, the mass\ndistribution of the surviving clumps (40%) peaks at $5\\times\n10^6\\,\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$, implying the presence of uncommonly over-massive\nclumps at z=0. Tidal shocks by the stellar disk strip considerable mass from\nlow-mass clumps, even though their sizes remain larger than those of\npresent-day GCs.

Our simulations suggest that a fraction of the\nSparkler clumps is expected to fall into the central regions, where they might\nbecome bulge fossil fragments or contribute to form a nuclear star cluster.

In this study, we homogenize oxygen and iron\nmeasurements from star-forming galaxies at Cosmic Noon ($z{\\sim}2-3$) with\nresolved stellar abundances from the Local Group. The MW is divided into four\ncomponents, assuming the outer halo is dominated by debris from the\nGaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) progenitor.

Submitted to Phys. Rev. D", "summary": "We present the first independent re-analysis of the galaxy clustering data\nfrom DESI Data Release 1, utilizing an effective field theory (EFT)-based\nfull-shape model. We analyze the power spectra and bispectra of the public\ncatalogs using a custom-built pipeline based on window-deconvolved\nquasi-optimal estimators, carefully accounting for all relevant systematic\neffects. Compared to the official collaboration analysis, we add the galaxy\npower spectrum hexadecapole and the bispectrum monopole, and also introduce a\nnovel stochastic estimator for fiber collisions, which facilitates robust\nbispectrum analyses. As a first application, we perform an EFT-based full-shape\nanalysis of the DESI power spectra and bispectra in the context of the standard\ncosmological model, $\\Lambda$CDM. Using external priors on the physical baryon\ndensity and the primordial power spectrum tilt, we constrain the matter density\nfraction to $\\Omega_m=0.284\\pm 0.011$, the Hubble constant to $h=0.707\\pm\n0.011$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude to $\\sigma_8=0.811\\pm 0.030$. The\nbispectrum has a noticeable effect on parameter estimation: it sharpens the\nconstraints on $\\sigma_8$ and $\\Omega_m$ by $\\approx 10$\\% and shifts\n$\\Omega_m$ by $\\approx 1\\sigma$ towards the Planck $\\Lambda$CDM value.\nCombining our full-shape likelihood with the official DESI DR2 BAO\nmeasurements, cosmological parameters shift further towards the \\textit{Planck}\nvalues, with $\\Omega_m=0.296\\pm 0.007$, $h=0.688\\pm 0.006$, $\\sigma_8=0.818\\pm\n0.029$ (with tighter constraints obtained in joint analyses). Finally, the\ngalaxy bispectrum data dramatically improves measurements of quadratic bias\nparameters, which are consistent with predictions from halo occupation\ndistribution models. Our work highlights the importance of higher-order\nstatistics and sets the stage for upcoming full-shape analyses of non-minimal\ncosmological models."}
