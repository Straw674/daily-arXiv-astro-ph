Star clusters, stellar body and ionised gas properties", "categories": ["astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A. 12 pages, 10 figures, 2 appendices", "summary": "Context. Ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) are an intriguing population of\ngalaxies. Despite their dwarf-like stellar masses and low surface brightness,\nthey have large half-light radii and exhibit a diverse range of globular\ncluster (GC) populations. Some UDGs host many GCs while others have none,\nraising questions about the conditions under which star clusters (SC) form in\ndwarfs. GAMA526784, an isolated UDG with both an old stellar body and an\nextended star-forming (SF) front, including many young SCs, provides an\nexceptional case to explore the link between UDG evolution and star cluster\nformation. Aims. This study investigates the stellar populations, SCs, ionised\ngas, and kinematics of GAMA526784, focusing on its potential to form massive\nGCs and its connection to broader UDG formation scenarios. Methods. Imaging\nfrom HST and Subaru/HSC, alongside MUSE spectroscopy, were used to analyse the\ngalaxy's morphology, chemical composition, and kinematics. A combination of SED\nfitting and full spectral fitting was applied. Results. GAMA526784's central\nstellar body exhibits a low-metallicity ([M/H] ~ -1.0 dex) and an old age (~9.9\nGyr). The outskirts are much younger (~0.9 Gyr), but slightly more metal-poor\n([M/H] ~ -1.2 dex). The stellar kinematics show low velocity dispersions (~10\nkm/s) and a coherent rotational field, while the ionised gas exhibits higher\ndispersions (~50 km/s), a misaligned rotation axis (~20 deg) and localised SF,\nwhat could be suggestive of a recent interaction. The young SCs span ages of\n8-11 Myr and masses of log(M*/Mo)~5.0, while the old GCs have ~9 Gyr and\nstellar masses of log(M*/Mo)~5.5. Conclusions. GAMA526784's properties point to\ninteractions that triggered localised SF, leading to the formation of young\nSCs.

However, its\nformation history and evolutionary links to other structures in the Galactic\nCenter remain uncertain. This study aims to present the first comprehensive\nchemical census of the NSD by deriving abundance trends for 18 elements in 9 M\ngiants in the metallicity range of -1.0 <[Fe/H]< 0.5. By comparing these trends\nwith those of other Galactic populations we seek to understand the chemical\nrelationships between these structures. We obtained high-resolution H- and\nK-band spectra of NSD stars using the IGRINS spectrometer mounted on the Gemini\nSouth telescope. The giants were analyzed consistently with stars from a\ncomparison populations to minimize systematic uncertainties. The abundance\ntrends of NSD stars exhibit similarities with those of the inner-bulge and\nNuclear Star Cluster (NSC) populations across a broad range of elements with\ndifferent chemical evolution histories. The trends for 17 elements align\nclosely with the local thick-disc behaviour at subsolar metallicities. At\nsuper-solar metallicities, most elements follow the NSC and inner-bulge trends.\nSodium is the only element exhibiting a distinct trend, with enhanced\nabundances in the NSD and NSC compared to both thin-disc and inner-bulge stars.\nThe chemical similarity suggests that the NSD likely shares an evolutionary\nhistory with the NSC and possibly the inner-disc sequence.

The ages and metallicities of individual FFs reported here are the first\nsuch measurements in any galaxy and agree with the previously-reported\nmeasurement on stacked spectrum. The kinematical analysis reaffirms that the\nFFs belong to the disk of the galaxy, suggesting that their progenitors are\nmost likely massive, compact disk clusters that have been able to survive for\nlong timescales. We propose that the fuzzy appearance of FFs as compared to the\nGCs is a consequence of the dynamical evolution of their progenitor super star\nclusters in the disks of low-mass galaxies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4bNGC 1023\u4e2d\u7684\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u661f\u56e2\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u7cca\u661f\u56e2\u6bd4\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u66f4\u5e74\u8f7b\u4e14\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5176\u8d77\u6e90\u4e8e\u661f\u7cfb\u76d8\u4e2d\u7684\u8d85\u661f\u56e2\u3002", "background": "\u7814\u7a76\u80cc\u666f\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9NGC 1023\u4e2d\u7684\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u661f\u56e2\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u5176\u6027\u8d28\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u8d77\u6e90\u3002", "data": "\u4f7f\u752810.4\u7c73Gran Telescopio Canarias\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u5bf926\u4e2a\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u548c21\u4e2a\u6a21\u7cca\u661f\u56e2\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u5149\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u6d4b\u91cf\u9000\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6052\u661f\u5438\u6536\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5019\u9009\u4f53\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u3001\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u548c\u6d88\u5149\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b018\u4e2a\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u548c9\u4e2a\u6a21\u7cca\u661f\u56e2\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u6a21\u7cca\u661f\u56e2\u5e74\u9f84\uff087-9 Gyr\uff09\u660e\u663e\u5c0f\u4e8e\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\uff08>10 Gyr\uff09\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\uff08[Fe/H] = -0.58 \u00b1 0.33\uff09\uff0c\u6a21\u7cca\u661f\u56e2\u53ef\u80fd\u8d77\u6e90\u4e8e\u661f\u7cfb\u76d8\u4e2d\u7684\u8d85\u661f\u56e2\u3002"}}

Machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly unsupervised\nmethods, offer new ways to address these challenges by uncovering patterns in\ncomplex data. In this study, we apply Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to explore\nthe SED manifold of dwarf galaxies and evaluate AGN selection biases across\ndiagnostics. We train a 51 by 51 SOM on 30,344 dwarf galaxies (redshift less\nthan 0.055 and stellar mass below 10 to the 9.5 solar masses) from the NSA\ncatalog using nine-band photometry from near-UV to mid-infrared. A set of 438\npreviously identified dwarf AGNs, selected via various methods, was mapped onto\nthe SOM. AGNs identified by different methods occupy distinct and partially\noverlapping regions in SED space, reflecting selection biases tied to host\nproperties. BPT selected AGNs cluster in higher-mass regions, while X-ray and\nvariability-selected AGNs show broader distributions. WISE-selected AGNs are\nconcentrated in lower-mass regions and form two clumps: one associated with\nbluer, starburst-like systems and the other with redder, more AGN-like SEDs.\nThis separation may help distinguish true AGN hosts from starburst contaminants\nin WISE-selected samples.

Focusing on the transient epoch of bar formation,\na phase that triggers gas inflows, enhances local star formation, and drives\nsignificant orbital migration, we find that the star formation rate in the\ninner disk exhibits a pronounced peak during this period. This behavior arises\nfrom the combined effect of vigorous star formation driven by strong spiral\narms prior to bar formation and the subsequent suppression of star formation\nonce the bar is established. In contrast, star formation in the outer disk\npersists after bar formation at modest levels, and enhanced outward migration\nof stars originally formed in the inner regions gives rise to a pronounced peak\nin the outer disk's stellar age distribution corresponding to the bar formation\nepoch. Moreover, stars formed during this epoch tend to exhibit higher\ngas-phase metallicities, reflecting their origin in more metal-rich inner\nregions. Although our model does not capture every detail of the Milky Way's\ncomplex evolution, our results highlight the dominant role of bar driven\nmigration in segregating star formation activity and in shaping the long-term\nchemical and age structure of the Galactic disk.

Polarization reveals that the outflows have an X-shape\nstructure with a significant centro-symmetric pattern in polarization angle,\nindicating that the outflows are both hollow and scattering the emission from\nthe buried star. We constrain the half-opening angle of both the outflows and\ncircumstellar disk, determine the inclination of the system and estimate the\nobscured star's intrinsic flux. This study highlights the importance of\nhigh-resolution polarimetric observations in understanding the complex\nenvironment around Herbig Ae/Be stars and advocates for future similar\ninstruments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790LK-H\u03b1-233\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8fd1\u7d2b\u5916\u504f\u632f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86Herbig Ae/Be\u661f\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u53cc\u6781\u5916\u6d41\u548c\u5c18\u57c3\u76d8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u504f\u632f\u89c2\u6d4b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "background": "Herbig Ae/Be\u661f\u662f\u5e74\u8f7b\u7684\u3001\u4e3b\u5e8f\u524d\u6052\u661f\uff0c\u5176\u5468\u56f4\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u76d8\u548c\u53cc\u6781\u7535\u79bb\u5916\u6d41\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u884c\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u661f\u9645\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u91cf/\u7269\u8d28\u6c89\u79ef\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u504f\u632f\u6210\u50cf\u56e0\u5176\u5bf9\u53d1\u5c04\u3001\u6563\u5c04\u548c\u5438\u6536\u4ecb\u8d28\u5f62\u6001\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "data": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u54c8\u52c3\u592a\u7a7a\u671b\u8fdc\u955cFaint Object Camera\u57281991\u30011994\u548c1995\u5e74\u62cd\u6444\u7684LK-H\u03b1-233\u7684\u8fd1\u7d2b\u5916\u504f\u632f\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fd8\u539f\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff080.0287 x 0.0287\u89d2\u79d2\u00b2\uff09\u7684\u504f\u632f\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c4118\u57c3\u6ce2\u6bb5\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6697\u5e26\uff0c\u5c06\u63a5\u8fd1\u548c\u8fdc\u79bb\u7684\u53cc\u6781\u5916\u6d41\u5206\u5f00\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u906e\u853d\u4e3b\u5e8f\u524d\u6052\u661f\u5e76\u51c6\u76f4\u55b7\u51fa\u7269\u7684\u5c18\u57c3\u76d8\u6216\u73af\u3002\u504f\u632f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5916\u6d41\u5177\u6709X\u5f62\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u504f\u632f\u89d2\u5448\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5916\u6d41\u662f\u4e2d\u7a7a\u7684\u4e14\u6563\u5c04\u4e86\u88ab\u906e\u853d\u6052\u661f\u7684\u8f90\u5c04\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u7ea6\u675f\u4e86\u5916\u6d41\u548c\u5c18\u57c3\u76d8\u7684\u534a\u5f00\u89d2\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u503e\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u4f30\u7b97\u4e86\u88ab\u906e\u853d\u6052\u661f\u7684\u672c\u5f81\u6d41\u91cf\u3002"}}

Manuscript submitted to Journal on\n  25 April 2025", "summary": "Robust detections of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are essential\nto unravel the role of galaxy mergers in galaxy evolution and for identifying\npotential sources of low-frequency gravitational waves. One of the most\ncommonly used observational signatures of SMBHBs is periodic variability in the\nlight curves of active galactic nuclei (AGN), which may arise from accretion\nrate modulation or relativistic Doppler boosting due to binary orbital motion.\nHowever, intrinsic stochastic AGN variability can mimic such periodic signals,\ncomplicating robust identification. We report the discovery of 181 new SMBHB\ncandidates from a sample of approximately 770,000 AGN observed by the Gaia\nspace observatory. Periodic signals were identified using a novel and\ncomputationally efficient Bayesian model selection framework, enabling unbiased\nsource selection and quantifying the likelihood of periodicity over stochastic\nvariability. These candidates nearly double the known SMBHB population and\nprovide a prioritized target list for next-generation time-domain surveys.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7Gaia\u7a7a\u95f4\u5929\u6587\u53f0\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u7ea677\u4e07\u4e2a\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\uff08AGN\uff09\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65b0\u578b\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86181\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u6837\u672c\u3002", "background": "\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\uff08SMBHBs\uff09\u7684\u63a2\u6d4b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u661f\u7cfb\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u4f4e\u9891\u5f15\u529b\u6ce2\u6e90\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\uff08AGN\uff09\u7684\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u63a9\u76d6\u5468\u671f\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u63a2\u6d4b\u96be\u5ea6\u3002", "data": "\u7ea677\u4e07\u4e2a\u6d3b\u52a8\u661f\u7cfb\u6838\uff08AGN\uff09\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6765\u81eaGaia\u7a7a\u95f4\u5929\u6587\u53f0\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u5468\u671f\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86181\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8d85\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u9ed1\u6d1e\u53cc\u661f\u5019\u9009\u4f53\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u7ffb\u500d\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65f6\u57df\u5de1\u5929\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5148\u76ee\u6807\u5217\u8868\u3002"}}
