Building upon the foundations of quantum statistics in curved\nspacetime, we derive the conditions for BEC formation under extreme\ngravitational fields and explore their implications for compact objects and\nearly universe physics. Through rigorous mathematical treatment incorporating\ngeneral relativistic corrections to the Bose-Einstein distribution, we\ndemonstrate that BEC phenomena may play crucial roles in neutron star\ninteriors, primordial black hole formation, and dark matter halos. Our analysis\nreveals that the critical temperature for condensation exhibits non-trivial\ndependence on spacetime curvature, with corrections of order O(GM/rc2) becoming\nsignificant near compact objects. We further show that axion dark matter, if it\nexists, naturally forms a cosmic BEC with coherence length {\\lambda}dB ~ 10^-3\npc for ma ~ 10^-22 eV, potentially explaining the observed core-cusp problem in\ngalactic dark matter profiles. These findings suggest that quantum coherence\neffects at macroscopic scales may be more prevalent in the universe than\npreviously recognized, with profound implications for our understanding of\ncosmic structure formation and the behaviour of matter under extreme\nconditions."}

Establishing the quality of the 2D reconstruction of the filaments of the cosmic web with DisPerSE using Euclid photometric redshifts", "categories": ["astro-ph.CO", "astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "27 pages, 14 Figures", "summary": "Cosmic filaments are prominent structures of the matter distribution of the\nUniverse. Modern detection algorithms are an efficient way to identify\nfilaments in large-scale observational surveys of galaxies. Many of these\nmethods were originally designed to work with simulations and/or well-sampled\nspectroscopic surveys. When spectroscopic redshifts are not available, the\nfilaments of the cosmic web can be detected in projection using photometric\nredshifts in slices along the Line of Sight, which enable the exploration of\nlarger cosmic volumes. However, this comes at the expense of a lower redshift\nprecision. It is therefore crucial to assess the differences between filaments\nextracted from exact redshifts and from photometric redshifts for a specific\nsurvey. We apply this analysis to capture the uncertainties and biases of\nfilament extractions introduced by using the photometric sample of the Euclid\nWide Survey. The question that we address in this work is how can we compare\ntwo filament samples derived with redshifts of different precisions in the\nEuclid Wide Survey context. We apply the cosmic web detection algorithm\nDisPerSE, in the redshift range $0.1 \\leq z \\leq 0.5$, to the GAlaxy Evolution\nand Assembly (GAEA) simulated galaxy sample which reproduces several\ncharacteristics of the Euclid Wide Survey. We develop a method to compare\nskeletons derived from photometric redshifts to those derived from true galaxy\npositions. This method expands the commonly used measure of distance between\nfilaments to include geometrical (angles between filaments) and astrophysical\nconsiderations (galaxy mass gradients and connectivity-mass relations). We\nassess whether this approach strengthens our ability to correctly identify\nfilaments in very large surveys such as the Euclid Wide Survey. [abridged]"}

However, shower development is\ninfluenced by attenuation effects: measured signals at the ground depend on the\namount of traversed atmospheric density (column density) through which the\nshower evolves. Since the column density varies with the inclination of the\nshower, it is important to account for these attenuation effects to ensure\naccurate energy estimation.\n  In this study, we derive physics-and-geometry-based functional forms to\ndescribe attenuation and propose appropriate expansion terms using simple\none-dimensional shower-development models, incorporating one or two main\nparticle-cascade components.

To further test the robustness of our analysis, we carried\nout parallel simulations by creating inputs with different star formation\nhistory (SFH) complexity. The results from simulations show that codes such as\nALF and PyStaff, which both assume a simple stellar population (SSP) return\ngreater precision and accuracy only when the underlying population is a pure\nSSP; however, in cases where the SFH is more complex, these codes return\nerroneous results.

Bayesian model\ncomparisons against a common uncorrelated red noise for the gravitational wave\nbackground (GWB) disfavor a CW signal for almost all targets, yielding a mean\nBayes factor of $0.87 \\pm 0.31$. There are two notable exceptions: SDSS\nJ153636.22+044127.0, ``Rohan'' with $\\mathrm{BF} = 3.37(5)$, and SDSS\nJ072908.71+400836.6, ``Gondor'' with $\\mathrm{BF} = 2.44(3)$. These Bayes\nfactors correspond to p-values of $0.01$--$0.03$ ($1.9\\sigma$--$2.3\\sigma$) and\n$0.05$--$0.08$ ($1.4\\sigma$--$1.6\\sigma$), respectively, depending on the\nempirical null distribution. We outline the beginnings of a detection protocol\nby identifying and carrying out a battery of tests on Rohan and Gondor to\nverify their binary nature. Notably, when replacing the common uncorrelated red\nnoise model with a Hellings--Downs correlated GWB, Rohan's Bayes factor drops\nto $1.25(7)$, while Gondor's increases to $3.2(1)$. Both have rich\nelectromagnetic datasets, including optical and infrared variability and\nspectroscopic features that support their classification as SMBHB candidates,\nthough this was discovered after the targeted searches were complete. Our\nresults suggest more simulations are needed to confirm or refute the nature of\nthese and future SMBHB candidates, while creating a roadmap for targeted CW\ndetection."}

Establishing the quality of the 2D reconstruction of the filaments of the cosmic web with DisPerSE using Euclid photometric redshifts", "categories": ["astro-ph.CO", "astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "27 pages, 14 Figures", "summary": "Cosmic filaments are prominent structures of the matter distribution of the\nUniverse. Modern detection algorithms are an efficient way to identify\nfilaments in large-scale observational surveys of galaxies. Many of these\nmethods were originally designed to work with simulations and/or well-sampled\nspectroscopic surveys. When spectroscopic redshifts are not available, the\nfilaments of the cosmic web can be detected in projection using photometric\nredshifts in slices along the Line of Sight, which enable the exploration of\nlarger cosmic volumes. However, this comes at the expense of a lower redshift\nprecision. It is therefore crucial to assess the differences between filaments\nextracted from exact redshifts and from photometric redshifts for a specific\nsurvey. We apply this analysis to capture the uncertainties and biases of\nfilament extractions introduced by using the photometric sample of the Euclid\nWide Survey. The question that we address in this work is how can we compare\ntwo filament samples derived with redshifts of different precisions in the\nEuclid Wide Survey context. We apply the cosmic web detection algorithm\nDisPerSE, in the redshift range $0.1 \\leq z \\leq 0.5$, to the GAlaxy Evolution\nand Assembly (GAEA) simulated galaxy sample which reproduces several\ncharacteristics of the Euclid Wide Survey. We develop a method to compare\nskeletons derived from photometric redshifts to those derived from true galaxy\npositions. This method expands the commonly used measure of distance between\nfilaments to include geometrical (angles between filaments) and astrophysical\nconsiderations (galaxy mass gradients and connectivity-mass relations). We\nassess whether this approach strengthens our ability to correctly identify\nfilaments in very large surveys such as the Euclid Wide Survey. [abridged]"}
