We identify and catalogue 124 HII regions, down to\nH$\\alpha$ luminosities of $\\approx 5\\times$10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$, one order of\nmagnitude fainter than previous surveys on local galaxies, and compare these\nregions with the spatial distribution of ionising stars and embedded star\nclusters. For each region, we extract the corresponding integrated optical\nspectra and measured the intensity of key optical emission lines (H$\\beta$,\n[OIII], [NII], H$\\alpha$, [SII], [SIII], other weaker optical lines when\ndetectable, and Paschen lines) to characterize their physical properties of the\nioinized gas such as density, dust attenuation, and metallicity. Our spatially\nresolved line ratio and flux maps reveal remarkable diversity in ionisation\nproperties, from dust-obscured regions hosting young stellar objects to highly\nionised bubbles exhibiting high [OIII]/H$\\beta$ ratios (>5). Our data reveal a\ndiversity of ionisation fronts, ranging from well-defined to partial to absent.\nRadial profiles indicate the presence of both optically thin (density-bounded)\nand optically thick (radiation-bounded) HII regions.

In\nparticular, the ability to probe the ISM at $\\approx$ 5 pc resolution opens a\nnew window onto the complex structure of the ionised gas, enabling direct\ninsight into how stellar feedback operates on the scales where it originates."}

Recent studies have compared $\\sigma$ in observed and modeled\nstreams to probe DM properties, but have relied on stream models that neglect\nstrong encounters, black holes (BHs), and mass segregation in GCs. Such\nphenomena may inflate stream $\\sigma$ or introduce selection effects -- e.g., a\n$\\sigma$ that depends on star mass ($m$). We investigate this prospect using\nMonte Carlo $N$-body simulations of GCs under static Galactic tides to generate\nmock streams with realistic mass and velocity distributions.

Similar in magnitude to heating by\nGalactic substructure, this enhancement occurs because the GC's loss of BHs\nallows its most-massive stars to occupy its dense center, raising their\nlikelihood of strong ejection via binary interactions and adding broad,\nexponential wings to the stream's velocity distribution. Streams' kinematics\nthus probe properties (density, BH retention) of their progenitor GCs. Our\nresults also imply observations of streams from some GCs, especially those not\nsubject to highly episodic mass loss, may select for higher $\\sigma$ than\npredicted by models neglecting $\\sigma$'s $m$-dependence.

The interplay between these processes determines the star formation\nrate of the clouds. To study how feedback controls star formation, we use a\nnumerical framework that is optimized to simulate star cluster formation and\nevolution. This framework, called Torch, combines the magnetohydrodynamical\ncode FLASH with N-body and stellar evolution codes in the Astrophysical\nMultipurpose Software Environment (AMUSE). Torch includes stellar feedback from\nionizing and non-ionizing radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae, but, until\nnow, did not include protostellar jets. We present our implementation of\nprotostellar jet feedback within the Torch framework and describe its free\nparameters. We then demonstrate our new module by comparing cluster formation\nsimulations with and without jets. We find that the inclusion of protostellar\njets slows star formation, even in clouds of up to M $= 2 \\times 10^4$\nM$_{\\odot}$. We also find that the star formation rate of our lower mass clouds\n(M $= 5 \\times 10^3$ M$_{\\odot}$) is strongly affected by both the inclusion of\nprotostellar jets and the chosen jet parameters, including the jet lifetime and\ninjection velocity. We follow the energy budget for each simulation and find\nthat the inclusion of jets systematically increases the kinetic energy of the\ngas at early times. The implementation of protostellar jet feedback in Torch\nopens new areas of investigation regarding the role of feedback in star cluster\nformation and evolution."}

By construction, our model\nreproduces the same background expansion history as DESI's best-fit using the\nCPL parametrization, but assumes a vanishing rest-frame sound speed and no\nanisotropic stress. This simple prescription ensures a consistent and physical\ntreatment of perturbations, and the use of a unified dark sector avoids phantom\nbehaviour by construction. We model CMB, LSS, and redshift-space distortion\nobservables, and find differences with CPL that are typically at the\nfew-percent level. As a result, we forecast that even stage IV CMB and galaxy\nsurveys will have limited power to discriminate between our UDF and CPL at the\nlinear level. At the non-linear level, we study spherical collapse in the UDF\nand show that within this framework, structure formation proceeds very\nsimilarly to standard scenarios.\n  Using Planck, DESI BAO DR2, and DESY5 supernovae data, we demonstrate that\nthis simple UDF model fits current observations nearly as well as CPL, while\ntreating perturbations consistently. Because most cosmological observations are\nnot sensitive to how the dark sector is split, the unified framework can also\napproximate the phenomenology of interacting dark energy-dark matter scenarios\nor evolving dark matter, making it a general way to model the data, at least as\nlong as the dark components have a vanishing sound speed, which is the most\ndistinctive feature of our analysis.

M dwarfs have complex atmospheres, and their spectra\ncontain many wide and dense, overlapping molecular features, so determining\naccurate stellar parameters by fitting models has been difficult. To circumvent\nthis, other surveys have employed machine learning methods to transfer\nmeasurements of stellar parameters from high-resolution spectra to their\nmedium-resolution counterparts. These methods provide large catalogs of stellar\nparameters but, if not addressed properly, are plagued by biases which are, in\npart, due to the normalization of the spectra. Typical spectral normalization\nremoves the continuum but preserves the relative depths of the absorption\nfeatures, but optical M dwarf spectra are almost entirely made up of molecular\nabsorption, which makes this difficult. Here, we develop a standardization\nmethod that instead defines a pseudo-continuum. We use the spectrum's alpha\nshape to find the points which lie between the absorption features and apply\nlocal polynomial regression to find this pseudo-continuum. To tune the\nhyperparameters of this method, we create BOSS-like spectra from BT-NextGen\nmodels to replicate instrumental, signal-to-noise, and reddening effects. We\nfind that in both this generated set and a validation set of the SDSS-V data,\nour method performs better than alternative standardizations by producing\nspectra that are both more uniform for M dwarfs with similar stellar parameters\nand more easily distinguished compared to M dwarfs of differing parameters.\nThese results from our method will be crucial for better determining stellar\nparameters of M dwarfs using generative models."}

We validate the pipeline using simulated\nspectra processed to match Euclid's expected final data quality. Stacking\nenables robust recovery of key emission lines, including Halpha, Hbeta, [O\nIII], and [N II], below individual detection limits. However, the measurement\nof galaxy properties such as star formation rate, dust attenuation, and\ngas-phase metallicity are biased at stellar mass below log10(M*/Msol) ~ 9 due\nto the flux-limited nature of Euclid spectroscopic samples, which cannot be\novercome by stacking. The SFR-stellar mass relation of the parent sample is\nrecovered reliably only in the Deep survey for log10(M*/Msol) > 10, whereas the\nmetallicity-mass relation is recovered more accurately over a wider mass range.\nThese limitations are caused by the increased fraction of redshift measurement\nerrors at lower masses and fluxes. We examine the impact of residual redshift\ncontaminants that arises from misidentified emission lines and noise spikes, on\nstacked spectra. Even after stringent quality selections, low-level\ncontamination (< 6%) has minimal impact on line fluxes due to the\nsystematically weaker emission of contaminants. Percentile-based analysis of\nstacked spectra provides a sensitive diagnostic for detecting contamination via\ncoherent spurious features at characteristic wavelengths. While our simulations\ninclude most instrumental effects, real Euclid data will require further\nrefinement of contamination mitigation strategies."}

The transition\ntimes of these galaxy properties are tightly correlated with the time when the\nhost halo transits from fast to slow accretion, suggesting that the two-phase\nassembly of halos drive the two-phase formation of galaxies. The physical\norigin of dynamical hotness can be summarized into two modes of star formation:\na scattered mode in which stars form at large radii within cold gas streams\nassociated with fast assembly of halos, and a concentrated mode in which stars\nform at small radii through violent fragmentation from globally self-gravitated\ngas when halo assembly is about to slow down.

The CAPOS project aims to obtain accurate mean abundances and radial\nvelocities for many elements, and it explores the multiple population (MP)\nphenomenon in Galactic bulge globular clusters (BGCs). NGC 6569 is one of the\nCAPOS targets. Aims. This study provides a detailed high-resolution\nspectroscopic analysis of NGC 6569 to derive precise abundances for elements of\ndifferent nucleosynthetic origins and to unveil its MPs by focusing on key\nspectral features. Methods. We analyzed APOGEE-2 near-infrared spectra of 11\ngiant members with the BACCHUS code, deriving abundances for 12 elements (C, N,\nO, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Fe, Ni, Al, Ce, Nd). Isochrone fitting with Gaia+2MASS\nphotometry was used to estimate atmospheric parameters, cluster distance, and\nextinction. Results. We obtained [Fe/H] = -0.91 $\\pm$ 0.06, consistent with\nAPOGEE pipeline values; the scatter lies within uncertainties. The cluster\nshows [$\\alpha$/Fe] = 0.36 $\\pm$ 0.06 dex, similar to other GCs. Al appears\nhomogeneous, while N is strongly enriched ([N/Fe] = 0.68 $\\pm$ 0.34) with a\nspread of 0.90 dex, yielding two populations anticorrelated in C. The n-capture\nelements Ce and Nd are overabundant compared to the Sun but consistent with GCs\nof similar metallicity, with $\\langle$[Ce/Nd]$\\rangle$ = -0.17 $\\pm$ 0.12. We\nalso measure RV = -49.75 $\\pm$ 3.68 km s$^{-1}$, consistent with previous\nworks, while d$_\\odot$ = 12.4 $\\pm$ 1.45 kpc and E(B-V) = 0.68 are both higher\nthan literature values. Conclusions. MPs in NGC 6569 are confirmed through a\nclear C-N anticorrelation. The cluster shows [$\\alpha$/Fe] enhancement from\nType II SNe and no Mg-Al-Si anticorrelation, suggesting rapid and homogeneous\nformation. The $\\langle$[Ce/Nd]$\\rangle$ ratio points to contributions from\nr-process events such as neutron star mergers, while overall Ce and Nd\nabundances are reported here for the first time in this cluster."}

M dwarfs have complex atmospheres, and their spectra\ncontain many wide and dense, overlapping molecular features, so determining\naccurate stellar parameters by fitting models has been difficult. To circumvent\nthis, other surveys have employed machine learning methods to transfer\nmeasurements of stellar parameters from high-resolution spectra to their\nmedium-resolution counterparts. These methods provide large catalogs of stellar\nparameters but, if not addressed properly, are plagued by biases which are, in\npart, due to the normalization of the spectra. Typical spectral normalization\nremoves the continuum but preserves the relative depths of the absorption\nfeatures, but optical M dwarf spectra are almost entirely made up of molecular\nabsorption, which makes this difficult. Here, we develop a standardization\nmethod that instead defines a pseudo-continuum. We use the spectrum's alpha\nshape to find the points which lie between the absorption features and apply\nlocal polynomial regression to find this pseudo-continuum. To tune the\nhyperparameters of this method, we create BOSS-like spectra from BT-NextGen\nmodels to replicate instrumental, signal-to-noise, and reddening effects. We\nfind that in both this generated set and a validation set of the SDSS-V data,\nour method performs better than alternative standardizations by producing\nspectra that are both more uniform for M dwarfs with similar stellar parameters\nand more easily distinguished compared to M dwarfs of differing parameters.\nThese results from our method will be crucial for better determining stellar\nparameters of M dwarfs using generative models."}

Thus, in total, we report 2164 new lens candidates.\nOur method demonstrates the power of pairwise spectroscopic analysis and\nprovides a pathway complementary to imaging-based and single-spectrum lens\nsearches."}

PNe exhibit diverse morphologies, the origins\nof which are not fully understood. PNe with OH (OHPNe) and H$_{2}$O\n(H$_{2}$OPNe) masers are thought to be nascent PNe.

In order to identify more\nOHPNe and H$_{2}$OPNe, we used public databases and our own ATCA/VLA\nobservations to match the positions of OH and H$_{2}$O masers with known PNe\nand radio continuum emitters, considering radio continuum emission as a\npossible tracer of the photoionized gas that characterizes PNe. Here we report\nthe confirmation of positional coincidence of maser emission with one more PN,\nand 12 PN candidates. Moreover, we have confirmed three evolved stars as `water\nfountains' (WFs) hosting H$_2$O masers. These WFs are associated with radio\ncontinuum emission, but their possible nature as PNe has not yet been\nconfirmed. Although a final characterization of maser-emitting PNe as a group\nstill requires confirmation of more objects, their distribution in the infrared\ncolor-color diagrams suggests that they are a heterogeneous group of PNe. In\nparticular, the new OHPN IRAS 07027$-$7934 has been reported to contain a late\n[WC]-type central star, while the maser emission implies an O-rich envelope.\nThis property is found in only one other known maser-emitting PN, although we\nfound evidence that other confirmed and candidate OHPNe may also have mixed\nchemistry, since they show emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The\nnew WF IRAS 18443$-$0231 shows radio continuum that is dominated by strong and\nvariable non-thermal emission, as in magnetized outflows."}

The theory admits\na scalar-vector-tensor representation, obtained by introducing an auxiliary\nscalar field, and can therefore be reformulated as a scalar-vector-tensor\ntheory in a Riemann space, in the presence of a nonminimal coupling between the\nRicci scalar and the scalar field. By assuming that the Weyl vector has only a\nradial component, an exact spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the field\nequations can be obtained, which depends on three integration constants. As\ncompared to the Schwarzschild solution, the Weyl geometric gravity solution\ncontains two new terms, linear and quadratic in the radial coordinate,\nrespectively. In the present work we consider the possibility of testing and\nobtaining observational restrictions on the Weyl geometric gravity black hole\nat the scale of the Solar System, by considering six classical tests of general\nrelativity (gravitational redshift, the E\\\"{o}tv\\\"{o}s parameter and the\nuniversality of free fall, the Nortvedt effect, the planetary perihelion\nprecession, the deflection of light by a compact object, and the radar echo\ndelay effect, respectively) for the exact spherically symmetric black hole\nsolution of the Weyl geometric gravity. All these gravitational effects can be\nfully explained and are consistent with the vacuum solution of the Weyl\ngeometric gravity. Moreover, the study of the classical general relativistic\ntests also allows to constrain the free parameter of the solution."}
