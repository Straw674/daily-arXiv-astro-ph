Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "As wide-field optical surveys such as Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) begin operations, time-domain astronomy is facing a data revolution, paving the road for new, expanded variability studies. This work leverages the complementary power of optical variability and color selection to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN), focusing on optimizing the identification of obscured AGN, typically more challenging to distinguish from inactive galaxies based on optical variability alone. The analysis is designed to provide valuable insights in the context of performance preview for the LSST, albeit using a scaled-down version of the LSST dataset. We present the first combined AGN selection based on g+r+i band light curves from the VST-COSMOS survey, spanning 3.3 yr. We identify AGN candidates independently in each band using a random forest (RF) classifier trained on features mainly related to optical variability, along with six optical/infrared colors and a morphology indicator. We subsequently merge the three band-specific samples in order to enhance selection purity and reliability. We then focus on defining a subset of features that significantly improve the identification of obscured AGN. The RF classifiers yield a consistent performance across the three bands, highlighting the critical role of contamination. Using the combined three-band plus color selection we successfully recover $58^{+9}_{-8}\\%$ of all AGN and $69^{+10}_{-8}\\%$ of the known obscured AGN that have been independently confirmed in all three bands. When requiring confirmation in two out of the three bands, these fractions increase to $69^{+10}_{-8}\\%$ and $80^{+10}_{-9}\\%$, respectively. We also demonstrate that, while combining variability features with colors is crucial to improve obscured AGN selection, relying solely on color features returns a markedly higher contamination rate."}

For this study, we used a series of Monte Carlo simulations run with the MOCCA code to investigate the long-term dynamical evolution of binary stars in globular clusters hosting two distinct stellar populations. We explored how global binary properties such as incidence, fraction, and spatial distribution evolve over time due to the unique dynamical environment associated with each population. Our results show how binaries in the more centrally concentrated second population (P2) experience increased rates of hardening and disruption relative to the first population (P1), leading to distinct radial profiles in binary incidence and fraction. We also demonstrate the difference in spatial mixing timescales for binaries compared to single stars, where binary stars in each population retain some memory of their initial configurations even after complete single star mixing. Additionally, we investigated the formation and evolution of mixed binaries (binaries composed of a P1 component and a P2 component), which form primarily within the core through dynamical interactions. Finally, we studied main sequence--white dwarf binaries and find that they represent a larger fraction of binaries in P1 compared to P2. The results of this paper highlight the interplay between cluster dynamics and the evolution of binary stars and how binaries can act as tracers of the cluster's initial conditions and dynamical evolution."}

Here, we analyze archival integral field unit (IFU) data for the nearby Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1365, as observed with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Our analysis probes the ionization and kinematic properties of NGC 1365 at high spatial resolution over unprecedentedly large physical scales (approximately 40 kpc), allowing us to trace the effects of feedback throughout nearly an entire galaxy. We use these optical IFU data in conjunction with observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Chandra X-ray Observatory to analyze and compare maps of emission line flux, ionization state, star formation, and gas kinematics. In doing so, we identify a region of BPT-identified unexpectedly high ionization relative to surrounding areas in the star forming arms, and work to identify its source, finding that shock heating may play a significant role. Results from this analysis allow us to place constraints on the relative impact of AGN and star formation processes on the star forming gas in NGC 1365, as well as begin to inform our understanding on the global impacts of feedback in galaxy populations as a whole."}

The inclusion of spatially resolved kinematic data helps break the mass--sheet degeneracy, a key limitation in strong lensing. Kinematics, however, suffers from its own degeneracy due to unknown stellar velocity anisotropy, which can bias galaxy mass profile inferences. We investigate the bias in $H_0$ using a sample of ten massive elliptical galaxies at $z=0.2$ from the Illustris $TNG100$ simulations. We generate mock line-of-sight velocity-dispersion maps resembling JWST NIRSpec observations and test four anisotropy models: Osipkov--Merritt (OM), Mamon--Lokas (ML), constant $β$, and a generalized--OM (gOM) profile, under both kinematics-only and joint kinematics plus strong lensing analyses. We find a sub-percent average bias in $H_{0}$ across ten galaxies with joint modeling for three models: $+0.2 \\pm 1.6\\%$ (ML), $-0.9 \\pm 1.9\\%$ (constant) and $-0.9 \\pm 1.6\\%$ (gOM), with $\\sim 5\\%$ scatter. Joint modeling reduces bias, improves precision, and mitigates outlier results. Overall, the gOM model best recovers galaxy parameters and delivers the most accurate $H_{0}$ relative to posterior uncertainties considering both analyses. However, the single-parameter OM model produces large systematic biases: with kinematics only data, $H_{0}$ errors can exceed $20\\%$, and even with joint modeling, produces an overall bias of $+11.5 \\pm 1.3\\%$ (OM). The higher bias in OM is unlikely to average out across an ensemble of galaxies. Our findings highlight the impact of anisotropy assumptions on $H_{0}$ inference and, more broadly, in galaxy dynamics."}

Traditionally, the Ellis \\& Baldwin expression,$\\mathcal{A}=2+x(1+α)$, has been widely adopted, assuming power-law number counts and a single power-law spectral energy distribution (SED). Realistic surveys, however, involve a range of non-ideal effects, including diverse SEDs, finite instrumental bandpasses, non-power-law number counts, multi-band photometry and photo-$z$ selections, and direction-dependent or stochastic detection limits. In this paper, we incorporate these effects explicitly at the theoretical level and present a unified formulation of the kinematic dipole for a general parent population and a general multi-dimensional selection function. We show that the dipole amplitude is not described by a single index, but is instead given by a functional, $\\mathcal{A}[\\mathcal{W},f]$, defined as the Doppler response of the selection function acting on the underlying population. We demonstrate that the classical Ellis--Baldwin result is recovered as a special limiting case of this formalism, and clarify the relation between the theoretical coefficient $\\mathcal{A}$ and the dipole vector estimated from finite catalogs, separating theoretical response from statistical uncertainty.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Understanding dust attenuation in galaxies at both integrated and spatially resolved scales is fundamental for accurately determining the physical properties of galaxies. Recent high-spatial-resolution observations with ALMA and JWST enable investigations of spatially resolved properties in high-redshift galaxies ($z \\gtrsim 6$), but spatial variations in dust properties remain poorly constrained. We use cosmological zoom-in simulations combined with post-processing dust radiative transfer calculations for 376 clumpy galaxies at $z=6$-$9$ with stellar masses of $M_* \\gtrsim 10^9 \\, M_\\odot$. For each system, we investigate dust attenuation and re-emission properties for three components: system-integrated, individual clumps, and diffuse regions. We find that system-integrated attenuation curves are grayer than the Calzetti curve, even when assuming MW- or SMC-type dust. Attenuation curves of individual clumps are even grayer, while diffuse regions exhibit steeper curves owing to enhanced scattering in optically thin environments. Since the effects of optical depth and dust-star geometry are intrinsically degenerate in attenuation curves, we introduce a toy model based on the IRX-$Δβ$ plane, where $Δβ$ denotes the difference between attenuated and intrinsic UV slopes. Applying this framework, we find that clumps have dust column densities approximately an order of magnitude higher than system-integrated values and exhibit co-spatial or dust-extended geometries. In contrast, system-integrated attenuation reflects star-extended geometries driven by contributions from optically thin diffuse regions. We apply this framework to REBELS-IFU galaxies at $z \\sim 7$ and find good agreement with our simulation predictions."}

It is a manifestation of the innate human curiosity about the Cosmos, and it has inspired numerous works of art and folklore, including whole literary and other media genres.

There is also an obvious connection with religious beliefs, as gods and other superhuman beings were imagined in the heavens. Speculations about alien beings grew in time, and today, it is a scientific subject of astrobiology, and it is pursued through serious searches for life and intelligence in the universe. However, almost all imaginings of the alien map terrestrial life forms and human cultural, historical, and psychological phenomena to the putative aliens. This lack of individual and collective imagination may reflect our biological and cultural evolution, as our minds are formed through our experiences, perceptions of the world, and interactions with our terrestrial and human environments. As such, imagining aliens is mainly a cultural phenomenon and may reflect the intrinsic cognitive limitations of the human mind. Interestingly, we did create what is effectively an alien intelligence on this planet in the form of now rapidly evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI).

Crucially, tensor modes propagate at the speed of light in this framework. However, their amplitude undergoes a modified damping during their evolution. We adopt a model-independent parameterization and derive an analytic approximation to the tensor mode transfer function to obtain the spectral energy density of primordial inflationary gravitational waves. Comparison with the NANOGrav 15-year and IPTA second data releases show that the inferred damping parameter $n$ remains consistent with GR, yet allows small deviations that could be observable. We then conduct a Fisher information matrix forecasts which demonstrate that the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) observatory will improve these constraints by several orders of magnitude, offering the potential to distinguish $f(Q)$ gravity from GR with high precision.

To obtain a complete picture of AGN outflows and their feedback effects, we present a study of both ionized and warm molecular gas outflows in six type-2 AGNs ($z<0.1$) that exhibit strong ionized outflows in previous optical observations. Utilizing the Triple Spectrograph and Double Spectrograph instruments on the Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope, we conduct spatially resolved measurements in the slit direction of strong emission lines from both ionized and warm molecular gas, such as $\\rm [O\\ III]$, $\\rm Paα$, $\\rm H_{2}$ 1-0 S(1), etc., allowing for a direct comparison of their outflow properties.

These structures emerged during the transition from the Dark Ages to the Cosmic Dawn, a period that remains observationally unconstrained despite strong theoretical progress. During this epoch, neutral hydrogen absorbed a fraction of cosmic microwave background photons through its 21-cm hyperfine transition, producing a 21-cm absorption signal whose evolution encodes the early Universe's thermal and ionization history. However, extracting the underlying astrophysical parameters from this signal is limited by severe parameter degeneracies, which cannot be resolved without independent observational probes. The next-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as Cosmic Explorer (CE), will observe binary black hole (BBH) mergers up to very large redshifts and hence will detect a fraction of them formed within the redshift range $\\sim 13-25$. The merger rate of these BBHs will depend on the star formation rate density (SFRD) at these redshifts, together with the BBH formation efficiency and a time delay distribution. Therefore, the merger rate of these BBHs can work as a tracer of the SFRD in the redshift range $\\sim 13-25$.

In this work, we evaluated a series of open-weight and commercial VLMs on six tasks relevant to radio astronomy, such as source morphology classification. We also introduced radio-llava, a fine-tuned multimodal assistant built on the LLaVA architecture and adapted for the radio domain through instruction fine-tuning.\n  In zero-shot mode, commercial models like GPT-4.1 outperform open-weight VLMs on most radio benchmarks. However, radio-llava significantly improves upon both base LLaVA and commercial models across nearly all tasks. Despite these gains, specialized vision-only models still deliver substantially better performance across the board. Additionally, we observed that fine-tuning introduces catastrophic forgetting on general multimodal tasks, with performance drops up to 40% that can be partly mitigated with a more diverse training dataset or shallow fine-tuning."}

However, classical studies of baryon fractions in massive galaxy clusters have long suggested that gravitationally bound systems may retain cosmological information through their baryonic content. Building on this insight, we present the first analytic and physically interpretable cosmological tracer that links the matter density parameter, $Ω_m$, directly to intrinsic galaxy-scale observables, demonstrating that cosmological information can be extracted from individual galaxies. Using symbolic regression applied to state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations from the CAMELS project, we identify a compact functional form that robustly recovers $Ω_m$ across multiple simulation suites (IllustrisTNG, ASTRID, SIMBA, and Swift-EAGLE), requiring only modest recalibration of a small number of coefficients. The resulting expression admits a transparent physical interpretation in terms of baryonic retention and enrichment efficiency regulated by gravitational potential depth, providing a clear explanation for why $Ω_m$ is locally encoded in galaxy properties. Our work establishes a direct, interpretable bridge between small-scale galaxy physics and large-scale cosmology, opening a complementary pathway to cosmological inference that bypasses traditional clustering-based statistics and enables new synergies between galaxy formation theory and precision cosmology."}

Indeed, despite dedicated advancements in telescope and observing techniques over decades, achieving ultra-deep photometric depths in optical wavelengths remains a formidable challenge.

Methods for processing the obtained data were developed. To assess the stability of the module parameters, an internal control technique was used, involving data from other detectors. The results of testing and long-term continuous monitoring showed that the stability of the developed muon detector is better than 0.1%/year, without the need for its operation in a thermostatic chamber.

In this work we investigate the self-resonance in deformed $α$-attractor T-model with a Gaussian feature near the minimum, distant from inflation's end. Linear analysis reveals altered resonance bands and deformed Floquet charts dependent on feature parameters. In fully nonlinear lattice simulations, we find that the gradient energy transfer is largely independent of the potential feature parameter $h$. In contrast, after resonance terminates, the subsequent evolution of gradient energy becomes strongly dependent on $h$. Statistical analysis reveals that models with the potential feature produce larger number of smaller oscillons, with a reduced energy stored in these objects, increasingly suppressed as the magnitude of $h$ grows. By tracking the total energy and the gradient energy contained in oscillons, we find that in models with nonzero $h$ oscillons are systematically shorter-lived, with this effect strengthening for larger $h$. The gravitational wave emission is dominated by the resonance stage and is strongly suppressed once oscillons form. Potential features leave the low-frequency spectrum largely unchanged but significantly modify the high-frequency tail. Although a complete reheating description requires external couplings and higher-resolution simulations, clear qualitative differences of cosmic expansion history already emerge within our simulated time window. These results highlight the important role of potential features in shaping reheating dynamics and their cosmological implications, and provide a deeper understanding of preheating dynamics and the properties of oscillons."}

We find a notable discrepancy between the optical and X-ray views: while optical data reveal a pronounced bimodal galaxy distribution with significant kinematic substructure signatures, the X-ray emission exhibits a single, smoothly extended component centered on the BCG. Our weak lensing analysis resolves this discrepancy by revealing that the mass is predominantly concentrated in the southeast ($\\log M_{200}/M_\\odot = 14.04_{-0.40}^{+0.24}$), while the northwestern substructure has a negligible mass ($\\sim 10^{13} M_\\odot$).

However, because such observables depend on cumulative line-of-sight integrals over the Hubble rate, their sensitivity to time-dependent features of the dark energy equation of state is intrinsically limited. In this work, we examine this limitation from an information-based perspective using the eigenvalue structure of the Fisher information matrix constructed from distance, expansion rate, and growth observables. We show that distance and expansion-rate data generically produce a strongly hierarchical Fisher spectrum dominated by a single information mode, reflecting an irreducible loss of sensitivity to temporal variations in dark energy. This behavior can be traced directly to the integrated kernel structure of geometric observables. Growth measurements, by contrast, respond through differential dynamics and can introduce additional independent information directions. Using both controlled mock data and survey-like configurations representative of next-generation experiments, we find that the impact of growth information depends not only on its nominal precision but also on the structure of the data covariance. In simplified mock setups, growth measurements can partially activate a second information direction even at moderate precision. In Euclid-like configurations, however, the information remains effectively one-dimensional until growth precision reaches the percent level, below which a second mode emerges rapidly. These results clarify the complementary roles of distance and growth probes and provide a model-independent criterion for assessing the physical content of cosmological constraints on dynamical dark energy."}

We examine specifically an approximation to the \"linearly exact\" gradients (aLE) with standard SPH kernel gradients and with linearly reproducing kernels (RPKs) that fulfill the lowest order consistency relations exactly by construction. Most of the explored SPH formulations use shock dissipation (i.e. artificial viscosity and conductivity) with slope-limited reconstruction and parameters that trigger on both shocks and noise. We also compare with a recent particle hydrodynamics formulation that uses both RPKs and Roe's approximate Riemann solver instead of shock dissipation. Not too surprisingly, we find that the shock tests are rather insensitive to the gradient accuracy, but whenever instabilities are involved the gradient accuracy plays a crucial role. The reproducing kernel gradients perform best, but they are closely followed by the much simpler aLE gradients. The Riemann solver approach has some (minor) advantages in the shock tests, but shows some resistance against instability growth and at low resolution the corresponding Kelvin-Helmholtz simulations show substantially slower instability growth than the best shock dissipation approaches. Based on the battery of benchmark tests performed here, we consider a shock dissipation approach with reproducing kernels (our versions $V_3$ and $V_5$) as best, but closely followed by a similar version ($V_2$) that uses the simpler and computationally cheaper aLE gradients."}

Assuming GR at the background level, we map the reconstructed kinematics onto a dark-energy fluid and a scalar-field description, yielding the total potential and kinetic contributions that reproduce the inferred $H(z)$. To interpret the reconstruction, we consider both a minimal single-field model (canonical or phantom) and a two-field (quintom) system consisting of one canonical and one phantom scalar field (or families). Within the GR-based effective-fluid mapping, the inferred dark-energy density changes sign for all dataset combinations explored, transitioning from $ρ_{\\rm DE}<0$ at higher redshift to $ρ_{\\rm DE}>0$ toward the present, and defining a transition redshift $z_\\dagger$ by $ρ_{\\rm DE}(z_\\dagger)=0$.

The pipeline combines radial mode discovery, batched L-BFGS refinement, and Laplace-based analytic integration, treating modes independently and converting large batches of likelihood evaluations into massively parallel GPU workloads.\n  For Gaussian and near-Gaussian posteriors, where the Laplace approximation is exact or highly accurate, SunBURST achieves numerical agreement at double-precision tolerance in dimensions up to 1024 in our benchmarks, with sub-linear wall-clock scaling across the tested range. In multimodal Gaussian mixtures, conservative configurations yield sub-percent accuracy while maintaining favorable scaling.\n  SunBURST is not intended as a universal replacement for sampling-based inference. Its design targets regimes common in physical parameter estimation and inverse problems, where posterior mass is locally well approximated by Gaussian structure around a finite number of modes. In strongly non-Gaussian settings, the method can serve as a fast geometry-aware evidence estimator or as a preprocessing stage for hybrid workflows. These results show that high-precision Bayesian evidence evaluation can be made computationally tractable in very high dimensions through deterministic integration combined with massive parallelism."}

The inclusion of spatially resolved kinematic data helps break the mass--sheet degeneracy, a key limitation in strong lensing. Kinematics, however, suffers from its own degeneracy due to unknown stellar velocity anisotropy, which can bias galaxy mass profile inferences. We investigate the bias in $H_0$ using a sample of ten massive elliptical galaxies at $z=0.2$ from the Illustris $TNG100$ simulations. We generate mock line-of-sight velocity-dispersion maps resembling JWST NIRSpec observations and test four anisotropy models: Osipkov--Merritt (OM), Mamon--Lokas (ML), constant $β$, and a generalized--OM (gOM) profile, under both kinematics-only and joint kinematics plus strong lensing analyses. We find a sub-percent average bias in $H_{0}$ across ten galaxies with joint modeling for three models: $+0.2 \\pm 1.6\\%$ (ML), $-0.9 \\pm 1.9\\%$ (constant) and $-0.9 \\pm 1.6\\%$ (gOM), with $\\sim 5\\%$ scatter. Joint modeling reduces bias, improves precision, and mitigates outlier results. Overall, the gOM model best recovers galaxy parameters and delivers the most accurate $H_{0}$ relative to posterior uncertainties considering both analyses. However, the single-parameter OM model produces large systematic biases: with kinematics only data, $H_{0}$ errors can exceed $20\\%$, and even with joint modeling, produces an overall bias of $+11.5 \\pm 1.3\\%$ (OM). The higher bias in OM is unlikely to average out across an ensemble of galaxies.

We investigate whether MHD simulations of thermally bi-stable neutral interstellar medium, with a range of CNM fraction, can reproduce the properties of the 3C196 field, the high Galactic latitude test field. Using 50 pc simulations with varying levels of turbulence and compressibility, we generated synthetic 21 cm and synchrotron observations, including instrumental noise and beam effects, for different line-of-sight orientations relative to the magnetic field. We developed MOOSE, a code to generate synthetic synchrotron polarization and Faraday tomography. We also developed a metric based on the HOG algorithm, to quantify the relative contribution of cold and warm neutral medium structures to the Faraday tomographic data. The synthetic observations show levels of polarization intensity and RM values comparable to the 3C196 field, indicating that thermal electrons associated with the neutral HI phase can account for a significant fraction of the synchrotron polarized emission at 100-200 MHz. The simulations consistently reveal a correlation between CNM and Faraday tomographic structures that depends on turbulence level, magnetic field orientation, and observational noise, but only weakly on CNM fraction. We found slightly weaker CNM-Synchrotron polarized emission correlation level than observed in the 3C196 field. These results suggest that low-frequency polarimetric observations provide a valuable probe of magnetic-field morphology in the multi-phase Solar-neighborhood ISM, while simultaneously underscoring the need for improved modeling of the turbulent, multi-phase, and partially ionized interstellar medium."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "As wide-field optical surveys such as Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) begin operations, time-domain astronomy is facing a data revolution, paving the road for new, expanded variability studies. This work leverages the complementary power of optical variability and color selection to identify active galactic nuclei (AGN), focusing on optimizing the identification of obscured AGN, typically more challenging to distinguish from inactive galaxies based on optical variability alone. The analysis is designed to provide valuable insights in the context of performance preview for the LSST, albeit using a scaled-down version of the LSST dataset. We present the first combined AGN selection based on g+r+i band light curves from the VST-COSMOS survey, spanning 3.3 yr. We identify AGN candidates independently in each band using a random forest (RF) classifier trained on features mainly related to optical variability, along with six optical/infrared colors and a morphology indicator. We subsequently merge the three band-specific samples in order to enhance selection purity and reliability. We then focus on defining a subset of features that significantly improve the identification of obscured AGN. The RF classifiers yield a consistent performance across the three bands, highlighting the critical role of contamination. Using the combined three-band plus color selection we successfully recover $58^{+9}_{-8}\\%$ of all AGN and $69^{+10}_{-8}\\%$ of the known obscured AGN that have been independently confirmed in all three bands. When requiring confirmation in two out of the three bands, these fractions increase to $69^{+10}_{-8}\\%$ and $80^{+10}_{-9}\\%$, respectively. We also demonstrate that, while combining variability features with colors is crucial to improve obscured AGN selection, relying solely on color features returns a markedly higher contamination rate."}

When this breaking occurs dynamically in the early Universe, stable domain wall networks are formed, which can eventually dominate the cosmic energy density. To avoid this problem, explicit $\\mathcal{Z}_2$-breaking terms in the scalar potential are usually introduced in an ad hoc manner. In this Letter, we show that if the same $\\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry is also responsible for generating light Dirac neutrino masses, such explicit breaking terms can instead arise radiatively from the particles involved in the Dirac mass generation. We find that the resulting bias term scales inversely with the cube of the Dirac neutrino mass, leading to a gravitational wave spectrum proportional to the sixth power of the Dirac neutrino mass. This establishes a nontrivial connection between the Dirac seesaw scale, the domain wall annihilation epoch, and the resulting stochastic gravitational wave signal. We further demonstrate that a wide range of Dirac seesaw scales can be probed by upcoming gravitational wave and cosmic microwave background experiments, while part of the parameter space simultaneously explains the observed baryon asymmetry via Dirac leptogenesis."}

VPIE can be used to extract information about the planetary flux contribution without the need for the planet to transit, or use of a stellar spectral model. VPIE utilizes a linear combination of a small set of individual spectra to produce an empirical model of the stellar contribution at each time step, thereby normalizing each spectrum and leaving only an imprint of the planet's flux in the residual data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VPIE through simulated James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of three known exoplanet orbiting late-type M stars: the warm giant TOI-519 b, the warm sub-Neptune GJ 876 d, and the temperate super-Earth Proxima Centauri b. Our results indicate that though VPIE loses sensitivity for very high redistribution values, it can successfully distinguish between various atmospheric circulation regimes (zero, moderate, or high heat redistribution) and constrain planetary radii for non-unity day-night temperature ratios. While performance for cooler targets may be limited by JWST spectroscopic capabilities at longer wavelengths, future VPIE improvements or new instrumentation could enable characterization of potentially habitable planets. VPIE offers a promising new framework for pulling back the veil on the population of non-transiting planets around nearby M-stars that are otherwise inaccessible to current techniques."}

Cold fronts-sharp discontinuities formed during cluster mergers-offer a potential avenue to probe the effective viscosity of the ICM.

We perform cluster merger simulations incorporating four ICM viscosity models: (A) inviscid, (B) isotropic Spitzer viscosity, (C) anisotropic Braginskii viscosity, and (D) Braginskii viscosity limited by microinstabilities. The isotropic Spitzer viscosity (case B) strongly suppresses KHI, producing smooth cold front surfaces, while the inviscid (A) and microinstability-limited (D) cases show prominent ripples. The Braginskii case (C) yields intermediate suppression. We also vary the plasma $β$ parameter ($β\\approx$ 100 and 1600) to examine how a changing magnetic field strength affects the results. Stronger magnetic fields further suppress KHI, leading to smoother fronts and reduced differences between different viscosity models, while also widening the range of permitted pressure anisotropies when microinstability-based limiters are present.

They appear in different sizes, having a wide distribution in their area. We analyse the sunspot group area of the past 13 cycles and the Bipolar Magnetic Region (BMR) flux for Cycles 23 and 24 to explore their area and flux distributions and connect with the theory. We find that, in general, the group area and BMR flux are statistically larger in the rising phase than in the declining phase of the solar cycle. This implies that the rising phase of the solar cycle is prone to drive more intense space weather. We further show that the mean and median of the area distribution during the rising phase are dependent on cycle strength. However, the distribution mean and median are cycle strength-independent or weakly dependent during the decline phases of the solar cycles, particularly during the last three years when the latitudinal bands of all cycles migrate towards the equator along the same trajectory. These results support the theoretical model of nonlinear flux loss due to flux emergence, which explains why solar cycles rise differently but decay similarly."}

We find a notable discrepancy between the optical and X-ray views: while optical data reveal a pronounced bimodal galaxy distribution with significant kinematic substructure signatures, the X-ray emission exhibits a single, smoothly extended component centered on the BCG. Our weak lensing analysis resolves this discrepancy by revealing that the mass is predominantly concentrated in the southeast ($\\log M_{200}/M_\\odot = 14.04_{-0.40}^{+0.24}$), while the northwestern substructure has a negligible mass ($\\sim 10^{13} M_\\odot$). This immense mass disparity rules out the dynamical possibility of a rotating system. We demonstrate that the apparent optical bimodality arises from the projection of a filament, which led optical group-finding algorithms to misclassify these galaxies as cluster members.

However, classical studies of baryon fractions in massive galaxy clusters have long suggested that gravitationally bound systems may retain cosmological information through their baryonic content. Building on this insight, we present the first analytic and physically interpretable cosmological tracer that links the matter density parameter, $Ω_m$, directly to intrinsic galaxy-scale observables, demonstrating that cosmological information can be extracted from individual galaxies. Using symbolic regression applied to state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations from the CAMELS project, we identify a compact functional form that robustly recovers $Ω_m$ across multiple simulation suites (IllustrisTNG, ASTRID, SIMBA, and Swift-EAGLE), requiring only modest recalibration of a small number of coefficients. The resulting expression admits a transparent physical interpretation in terms of baryonic retention and enrichment efficiency regulated by gravitational potential depth, providing a clear explanation for why $Ω_m$ is locally encoded in galaxy properties. Our work establishes a direct, interpretable bridge between small-scale galaxy physics and large-scale cosmology, opening a complementary pathway to cosmological inference that bypasses traditional clustering-based statistics and enables new synergies between galaxy formation theory and precision cosmology."}

A confident host association would provide stellar population properties to constrain BBH formation channels and enable measurements of cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant, H0. We simulate BBH mergers in nearby (z<0.25) host galaxies to evaluate the feasibility of host identification with future GW detector networks, including configurations with the planned LIGO-India detector and third-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). We construct two injection grids to explore variations in BBH mass, distance, and directional sensitivity, and infer localization volumes using the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-based parameter estimation implemented through BILBY. To assess the prospects for unique host identification, we introduce a set of diagnostics: theoretical comoving volume thresholds for galaxies of a given stellar mass, derived from galaxy stellar mass functions, a metallicity-based volume threshold motivated by progenitor environment models, stellar mass fractions to quantify candidate host prominence, and the probability of chance alignment (p_c). These metrics provide ways to evaluate host associations and constrain BBH formation channels. We find that future networks that include ET and CE localize BBH mergers to volumes smaller than those theoretical thresholds, implying potentially unique host identification, out to ~1000 Mpc at a rate of ~100 yr^{-1}. While associations for individual events may remain uncertain, our framework is well-suited to population-level analyses, enabling constraints on BBH formation scenarios in the era of next-generation GW detector networks."}

Cold fronts-sharp discontinuities formed during cluster mergers-offer a potential avenue to probe the effective viscosity of the ICM. Velocity shear across these fronts should generate Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI), unless viscosity or magnetic tension suppresses them. We perform cluster merger simulations incorporating four ICM viscosity models: (A) inviscid, (B) isotropic Spitzer viscosity, (C) anisotropic Braginskii viscosity, and (D) Braginskii viscosity limited by microinstabilities. The isotropic Spitzer viscosity (case B) strongly suppresses KHI, producing smooth cold front surfaces, while the inviscid (A) and microinstability-limited (D) cases show prominent ripples. The Braginskii case (C) yields intermediate suppression. We also vary the plasma $β$ parameter ($β\\approx$ 100 and 1600) to examine how a changing magnetic field strength affects the results. Stronger magnetic fields further suppress KHI, leading to smoother fronts and reduced differences between different viscosity models, while also widening the range of permitted pressure anisotropies when microinstability-based limiters are present. These results indicate that both viscosity and magnetic fields play crucial roles in stabilising sloshing cold fronts in galaxy clusters."}

Leveraging this structure, we introduce a physics-conditioned diffusion model that operates in a compact latent space to generate high-fidelity black hole imagery directly from physical parameters. The model accurately reproduces critical observational signatures from full GRRT simulations-such as shadow diameter, photon-ring structure, and relativistic brightness asymmetry-while achieving over a fourfold reduction in computational expense. Compared with the previous generation of denoising diffusion models, the proposed approach achieves significant improvements in image quality, reconstruction fidelity, and parameter estimation accuracy, while reducing the average inference time per black hole image from 5.25 seconds to 1.15 seconds.

We show that different proposals have different implications which may be distinguished. We then test the hypothesis that the UV corrections to the black hole geometry may be responsible for the current phase of accelerated expansion.

Starting from a prestellar core without turbulence and with a misalignment between the initial magnetic field and rotation axis, the simulations are performed for $\\sim10^5$ yr after protostar formation. After disk formation, the magnetic field around the disk becomes significantly distorted due to the disk rotational motion. Consequently, the structure of the pseudodisk also evolves into a complex morphology. As a result, both accretion onto the disk and outflow become asymmetric and anisotropic. Accretion to the disk occurs primarily through narrow-channel flows or streams. The time evolution of the infalling envelope leads to non-steady accretion onto the disk, which in turn causes variability in the mass accretion onto the central protostar. This study demonstrates that complex infalling envelope structures and channelized accretion flows onto the disk naturally arise even without assuming turbulence or external asymmetric inflows."}

Recovering the dynamic 3D gas near a black hole would reveal previously-unseen parts of the universe and inform new physics models. However, only sparse radio measurements from a single viewpoint are possible, making the dynamic 3D reconstruction problem significantly ill-posed. Previously, BH-NeRF addressed the ill-posed problem by assuming Keplerian dynamics of the gas, but this assumption breaks down near the black hole, where the strong gravitational pull of the black hole and increased electromagnetic activity complicate fluid dynamics. To overcome the restrictive assumptions of BH-NeRF, we propose PI-DEF, a physics-informed approach that uses differentiable neural rendering to fit a 4D (time + 3D) emissivity field given EHT measurements. Our approach jointly reconstructs the 3D velocity field with the 4D emissivity field and enforces the velocity as a soft constraint on the dynamics of the emissivity. In experiments on simulated data, we find significantly improved reconstruction accuracy over both BH-NeRF and a physics-agnostic approach. We demonstrate how our method may be used to estimate other physics parameters of the black hole, such as its spin."}

While the Small Magellanic Cloud has been thoroughly investigated with over 120 systems identified, the Large Magellanic Cloud has lacked a complete survey due to its large angular size. Most prior studies targeted central or high-star-formation regions. The SRG/eROSITA all-sky surveys now enable a comprehensive coverage of the LMC, particularly due to its close vicinity to the south ecliptic pole. This work aims to improve our understanding of the HMXB population in the LMC by building a flux-limited catalogue. This allows us to compare sample properties with those of HMXB populations in other nearby galaxies. Using detections during the first eROSITA all-sky survey, we cross-matched X-ray positions with optical and infrared catalogues to identify candidate HMXBs. We assigned flags based on multi-wavelength follow-up observations and archival data, using properties of known LMC HMXBs. These flags defined confidence classes for our candidates. We detect sources down to X-ray luminosities of a few $10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$, resulting in a catalogue of 53 objects, including 28 confirmed HMXBs and 21 new eROSITA detections. We identify several likely supergiant systems, including a candidate supergiant fast X-ray transient with phase-dependent flares. We find three Be stars with likely white dwarf companions. Two of the Be/WD candidates show steady luminosities across four eROSITA scans, unlike the post-nova states seen in the majority of previous Be/WD reports. Our catalogue is the first to cover the entire LMC since the ROSAT era, providing a basis for statistical population studies.

It is currently under review at Space Science Reviews", "summary": "The renewed interest in lunar exploration and the development of future lunar communication and navigation services highlight the need for a precise, stable, and interoperable geodetic and timing infrastructure on the Moon. NovaMoon, proposed as a scientific and navigation payload for ESA's Argonaut lander, is designed as a lunar-based local differential, geodetic, and timing station supporting both operational needs in the Moon's south polar region and a broad range of scientific investigations. The payload integrates a lunar laser retroreflector, a Very Long Baseline Interferometry transmitter, a receiver for navigation signals compatible with LunaNet standards, high-stability atomic clocks, and direct-to-Earth radio links -- making it the first lunar station to co-locate multiple ranging, tracking, and timing techniques. NovaMoon will enable sub-metre to decimetre positioning, provide local differential corrections for lunar users, and ensure an accurate and stable realisation of position and time. Preliminary simulation studies show that this multi-technique dataset improves the lunar reference frame, orientation and ephemerides, and estimates of interior parameters like tidal response and core properties. NovaMoon will also provide the first long-duration physical realisation of a lunar time reference. Beyond its primary goals, it supports improved cartography, precise surface geolocation, and higher-resolution topography, contributing to safer landings and operations. It also enables new tests of fundamental physics, including constraints on relativity and possible deviations from classical gravity."}

A confident host association would provide stellar population properties to constrain BBH formation channels and enable measurements of cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant, H0. We simulate BBH mergers in nearby (z<0.25) host galaxies to evaluate the feasibility of host identification with future GW detector networks, including configurations with the planned LIGO-India detector and third-generation detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). We construct two injection grids to explore variations in BBH mass, distance, and directional sensitivity, and infer localization volumes using the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-based parameter estimation implemented through BILBY. To assess the prospects for unique host identification, we introduce a set of diagnostics: theoretical comoving volume thresholds for galaxies of a given stellar mass, derived from galaxy stellar mass functions, a metallicity-based volume threshold motivated by progenitor environment models, stellar mass fractions to quantify candidate host prominence, and the probability of chance alignment (p_c). These metrics provide ways to evaluate host associations and constrain BBH formation channels. We find that future networks that include ET and CE localize BBH mergers to volumes smaller than those theoretical thresholds, implying potentially unique host identification, out to ~1000 Mpc at a rate of ~100 yr^{-1}. While associations for individual events may remain uncertain, our framework is well-suited to population-level analyses, enabling constraints on BBH formation scenarios in the era of next-generation GW detector networks."}

This investigation is motivated by the fact that Mercury's post-Newtonian gravitational field (as well as that of any other planet) admits an expansion in terms of multipole moments, which are most appropriately defined in the local reference system. The equations of motion in the Mercury-centric local frame include relativistic local perturbations, given by the Schwarzschild term, Lense-Thirring precession, and the acceleration due to the quadrupole moment, and relativistic third-body perturbations, which are the gravito-electric and gravito-magnetic accelerations, along with a coupling term between Mercury and other solar system bodies. The relativistic third-body perturbations are usually neglected in all practical applications. In this study, we analyze the magnitude of the post-Newtonian terms of the equations of motion formulated in the Mercury-centric frame, evaluating them along the trajectories of the two BepiColombo spacecrafts. Based on this analysis, we provide a practical approach for constructing a high-accuracy relativistic orbital model suitable for a Mercury orbiter."}

Our objective is to apply a mapping technique to estimate the age of a system and the initial chemical composition. We also evaluate the influence of observational uncertainties in mass and heavy-element mixtures on results. We applied an inverse calibration method to the evolution of a multiple stellar system, assuming that the stars share the same age and initial chemical composition. This approach determines age, the initial mass fractions of helium ($Y_{ini}$) and heavy elements ($Z_{ini}$), as well as the convective mixing-length parameters ($α_A $ and $α_B$). It uses the observed luminosities ($L_A$ and $L_B$), radii ($R_A$ and $R_B$), and surface chemical compositions ($Z/X_A$ and $Z/X_B$). We used the most recent observational data for $M$, $R$, $L$, and $[Fe/H]$ of $α$ Centauri A and B as input data for our method. We compared two assumptions for the $Z/X$ ratio, following the results for the solar composition. For an assumed high solar $Z/X_\\odot =0.0245$, we obtain an age of $7.8 \\pm 0.6$ Ga, $Y_{ini} = 0.284 \\pm 0.004$, and $Z_{ini} = 0.0335 \\pm 0.0015$. For a low solar $Z/X_\\odot = 0.0181$, the derived age is $8.7 \\pm 0.6$ Ga, $Y_{ini} = 0.267 \\pm 0.008$, and $Z_{ini} = 0.025 \\pm 0.002$. Observational errors in the stellar masses of $\\pm$0.002 lead to an age error of 0.6 Ga. Overshooting of $0.05-0.20H_p$ at the boundary of the convective core increases the age by $0.6-2.1$ Ga. Models with higher $Z/X$ and radiative cores, with ages of $7.2-7.8$ Ga, appear preferable and show better agreement with the observed asteroseismic frequencies."}

In this work, we report the discovery of a compact binary system consisting of two WDs in the centre of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 6397. The system, known in the literature as NF1, was observed as part of a MUSE radial-velocity survey aiming at characterizing the binary population in the centre of NGC 6397. The spectral analysis of NF1 provides an effective temperature of 16000 K and a surface gravity (log g) of 5.72 (cgs), which is consistent with an extremely low-mass He-core WD nature. This is further supported by the mass of 0.23 +/- 0.03 Msun obtained from fitting the star's spectral energy distribution using its HST magnitude in various filters. The system has a circular orbit with a period of 0.54 days. The radial velocities show a large semi-amplitude of 200 km/s, implying a minimum mass of 0.78 Msun for the invisible companion, which is likely another WD, or a neutron star if the inclination of the system is smaller than about 50 deg. Some significant residuals in radial velocity remain with our best orbital solution and we tested whether a model with a third body can explain these deviations. While this possibility seems promising, additional measurements are needed to confirm whether the star is actually part of a triple system."}

Submitted to A&A. Comments welcome", "summary": "PN K4-47 is a young planetary nebula that exhibits shock-excited bipolar lobes and a complex molecular environment, with the highest number of molecules detected within a planetary nebula. It has been questioned whether K4-47 is indeed a `typical' planetary nebula, or may be more exotic in nature. We examine this question using optical imaging and spectroscopy, and sub-millimetre and radio interferometry. Our observations spatially resolve the sub-millimetre environment of K4-47 for the first time. We find elongated CO (2-1) emission along a similar PA to the optical bipolar outflow. We derive a distance upper limit of 6 kpc to the source. The source hosts a fast ($\\sim$350 km s$^{-1}$) bipolar optical outflow, and a slow (~50-60 km s$^{-1}$) molecular outflow along a similar PA. The outflow velocity indicates an age of 336 $\\pm$ 119 yr. We also find that the excitation temperature and density of the atomic gas is~20 kK and 2800 cm$^{-3}$, respectively. The elemental and isotopic enrichment of K4-47 infers an AGB progenitor mass of 4-6 M$_{\\odot}$, which corresponds to a white dwarf mass of ~1 M$_{\\odot}$, following the initial-final mass relation for white dwarfs. We find that the core of K4-47 must contain 10$^{-2}$ M$_{\\odot}$ of dust to explain the extinction, and that photoionisation alone cannot explain the excitation of the atomic gas. We instead require an additional heating mechanism, with shocks a likely scenario. It is likely that the progenitor star of K4-47 was a J-type carbon AGB star, which formed the molecular and dusty circumstellar environment. The bipolar outflow is later triggered, punching through the circumstellar environment, producing shocks, and shaping the environment into the elongated structure seen in the sub-millimetre. We therefore classify K4-47 as a genuine, if unusual, planetary nebula."}
