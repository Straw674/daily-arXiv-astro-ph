VI. The Formation of Low-mass Multiple Systems in High-mass Cluster-forming Regions", "categories": ["astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "This paper has been accepted by ApJ", "summary": "Most stars form in multiple systems, with profound implications in numerous astronomical phenomena intrinsically linked to multiplicity. However, our knowledge about the process on how multiple stellar systems form is incomplete and biased toward nearby molecular clouds forming only low-mass stars, which are unrepresentative of the stellar population in the Galaxy. Most stars form within dense cores in clusters alongside high-mass stars (>8 M$_{\\odot}$), as likely the Sun did. Here we report deep ALMA 1.33 mm dust continuum observations at ~160 au spatial resolution, revealing 72 low-mass multiple systems embedded in 23 high-mass cluster-forming regions, as part of the Digging into the Interior of Hot Cores with ALMA (DIHCA) survey. We find that the companion separation distribution presents a distinct peak at ~1200 au, in contrast to the one at ~4000 au observed in nearby low-mass regions. The shorter fragmentation scale can be explained by considering the higher pressure exerted by the surrounding medium, which is higher than the one in low-mass regions, due to the larger turbulence and densities involved. Because the peak of the companion separation distribution occurs at much larger scales than the expected disk sizes, we argue that the observed fragmentation is produced by turbulent core fragmentation. Contrary as predicted, the multiplicity fraction remains constant as the stellar density increases. We propose that in the extremely dense environments where high-mass stars form, dynamical interactions play an important role in disrupting weakly bound systems."}

As a precursor, the miniJPAS survey observed a 1 deg$^2$ field with the same filter system, providing an ideal testbed for the study of spatially resolved galaxies. In this work, we investigate the resolved stellar population and emission-line properties of 51 miniJPAS galaxies, classified by spectral type (red or blue) and environment (group or field), and assess the role of environment in galaxy evolution. We use the Py2DJPAS pipeline to process the data, homogenise the images to a common PSF, define galactic regions, and extract photo-spectra. Radial profiles are analysed using elliptical annuli spaced by 0.7 R_EFF, combined with an inside-out segmentation to study star formation histories. Stellar population parameters are derived with the Bayesian SED-fitting code BaySeAGal, while artificial neural networks are used to estimate the equivalent widths of the H$α$, H$β$, [NII], and [OIII] emission lines. We find clear trends in a mass density-colour diagram: denser, redder regions are older, more metal-rich, and have lower specific star formation rates, while bluer, less dense regions show stronger emission lines and higher sSFRs. Red and blue galaxies are well separated in these relations, whereas environmental classification shows no clear distinction. Radial profiles support an inside-out formation scenario, with significant differences between red and blue galaxies but no strong environmental dependence. We suggest that the weak environmental effects may be due to the relatively low stellar masses of the galaxy groups in our sample."}

Rubin Observatory", "categories": ["astro-ph.GA", "astro-ph.HE"], "comment": "11 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ApJ", "summary": "Reverberation mapping is one of the main techniques used to study active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks. Traditional continuum reverberation mapping uses short lags between variability in different wavelength AGN light curves on the light crossing timescale of the disk to measure the radial structure of the disk. The harder-to-detect long negative lag measures lags on the longer inflow timescale, opening up a new window to mapping out the vertical structure of AGN disks. The Vera Rubin Observatory, with its 6 wavebands, long baseline, and high cadence, will revolutionize our ability to detect short and long lags. However, many challenges remain to detect these long lags, such as seasonal gaps in Rubin light curves, the weak signal strength of the long lag relative to the short lag, and the enormous influx of data for millions of AGN from Rubin. Machine learning techniques have the potential to solve many of these issues, but have yet to be applied to the long negative lag problem. We develop and train a transformer-based machine learning model to detect long and short lags in mock Rubin AGN light curves. Our model identifies whether a light curve in our test set has a long negative lag with 96% recall and 0.04% contamination, and is 98% accurate at predicting the true long lag. This accuracy is an enormous improvement over two baseline methods we test on the same mock light curves, the interpolated cross correlation function and javelin, which are only 54% and 21% accurate, respectively."}

The combined gravitational effects of these components, along with relativistic corrections from the BH's spin, generate strongly nonlinear dynamics and frequent chaotic orbital behaviour. To model this environment, we employ a multipolar expansion potential in which the central compact object is represented by the Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov pseudo-Newtonian potential, effectively capturing spin-dependent features of a Kerr-like BH. The surrounding halo is treated as an axisymmetric, shell-like mass distribution expanded up to third order in multipolar terms to account for realistic asymmetry. Previous studies have mainly explored the influence of multipolar moments and BH spin using Poincare sections, SALI, and related chaos indicators. In this work, we extend these analyses by incorporating stability analysis and basins of convergence to achieve a more complete understanding of the system's dynamics. Stability analysis around equilibrium points provides insight into local behavior, while basins of convergence highlight sensitivity to initial conditions and expose fractal basin boundaries. Our results show that the BH spin significantly reshapes phase space: depending on its magnitude and orientation, it can either amplify chaotic scattering caused by halo asymmetry or stabilize specific orbital families. These findings enhance our understanding of how relativistic spin effects and multipolar mass distributions jointly govern the dynamical architecture of galactic centers."}

At the same time, these observations challenge the validity of such classical methods when applied to the extreme environments typical at high redshift. We present an in-depth analysis of the ISM in three representative case studies at $z=2 - 6$ (MARTA 4327, the Sunburst Arc and RXCJ2248-ID) conducted within a multi-cloud photoionisation modelling framework (HOMERUN). We show that even a small fraction of unresolved high-density clumps can contribute more than half of the observed flux of auroral lines, while only negligibly to standard optical density tracers. As a result, $T_{\\mathrm{e}}$-method metallicities can be underestimated by $\\sim 0.15 - 0.3$ dex, as for MARTA 4327. By modelling rest-frame UV and optical data, we demonstrate that discrepancies between abundances obtained from diagnostics tracing different zones do not necessarily imply chemical inhomogeneities. In RXCJ2248-ID, the disagreement between UV and optical N/O may naturally arise from ionisation and density structure alone. In contrast, we find evidence for genuine chemical stratification in the Sunburst Arc, where a component enriched in nitrogen coexists with a chemically normal one. Finally, we argue that very-high-ionisation lines may be explained within a pure star-formation scenario invoking matter-bounded regions. However, in the case of RXCJ2248-ID, we cannot rule out a minor contribution from an AGN based solely on the observed fluxes. These results indicate that classical diagnostics can be significantly biased in high-redshift galaxies and that self-consistent, physically motivated tools are therefore essential to properly interpret the complex ISM conditions and chemical enrichment in the early Universe."}

The Living Worlds Community Working Group was charged with investigating how HWO could characterize planets orbiting stars in the solar neighborhood, search for signs of life, and interpret potential biosignatures within a false positive and false negative framework. The Surface Biosignatures Task assessed the measurement requirements and instrument needs to detect these biosignatures under an 'Earth through time' scenario. Surface biosignatures are planetary-scale spectral features resulting from absorption and/or scattering of radiation by organisms containing photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic pigments. This secondary class of biosignature can be used to corroborate atmospheric biosignatures by providing multiple lines of evidence to aid in assessing their biogenicity. Furthermore, surface biopigments are the only way to detect more primitive forms of anoxygenic photosynthesis if oxygenic photosynthesis never evolved. Key Findings: To detect biopigments on the surface of planets under Archean, Proterozoic, and Modern atmospheric compositions (15 percent coverage, 50 percent cloud cover), an SNR of 20-40 would be needed over 500-1100 nm. However, there may be some cases in which lower SNR is required; studies are ongoing. Coronagraph requirements: (1) The detection of surface biosignatures would be greatly enhanced by having as many parallel coronagraph channels as possible across the entire wavelength range with no or minimal gaps between channels. (2) Retrieval studies revealed that restricted wavelength ranges (e.g., 0.4 - 0.7 microns), such as may be used during initial survey strategies, are not sufficient to deconvolve the biopigment features from the abiotic background."}

The electron pressure profile is a convenient tool to characterize the thermodynamical state of a galaxy cluster, with several studies adopting a \"universal\" functional form.\n  Aims. This study aims at using Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) data to test four different functional forms for the cluster pressure profile: generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW), $β$-model, polytropic, and exponential. The goal is to assess to what level they are universal over a population-level cluster sample.\n  Methods. A set of 3496 ACT-DR4 galaxy clusters, spanning the mass range $[10^{14},10^{15.1}]\\,\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ and the redshift range $[0,2]$, is stacked on the ACT-DR6 Compton parameter $y$ map over $\\sim13,000\\,\\text{deg}^2$. An angular Compton profile is then extracted and modeled using the theoretical pressure recipes, whose free parameters are constrained against the measurement via a multi-stage MCMC approach. The analysis is repeated over cluster subsamples spanning smaller mass and redshift ranges.\n  Results. All functional forms are effective in reproducing the measured $y$ profiles within their error bars, without a clearly favored model. While best-fit estimates are in broad agreement with previous findings, hints of residual subsample dependency are detected favoring higher amplitudes and steeper profiles in high-mass, low-redshift clusters.\n  Conclusions. Population-level cluster studies based on SZ data alone are likely unable to accurately constrain different pressure profile models. Residual trends at population level and scatter at individual cluster level undermine the universal pressure model assumption whenever high precision is required. Finally, functional forms different from the gNFW prove equally effective while being more physically motivated."}

X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeating, high-amplitude, soft X-ray bursts observed from the nuclei of a dozen nearby low-mass galaxies. Their origin remains a puzzle in the physics of accretion variability. Observational data indicate that X-ray and/or optical tidal disruption events (TDEs) may precede QPE detections. Although both kinds of outburst are driven by supermassive black holes, they are more frequently detected in faded active galactic nuclei (AGNs), when the TDE is not happening in a dormant galaxy. In the case of the QPE discovery source, GSN 069, it remains debated whether its past activity arose from a previous AGN phase or from an enhanced TDE rate. Aims. We investigated the origin of the past nuclear activity in GSN 069. Methods. Past AGN activity imprints detectable polarization in optical light, due to the expected delay between direct and scattered light. On 6 September 2019, we targeted GSN 069 with VLT/FORS2 in both imaging polarimetry and spectropolarimetry modes so that its optical polarization could be investigated while the first detected QPE phase was still active. Results. We measured a rising polarization, from ~0% to ~1.5%, as moving away from the nucleus of GSN 069. This rise is probed to be intrinsic to the central engine, confirming the already detected extended emission line region (EELR) by integral field unit data. Conclusions. The increasing radial polarization demonstrates a switched-off nucleus. The polarization angle traces an axis aligned with elongated [OIII], [NII], and Hα gas distributions, revealing an EELR that may be consistent with relic polarization cones, therefore suggesting the presence of a torus-like structure in the past. Thus, optical polarization echoes geometrically favor a faded AGN as the origin of the EELR rather than a past elevated TDE rate, although the latter cannot be excluded."}

Referee received Nov 19 2025, accepted Jan 13 2026", "summary": "Recent space-based observations discovered several unusual objects, exhibiting similar properties, at redshifts $z\\gtrsim 10$. Among them is the UHZ1 system at $z=10.1$, containing $\\sim 10^8M_\\odot$ in stars, with a similarly massive central black hole of $\\sim 10^{7-8}M_\\odot$. Here we propose a possible mechanism for forming such systems which hinges on the presence of primordial black holes (PBHs) covering a range of masses while contributing a significant fraction of the dark matter (DM). We evaluate the accurate expression for the small-scale power responsible for the collapse of the first halos in the presence of the PBH population. The extra power in the matter density field, produced by the granulation term, will cause an earlier collapse of DM halos, populated by PBHs of different masses. In these collapsed and virialized systems the PBHs will undergo 2-body relaxation, driving the more massive PBHs to the halo center under dynamical friction. We quantify this evolution for a distribution of PBH orbital parameters and halo properties. The analysis shows that PBHs can have appropriate mass functions capable of producing systems with parameters similar to what is observed for UHZ1. We suggest that the proposed mechanism could account for a subset of other systems newly discovered with the JWST at high redshifts, including the Little Red Dots."}

Accepted to A&A", "summary": "We investigate the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) at ~100 pc scales in a sample of 27 nearby luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) spanning the entire merger sequence. In particular, we study the relations between star-formation (SF) and molecular gas surface density as a function of the interaction stage using two complementary approaches: beam-sized (unresolved, line-of-sight) regions and physically identified molecular gas clumps. To map the distribution of molecular gas we use ALMA CO(2-1) observations, while SF is traced using HST Pa-alpha or Pa-beta images. We derive spatially resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relations for each galaxy. When using beam-sized regions, we find that 67% of galaxies follow a single relation between Sigma_SFR and Sigma_H2. However, in the remaining galaxies, the relation splits into two branches, indicating the presence of a duality in this relation. In contrast, when using physical gas clumps, the duality disappears and all galaxies show a single trend. We also study other ISM/clump properties as a function of the merger stage. We find that isolated galaxies and systems in early stages of interaction exhibit lower amounts of gas and SF. As the merger progresses, however, the amount of gas in the central kpc of the galaxy undergoing the merger increases, along with the SFR, and the slope of the KS relation becomes steeper, indicating an increase in SF efficiency of the gas clumps. Clumps in late-stage mergers are predominantly located at small distances from the nucleus, confirming that most of the activity is concentrated in the central regions. Finally, the relation between the SF efficiency and the boundedness parameter evolves from being roughly flat in the early stages of the merger to becoming positive in the final phases, indicating that clump self-gravity only starts to regulate the SF process between the early- and mid-merger stages."}

For the shorter-wavelength filters, the background is understood to be dominated by airglow; however, what precisely drives background variations is not well constrained for any filter. Here, we explore the causes of the background variation. Using over 8,000 archival SBC observations, we developed a machine learning model that can accurately predict the background for an observation, based upon a set of 23 observational parameters. This model indicates that, depending on filter, the SBC background is generally dominated by Solar elevation, Solar separation angle, Earth limb angle of observation, SBC temperature, and target Galactic latitude."}

As in stripped nuclear star clusters, the SMBHs in UCDs may be fed by stellar winds from old stellar populations, in the absence of substantial gas reservoirs and galactic inflows. In this work, we investigate such a wind-fed accretion scenario for M60-UCD1, which harbors a confirmed $2\\times10^7~M_\\odot$ SMBH and exhibits X-ray emission suggestive of SMBH accretion signature. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we simulate the SMBH accreting stellar winds from approximately 1500 asymptotic giant branch stars, and explore the role of ram pressure from the ambient interstellar or intracluster medium. After 5 Myr, the majority of the stellar winds form a cold gas disk ($\\sim1000~M_\\odot$) within $\\sim10~\\rm pc$ as well as the SMBH's gravitational sphere of influence. Within the inner $10^4~r_{\\rm g}$, this disk transitions into a hot ($\\sim10^7-10^9~\\rm K$), geometrically thick corona that dominates the X-ray emission. The SMBH achieves an accretion rate of $\\sim10^{-5}~M_\\odot~\\rm yr^{-1}$, yielding an X-ray luminosity of $\\sim7\\times10^{37}~\\rm erg~s^{-1}$, well consistent with observations. Including ram pressure stripping reduces both the accretion rate and luminosity by about a factor of two.

For each FRB, the catalog provides a $O(10')$ estimate of sky location along with corresponding measurements of cumulative exposure time and survey sensitivity over the observing period. It includes a total-intensity dynamic spectrum between 400 and 800 MHz at 0.983 ms resolution. From this spectrum, we constrain a model of the burst morphology and measure key parameters such as arrival time, intrinsic temporal width, dispersion measure, scattering time, and flux density. This second catalog includes all FRBs from the first catalog, with every event reprocessed using a uniform and improved analysis framework. We show that previously published inferences remain valid under the updated measurements.

By construction,the code can also be used to select objects that contaminate the high-z quasar population, i.e. brown dwarfs and early-type galaxies at intermediate redshifts. The code can be adapted for the selection of high-z galaxies, and although it has been tuned to the Euclid Wide Survey, it can be easily adapted to other photometric surveys. The code input data are the object's photometric data and its galactic longitude and latitude, and the code output data are the probabilities of the modelled populations of high-z quasars, brown dwarfs and early-type galaxies at intermediate redshift. As part of the validation, Owl-z could re-identify all spectroscopically confirmed quasars at z \\geq 7, demonstrating the code's versatility in applying to different photometric catalogues. The performance of Owl-z, based on a metric combining completeness and purity called F-measure, is analysed in the case of Euclid using simulated data in a wide range of redshifts (7 \\leq z \\leq 12) and H-band Euclid magnitudes (18 \\leq H_E \\leq 24.5). The results show that Owl-z reaches full performance for bright sources (H_E \\lesssim 22), independently of the redshift. We show that the probability threshold used to select promising quasar candidates can be adjusted after processing to fine-tune the F-measure value of candidates depending on their magnitude and redshift estimates. We show that for objects brighter than about two magnitudes above the survey detection limit, Owl-z provides a classification that will facilitate the optimisation of photometric and spectroscopic confirmation campaigns. In conclusion, Owl-z is a powerful public tool to help select high-z quasars, brown dwarfs or early-type galaxies at intermediate redshifts in Euclid or other wide-field surveys."}

Combining Doppler time-series with astrometry, and in particular with proper motion anomalies technique, it is possible to put strong constraints on their orbital inclination and true mass. This work aims to present a model that combines Hipparcos and Gaia astrometric data with radial velocity measurements to constrain the orbital inclinations and true masses of long-period companions. Additionally, we re-analyse a small sample of targets that have not yet been studied using this combined approach. This research leverages the simultaneous modelling of proper motion anomalies and radial velocities, in conjunction with an analysis of the sensitivity curve. This approach serves not only as a verification of the parameters but also as a means to acquire valuable insights into planetary systems. The new analyses reveal that some of the targets classified as brown dwarfs or small-mass stars have a planetary nature. HD 5388 b and HD 6718 b are likely planets. HD 141937 b is likely a planet, but the current dataset does not allow us to firmly constrain its true mass. HD 16760 b belongs to the brown dwarf regime and it has a probable second companion. 30 Ari B b falls within the stellar regime, but the presence of an additional stellar companion could compromise the reliability of the final results.

We investigate how lens mass-profile assumptions affect time delays. Specifically, we implement a Broken Power Law (BPL) mass model within the Lenstronomy framework (Birrer & Amara 2018), which introduces additional flexibility in the radial mass distribution and can phenomenologically capture deviations from a single power-law profile. This model is combined with a numerical approach to compute time delays at the image positions. We validate the BPL implementation using simulated lenses and compare the results with those obtained from the elliptical power-law (EPL) model. We then apply both model families to the quadruply imaged quasar WGD~2038-4008. Both models fit the imaging and kinematic data comparably well, yet the greater radial freedom in the BPL model shifts the inferred time-delay distance -- and thus $H_0$ -- by an amount comparable to the current discrepancy between early- and late-universe $H_0$ estimates. In a flat $Λ$CDM cosmology, the $H_0$ inferred using the BPL lens model is $75^{+23.1}_{-16.3} \\ \\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1} \\ Mpc^{-1}},$ while the EPL model gives $H_0 = 61^{+19.2}_{-13.2} \\ \\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1} \\ Mpc^{-1}}.$ This difference is largely due to uncertainties in the inner mass profile ($θ<0.2''$), a region where point spread function (PSF) reconstruction is a critical factor -- a finding consistent with results reported in Shajib et al. (2022). This highlights how time-delay cosmography remains sensitive to assumptions about the lens mass profile. With current precision, this difference does not favor one cosmological scenario over another, but rather underscores the importance of flexible mass modeling and PSF modeling."}

However, it remains unclear whether quenching is primarily driven by one factor or results from a combination of mechanisms in individual GV galaxies. In this study, we address this question by examining the spatial distributions of star formation and molecular gas in 28 GVs selected from the ALMaQUEST survey and additional literature samples. For each galaxy, we identify regions with suppressed specific star formation rate (sSFR) and measure $Δf_{gas}$ and $Δ$SFE-offsets from the resolved scaling relations of the star-forming main sequence galaxies. By comparing the fraction of regions with negative $Δf_{gas}$ and $Δ$SFE, we classify 35.7$\\pm$13.2\\% (57.1$\\pm$17.9\\%) of GV galaxies as $f_{gas}$-driven, 39.3$\\pm$14.0\\% (39.3$\\pm$14.0\\%) as SFE-driven, and 25.0$\\pm$10.6\\% (3.6$\\pm$3.6\\%) as mixed mode when adopting a fixed (variable) CO-to-$\\rm H_{2}$ conversion factor ($α_{CO}$). These results indicate that GVs undergo quenching through multiple pathways. As sSFR decreases from the main sequence to the green valley, we observe a transition toward predominantly SFE-driven quenching, possibly linked to internal processes such as morphological quenching or AGN activity. We further estimate the quenching timescale ($τ_{decay}$), defined as the time from the peak SFR to 1/e (approximately 37\\%) of its value, using integrated MaNGA spectra. SFE-driven quenching is typically associated with short $τ_{decay}$ , while $f_{gas}$-driven quenching shows a broader range.

Small-sized stellar systems are therefore often used to set stringent constraints on ULDM. However, the evolution of systems with sizes well below the ULDM de Broglie wavelength remains poorly explored. Using numerical simulations, we show that the evolution of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos is governed by the interplay between internal stellar relaxation and ULDM-induced heating. We find the following main results. First, in sufficiently compact systems, relaxation-driven core collapse dominates, allowing the system to remain bound and dense, while ULDM-induced stripping of outer stars further accelerates the collapse. Second, in more extended systems, ULDM heating dominates and ultimately disrupts the system. Near the disruption threshold, we identify systems resembling ultra-faint dwarfs like Segue 1. Third, we further introduce a dimensionless parameter to quantify the relative importance of heating and relaxation and finally lead to an evolutionary phase diagram. Our results reveal the rich and nontrivial dynamics of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos, indicating that precise system modeling is essential for robust ULDM constraints."}

This UV field is a major agent of ionization and dissociation in the inner regions of molecular clouds that are shielded from the effects of the interstellar radiation field. In particular, the dissociation of $\\rm H_2$, by far the most abundant molecule in interstellar clouds, leads to the production of atomic hydrogen which then takes part in the production of a multitude of molecules, in particular complex organics on the surfaces of interstellar dust grains. Precise knowledge of the rates of CR-induced dissociation processes is thus crucial for constructing reliable chemical models. For the present paper, we have derived a new value of $k_{\\rm diss, CR}(\\mbox{$\\rm H_2$})=0.831ζ$ for the rate of $\\rm H_2$ dissociation, where $ζ$ is the CR ionization rate of $\\rm H_2$. This prediction contrasts a previous value from the Leiden database which overestimated the rate due to an inconsistent treatment of the $\\rm H_2$ abundances and photodissociation cross sections. By running a series of chemical models, we show that the overestimated dissociation rate has a large effect on the results of chemical simulations, with the abundance of methanol being overestimated by over one order of magnitude. Hence, we strongly recommend the adoption of our new estimate $k_{\\rm diss, CR}(\\mbox{$\\rm H_2$})=0.831ζ$ in all chemical models that include this process. Our newly derived value corresponds to $\\rm H_2$ being purely in the para form ($J^{\\prime\\prime} = 0$).

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) encode the integrated electron column density along their lines of sight, offering a unique probe of both the cosmic expansion rate ($H_0$) and the baryon density ($Ω_{\\rm b}$). However, constraints from FRBs alone suffer from a severe $H_0$-$Ω_{\\rm b}$ degeneracy that prevents them from resolving either problem independently. We show that this degeneracy can be broken by combining FRBs with other emerging probes whose degeneracy directions differ in the $H_0$-$Ω_{\\rm b}$ plane. Specifically, we quantify three multi-messenger approaches: FRBs paired with gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens, strong gravitational lensing (SGL) time delays, and 21 cm intensity mapping (IM). The combinations FRB+GW, FRB+SGL, and FRB+21 cm IM each deliver simultaneous constraints on $H_0$ and $Ω_{\\rm b}$ better than ($1\\%$, $1\\%$) in the $Λ$CDM model, ($1.5\\%$, $2\\%$) in the $w$CDM model, and ($2\\%$, $3.5\\%$) in the CPL model.

This discrepancy could be explained if the optical depth $τ$ inferred from the CMB large-scale E-mode polarization is underestimated, which may be biased by foreground-subtraction or instrumental systematics. In this work, we present a determination of $τ$ independent of the large-scale E-mode polarization, using the latest measurements of the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction $x_\\mathrm{HI}(z)$, which is constrained by Lyman-$α$ forest and damping-wing absorption measurements at $z\\sim5$-$14$, based on ground-based optical and JWST observations. Combining $x_\\mathrm{HI}(z)$ with the Planck CMB power spectra excluding the large-scale E-mode polarization, we obtain $τ=0.0552^{+0.0019}_{-0.0026}$, a stringent constraint consistent with the previous CMB results including the large-scale E-mode. We also evaluate a potential systematic error in our method associated with absorption modeling, obtaining $τ=0.0552^{+0.0075}_{-0.0049}$. Using this constraint on $τ$, we resolve the degeneracy in the $τ$-$Ω_m$ plane and find a $2.4σ$ tension with the DESI DR2 BAO results, thereby confirming the claimed mild discrepancy suggestive of physics beyond $Λ$CDM. Finally, we derive an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses, $Σm_ν<0.0550\\,(0.0717)$ eV at the 95% (99%) confidence level. This limit favors the normal mass ordering and, when combined with the lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments, yields a further constraint, $Σm_ν=0.0594_{-0.0007}^{+0.0113}$ eV.

Starobinsky's stochastic formalism has long been known to reproduce the leading logarithms of scalar potential models.

The electron pressure profile is a convenient tool to characterize the thermodynamical state of a galaxy cluster, with several studies adopting a \"universal\" functional form.\n  Aims. This study aims at using Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) data to test four different functional forms for the cluster pressure profile: generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW), $β$-model, polytropic, and exponential. The goal is to assess to what level they are universal over a population-level cluster sample.\n  Methods. A set of 3496 ACT-DR4 galaxy clusters, spanning the mass range $[10^{14},10^{15.1}]\\,\\text{M}_{\\odot}$ and the redshift range $[0,2]$, is stacked on the ACT-DR6 Compton parameter $y$ map over $\\sim13,000\\,\\text{deg}^2$. An angular Compton profile is then extracted and modeled using the theoretical pressure recipes, whose free parameters are constrained against the measurement via a multi-stage MCMC approach. The analysis is repeated over cluster subsamples spanning smaller mass and redshift ranges.\n  Results. All functional forms are effective in reproducing the measured $y$ profiles within their error bars, without a clearly favored model. While best-fit estimates are in broad agreement with previous findings, hints of residual subsample dependency are detected favoring higher amplitudes and steeper profiles in high-mass, low-redshift clusters.\n  Conclusions. Population-level cluster studies based on SZ data alone are likely unable to accurately constrain different pressure profile models. Residual trends at population level and scatter at individual cluster level undermine the universal pressure model assumption whenever high precision is required. Finally, functional forms different from the gNFW prove equally effective while being more physically motivated."}

Proto-binary and multiple systems with close separations are particularly valuable targets for investigating chemical inheritance and reaction, as their members are expected to form from similar material in their parental cloud. We present ALMA observations of the hierarchical proto-triple system HOPS-288, focusing on the physical structure, kinematics, and COM compositions. The system is treated as a proto-binary system consisting of HOPS-288-A and HOPS-288-B due to the limited spatial resolutions, with a separation of 200~au. Three COM-rich features are revealed: two hot corinos associated with the two members, rich in a variety of COMs, and an intervening component between the two members traced by CH$_3$OH and tentatively by CH$_3$CHO. The hot corino in HOPS-288-A exhibits rotational features and might trace a disk. The hot corino in HOPS-288-B is also possibly exhibiting rotational motion. The intervening component could possibly trace a shocked region in the circumbinary disk or a bridge between the two members. The column densities of COMs, including $^{13}$CH$_3$OH, CH$_2$DOH, CH$_3$CHO, HCOOCH$_3$, C$_2$H$_5$OH, $^{13}$CH$_3$CN, and NH$_2$CHO, are broadly similar between the two sources, possibly suggesting the complex organic similarities among proto-binary/multiple systems. Given the complexity of the studied physical structures, further detailed investigations will be essential to confirm this result."}

A firm identification of the source of the NG15 signal requires an accurate reconstruction of its frequency spectrum. In this paper, we provide such a spectral characterization of the NG15 signal based on a piecewise power-law (PPL) ansatz that strikes a balance between existing alternatives in the literature. Our PPL reconstruction is more flexible than the standard constant-power-law model, which describes the GWB spectrum in terms of only two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index gamma. Concurrently, it better approximates physically realistic GWB spectra -- especially those of cosmological origin -- than the free spectral model, since the latter allows for arbitrary variations in the GWB amplitude from one frequency bin to the next. Our PPL reconstruction of the NG15 signal relies on individual PPL models with a fixed number of internal nodes (i.e., constant power law, broken power law, doubly broken power law, etc.) that are ultimately combined in a Bayesian model average. The data products resulting from our analysis provide the basis for fast refits of spectral GWB models."}

We investigate how lens mass-profile assumptions affect time delays. Specifically, we implement a Broken Power Law (BPL) mass model within the Lenstronomy framework (Birrer & Amara 2018), which introduces additional flexibility in the radial mass distribution and can phenomenologically capture deviations from a single power-law profile. This model is combined with a numerical approach to compute time delays at the image positions. We validate the BPL implementation using simulated lenses and compare the results with those obtained from the elliptical power-law (EPL) model. We then apply both model families to the quadruply imaged quasar WGD~2038-4008. Both models fit the imaging and kinematic data comparably well, yet the greater radial freedom in the BPL model shifts the inferred time-delay distance -- and thus $H_0$ -- by an amount comparable to the current discrepancy between early- and late-universe $H_0$ estimates. In a flat $Λ$CDM cosmology, the $H_0$ inferred using the BPL lens model is $75^{+23.1}_{-16.3} \\ \\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1} \\ Mpc^{-1}},$ while the EPL model gives $H_0 = 61^{+19.2}_{-13.2} \\ \\mathrm{km \\ s^{-1} \\ Mpc^{-1}}.$ This difference is largely due to uncertainties in the inner mass profile ($θ<0.2''$), a region where point spread function (PSF) reconstruction is a critical factor -- a finding consistent with results reported in Shajib et al. (2022). This highlights how time-delay cosmography remains sensitive to assumptions about the lens mass profile. With current precision, this difference does not favor one cosmological scenario over another, but rather underscores the importance of flexible mass modeling and PSF modeling."}

Small-sized stellar systems are therefore often used to set stringent constraints on ULDM. However, the evolution of systems with sizes well below the ULDM de Broglie wavelength remains poorly explored. Using numerical simulations, we show that the evolution of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos is governed by the interplay between internal stellar relaxation and ULDM-induced heating. We find the following main results. First, in sufficiently compact systems, relaxation-driven core collapse dominates, allowing the system to remain bound and dense, while ULDM-induced stripping of outer stars further accelerates the collapse. Second, in more extended systems, ULDM heating dominates and ultimately disrupts the system. Near the disruption threshold, we identify systems resembling ultra-faint dwarfs like Segue 1. Third, we further introduce a dimensionless parameter to quantify the relative importance of heating and relaxation and finally lead to an evolutionary phase diagram. Our results reveal the rich and nontrivial dynamics of compact stellar systems in ULDM halos, indicating that precise system modeling is essential for robust ULDM constraints."}

These observations show the morphologies and kinematics of the collimated jets from three protostars, the low-mass Class 0 protostars B335 and HOPS 153, and the intermediate-mass protostar HOPS 370. These jets are traced by shock-ionized fine-structure line emission observed with the JWST NIRSpec and MIRI IFUs. We find that [Fe II] emission traces the full extent of the inner 1000 to 2000 au of the jets, depending on distance to the protostar, while other ions mostly trace isolated shocked knots. The jets show evidence of wiggling motion in the plane of the sky as well as asymmetries between blue and red-shifted lobes. The widths of the jets increase non-monotonically with distance from the central protostar, with opening angles ranging from 2.1 degrees to < 10.1 degrees for the three protostars in the sample. The jets have total velocities ranging from 147 to 184 km/s after correcting for disk inclination. For B335, an 8-month gap between NIRSpec and MIRI MRS observations enabled measurement of the tangential velocity of a shocked knot; in combination with the radial velocity, this shows that the jet has a different inclination than the outflow cavity. We find multiple knots before and during a recent outburst in B335, although the knots were more frequent during the burst. The asymmetries between blue- and red-shifted lobes strongly suggest complex interactions between the circumstellar disks and magnetic fields."}

This discrepancy could be explained if the optical depth $τ$ inferred from the CMB large-scale E-mode polarization is underestimated, which may be biased by foreground-subtraction or instrumental systematics. In this work, we present a determination of $τ$ independent of the large-scale E-mode polarization, using the latest measurements of the redshift evolution of the neutral hydrogen fraction $x_\\mathrm{HI}(z)$, which is constrained by Lyman-$α$ forest and damping-wing absorption measurements at $z\\sim5$-$14$, based on ground-based optical and JWST observations.

We also evaluate a potential systematic error in our method associated with absorption modeling, obtaining $τ=0.0552^{+0.0075}_{-0.0049}$. Using this constraint on $τ$, we resolve the degeneracy in the $τ$-$Ω_m$ plane and find a $2.4σ$ tension with the DESI DR2 BAO results, thereby confirming the claimed mild discrepancy suggestive of physics beyond $Λ$CDM. Finally, we derive an upper limit on the sum of neutrino masses, $Σm_ν<0.0550\\,(0.0717)$ eV at the 95% (99%) confidence level. This limit favors the normal mass ordering and, when combined with the lower limits from neutrino oscillation experiments, yields a further constraint, $Σm_ν=0.0594_{-0.0007}^{+0.0113}$ eV. However, the cosmological upper limit and the oscillation-based lower limit show a mild $2.2σ$ tension, providing an independent indication of possible physics beyond $Λ$CDM."}
