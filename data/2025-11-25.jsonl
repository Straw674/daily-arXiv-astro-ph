Accepted for publication in A&A. Comments welcome", "summary": "The radio continuum spectra of pulsars (PSRs) exhibit a wide variety of shapes, that are interpreted as pure and broken power laws, power laws with turnovers or cut-offs, and logarithmic-parabolic profiles. A notable fraction of these have well-defined power laws with $ν^{-2.1}$ exponential turnovers, indicative of free-free thermal absorption along the line-of-site. We analyse a sample of 63 PSRs with such spectral shapes, compiled from four previously published studies, to investigate their statistical properties. We normalise each spectrum to a characteristic frequency and flux density of its own, facilitating a consistent treatment across the four sub-samples. We show these two fitted parameters are correlated by a power law, with its slope reflecting the median spectral index ($α\\sim -2.0$) of PSR emission. We found that the turnover frequencies in our sample are typically high, clustering around 558 MHz, implying notably high emission measures ($EM \\sim 10^{5}$ pc cm$^{-6}$) for an inferred thermal absorbing medium with electron temperature of $T_{\\mathrm{e}}=8000$ K. Moreover, by combining these $EM$ with dispersion measures (DM) derived from pulse time delays, we break the degeneracy between electron density and path length of the absorbers. This reveals a discrete near-in population of absorbers characterised by small sizes ($L \\sim 0.1\\,\\text{pc}$) and high electron densities $(n_{\\mathrm{e}} \\sim 10^{3}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3} $)), which exhibit a clear size-density anticorrelation reminiscent of that observed in Galactic and extragalactic H$_\\rm{II}$ regions."}

In addition to depleting the gas reservoir of galaxies, outflows also enrich their circumgalactic medium (CGM) with processed gas -- which can further impact the next stages of gas accretion, resulting in the presence of molecular gas beyond the stellar component of galaxies, out to CGM scales. Here, we aim to search for cold molecular gas (MH2) in the CGM of typical main-sequence (MS) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at cosmic noon (zmed=1.3), where we expect outflows to be particularly prominent. Using Band 3 CO(2-1) data from the Atacama Large Millimeter and submillimeter Array (ALMA), we study the spatial extent of the MH2 of a sample of 26 SFGs, via stacking techniques. We compare this extent to that of the stacked stellar emission of our sample traced by UltraVISTA Ks band data. We also search for broad wings in the stacked spectrum which can be indicative of ongoing outflows. Within the noise level of the observations, we find that the total intrinsic MH2 of our sample spatially extends to scales of ~12 kpc, similarly to the stellar emission (~13 kpc). We do not find broad wings in the stacked spectrum that could hint at ongoing molecular outflows, but we find a tentative minor excess of CO(2-1) emission at negative velocities that might be indicative of outflows, where the redshifted gas is optically thick. The absence of high-velocity molecular gas suggests that molecular outflows traced by CO(2-1) emission are weak in MS SFGs at cosmic noon. These weak outflows thus fail to expel a significant amount of molecular gas to CGM scales, as indicated by the absence of molecular emission extending beyond the stellar emission region. This lack of CO emission at large radii could also imply that the molecular gas does not survive at such distances."}

However, such indications may instead arise from the intrinsic likelihood geometry of individual datasets, residual inter-probe tension, or restrictive priors. These factors can mimic evidence for dynamical dark energy. To clarify these issues, we perform a controlled null test. We use realistic mock BAO, CMB, and Type~Ia supernova datasets generated from a common fiducial LambdaCDM cosmology. These mocks include the DESI~DR2 BAO covariance, the Planck~2018 distance-prior covariance, and the full Pantheon+ SH0ES supernova covariance. This setup isolates physical information from geometric or statistical effects in the CPL parametrization. We find that individual probes and most two-probe combinations show apparent deviations in the (w0,wa) plane. These could be mistaken for phantom crossing or evolving dark energy. Two-probe combinations including supernovae (BAO+SNe, CMB+SNe) recover values near (w0,wa)=(-1,0) but fail to reconstruct (Omegam0,H0), because SNe do not determine the absolute distance scale. Combinations without SNe (BAO+CMB), as well as any single dataset, retain strong degeneracy directions. These produce significant shifts driven purely by likelihood geometry. These behaviors arise because BAO, CMB, and SNe each constrain only one principal direction in (w0,wa) space. Their degeneracy ridges are misaligned due to distinct redshift sensitivities. In contrast, the full BAO+CMB+SNe likelihood with proper covariance breaks all degeneracies simultaneously. It cleanly recovers the fiducial cosmology, including (w0,wa)=(-1,0) and (Omegam0,H0). Our results provide a transparent benchmark for assessing future claims of omega(z) neq -1. They emphasize the need for complete multi-probe analyses with flexible H0 and rd priors."}

This evolution mirrors the improvement in our understanding of environments that may harbor life. The bulk planetary chemistry governs the habitability of a planet, which is in turn set by the early solar system environment and planet formation processes. Therefore, investigations of solar and exoplanetary systems as a whole would provide insights into the factors that make a planet habitable. Bulk planetary chemistry govern planetary atmospheres, core sizes, magnetic fields, heat engines, volatile inventories, and silicate mantle compositions.

Many high-z galaxies and nearby analogs exhibit strong He II emission, indicating an abundance of photons with energies >54.4 eV that standard single-star population models cannot explain. Recent studies show that binary evolution and non-solar abundance patterns are required to explain the distinct spectra of high-z galaxies observed by JWST. However, treatments of these properties vary drastically between models. We present the first results from a comparison of models with different treatments of binaries, including BPASS and novel stripped star models, with rest-UV-optical spectra of high-z galaxies' local analogs. This type of investigation can provide insights into which aspects of binary evolution are important to reproduce observations and identify priorities in ongoing efforts to improve models. By constraining the properties of massive stars at high redshift, we can learn about the processes at play in high-z galaxies and massive star evolution more broadly."}

Submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "We present a new prescription for the halo mass function (HMF) built upon the Evolution Mapping framework. This approach provides a physical motivation to parametrise the non-universality of the HMF in terms of the recent history of structure formation and the local shape of the linear matter power spectrum. Our model was calibrated against measurements from N-body simulations, with halo samples defined by ten overdensity thresholds, $Δ$, ranging from 150 to 1600 times the mean background matter density. For our reference mass definition, $Δ=200$, the calibrated fitting function achieves per cent-level accuracy across a wide range of masses, redshifts, and structure formation histories, and maintains this performance when tested on cosmologies with different linear power spectrum shapes. This high level of accuracy is maintained across other mass definitions, degrading only slightly to the 5 per cent level at the highest values of $Δ$. We also provide fitting formulae to interpolate the parameters as a function of $Δ$, which allows for accurate modelling of HMFs defined by intermediate overdensities, with accuracy still well within 5 per cent when tested on halo catalogues defined by the virial overdensity threshold. Compared to other commonly used recipes, our prescription yields competitive or superior accuracy across all redshifts and cosmologies, successfully capturing the non-universal features of the HMF where other models exhibit systematic deviations. This work provides a high-precision modelling tool for cluster abundance analyses, and demonstrates the power of the evolution mapping framework for building accurate models of observables in the non-linear regime."}

The goal of our method is to maximize the exploitation of available archival interferometric data. By stacking visibilities of galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts directly in the Fourier domain and transforming them into the rest-frame, we can enhance the stacked signal, suppress noise, and improve image reconstruction thanks to an extended coverage of the visibility domain. The ViSta method is highly flexible, allowing stacking of visibilities regardless of the array configuration or spectral setup. It is effective for both targeted sources and spurious detections offset from the phase center, whether unresolved or extended, within the field of view of the telescope. We validated the method using simulated interferometric datasets. For point-like sources, we can reconstruct the true emission with approximately 90% accuracy, obtaining similar results to classical image-plane stacking. In contrast, for faint and extended sources below the noise level, our method can provide a more accurate estimate of the signal compared to traditional image-based approaches. Finally, we applied ViSta to a sample of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) to detect the CO(3-2) emission line. As for the simulated case, we demonstrated that our tool performs better than image-plane stacking when the signal from individual sources is no longer easily detectable, achieving higher SNR. Finally, we outline potential future applications of this stacking approach."}

This complementary description is applied using one of the most prevalent methodologies: categorization using the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix extracted from the matter density field. We integrated our findings into a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, combined with cosmological numerical simulations, to analyze how the intrinsic properties of galaxies are influenced by environmental changes. In our study, we find a continuous distribution of eigenvalue ratios, revealing a clear dependence of galaxy properties on their surrounding environments. This method allowed us to identify critical values at which transitions in the behavior of key astrophysical galaxy properties become evident."}

We categorized these galaxies into three groups based on the deviation of each global SFR from the star-forming main sequence (MS), $Δ$MS: upper MS (UMS), MS, and lower MS (LMS). UMS galaxies tend to be less massive or barred spiral galaxies, exhibiting molecular gas fraction ($f_{\\mathrm{gas}}$) comparable to those of MS galaxies but higher star formation efficiency (SFE). In contrast, the LMS galaxies tend to be massive or active galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Their $f_{\\mathrm{gas}}$ values are lower than those of MS galaxies, and their SFEs are slightly lower or comparable to those of MS galaxies in the inner region. These trends indicate that enhanced SFE contributes to higher $Δ$MS values, whereas reduced $f_{\\mathrm{gas}}$ results in lower $Δ$MS values. The less prominent bulge or the presence of a bar structure in UMS galaxies induces disk-wide star formation, consequently increasing the SFE. In LMS galaxies, the molecular gas is exhausted, and their star formation activity is low. Environmental effects, such as tidal gas stripping, may also reduce gas supply from the outer regions. Furthermore, our sample galaxies show that both the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and $f_{\\mathrm{gas}}$ decrease in the central region in LMS galaxies but did not change in the same region in UMS galaxies. These results seem to support the inside-out quenching of star formation although the dominant cause of depletion remains uncertain."}

To solve this problem, we present a flexible, data-driven method: the GausSian PIxelwise Conditional Estimator (GSPICE) that models an ensemble of spectra as a multivariate Gaussian and estimates the expected value and expected variance of each pixel in each spectrum conditional on others. GSPICE compares observed fluxes and errors to its own flux and error estimates to reveal outliers, which then can be completely masked or replaced by their estimates. We apply GSPICE to 3.9 million stellar spectra from the LAMOST survey, and show that variations of the method can directly identify and correct both individual pixel-level outliers (e.g., from cosmic ray hits) as well as extended systematic features (e.g., from incorrect wavelength calibrations), while still providing a novel characterization of the true per-pixel measurement uncertainties. We also demonstrate how GSPICE can take advantage of data partitioning with an application to diffuse interstellar bands.

Here, we describe a deep 3mm ALMA survey in long-baselines on a 1x1arcmin2 region in the Hubble Deep Field South, also covered by the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) in order to assess resolved molecular gas properties in galaxies in group environments at z>1. ALMA observations comprising a 4-pointing mosaic with a single Band3 (3mm) spectral tuning were conducted to cover CO transitions from different groups identified by MUSE. This work consists in a total effective time on source of 61h in configurations with up to 15km baselines. The final data-set yields an angular resolution of 0.15\"-0.2\" (imaging weights dependent) and maximum recoverable scales of 1\"-2\". The final continuum map reaches a sensitivity of rms~2uJy/beam, allowing the detection of three sources at 3mm (only one showing multi-wavelength counterparts). Moreover, we detect six line emitters associated with CO J=2-1 at zspec=1.284, one of them previously undetected by MUSE and none detected in 3mm continuum. The inter-stellar medium gas masses range from ~2E9 to ~9E10 Msun (adopting alphaCO=4Msun/(K.km/s.pc2), including Helium). Overall, this galaxy group is quite diverse with no two galaxies alike, some showing clear physical offsets with respect to Hubble imaging tracing rest-frame ultra-violet emission. We also derive cosmic molecular gas mass densities using this sample as a reference for group environments, and we find that these yield comparable densities as the galaxy population found in field environments."}

Accepted for publication in Nuclear Physics, Section B (Manuscript ID: NPB-D-25-00997)", "summary": "In the context of fitting cosmological models, parameter degeneracy remains a central issue. This paper critically examines traditional methods for constraining parameters and focuses on the G factor as a tool for evaluating the quality of observational data. To ensure analytical independence, two datasets--Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO)--were utilized as samples for parameter fitting, supplemented by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. The Figure of Merit (FoM) matrix served as the final criterion for assessing fitting performance. The results show that the G factor of the CC dataset increases linearly with redshift z, whereas the G factor of the BAO dataset follows a cubic relationship. Further analysis indicates that the FoM value for datasets with high G factors is significantly higher than that for datasets with low G factors, thereby validating the G factor's effectiveness as a tool for assessing observational data quality and reducing parameter degeneracy. This suggests that the G factor may serve as a diagnostic tool and selection criterion for optimizing observational datasets in future research."}

These techniques rely on a clear understanding of the rotational motion of the debris targets, which is challenging to constrain from unresolved imaging. The Ajisai satellite provides an ideal test case for developing and demonstrating these techniques due to its simple geometry and well constrained spin behaviour. We present four observations of the Ajisai satellite taken with SuperWASP in August of 2019, where high cadence photometry was extracted from streaked images as a part of a larger survey of Low Earth Orbit. We develop an MCMC-driven method to determine the spin-state of Ajisai by comparing the alignment between a map of modelled mirror positions and a novel derived map of surface reflectivity. We generally find good agreement within the expectation and uncertainties set by empirical models and our determined spin-state solutions align the surface reflectivity map and modelled mirror location well. Our results show that streak photometry can be used to recover the spin-axis and rotation period of fast-spinning objects such as Ajisai using modest ground-based instrumentation, making it readily scalable to a wider range of targets and observatories."}

We performed a Gaussian decomposition of the C$^{18}$O spectra to disentangle multiple velocity components along the line-of-sight and a `Friends-of-Friends' algorithm on these decomposed components to identify 24 velocity-coherent filaments in the observed region. The `FellWalker' algorithm is applied on the N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ integrated intensity map to identify the dense cores embedded within the filaments. Many of the filaments previously identified from the Herschel survey are found to contain multiple velocity-coherent filaments. Virial analysis indicated that all of our identified filaments are thermally supercritical and gravitationally bound. Velocity gradients are observed along the filaments in the vicinity of embedded dense cores, indicating the presence of longitudinal flows that contribute to core formation. The median mass flow rate across the observed region is estimated to be $\\sim$35 M$_{\\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$, with Serpens South showing a rate $\\sim$40\\% higher than W40. The analysis of non-thermal motions revealed that the dense cores mainly show subsonic to transonic motions, while their host filaments are mostly supersonic, suggesting that the turbulent motions in filaments may dissipate on smaller scales, allowing core formation. These findings highlight the essential role of the filaments' criticality, mass flow, and turbulent dissipation in the formation of dense cores within the filaments."}

When dark matter substructure possesses sufficient perturbations, it may lead to the formation of extra images in otherwise canonical doubly or quadruply imaged systems. With the advent of increasingly precise observational instruments, previously undetectable images may become measurable and image number anomalies therefore could be an increasingly viable method. In this paper, we utilize the gravitational lensing phenomenon of image number anomaly to derive constraints on dark matter substructure. We present the extra images induced by distinct forms of DM substructure, specifically primordial black holes (PBHs) and fuzzy dark matter (FDM) and show that higher angular resolution observations increase the probability of detecting additional lensed images. Based on a null detection of image number anomalies in a sample of 3500 lens systems generated from the \\textit{Strong Lensing Halo model-based mock catalogs} (SL-Hammocks), we derive upper limits on the abundance of PBHs. At the 95\\% confidence level, the PBH abundance is constrained to $\\lesssim 0.125\\%$, $0.08\\%$, and $0.04\\%$ for PBH masses in the range $\\sim 10^{7}$--$10^{9}~M_{\\odot}$, corresponding to angular resolutions of $0.1''$, $0.05''$, and $0.01''$, respectively.

Furthermore, the abundance of PBHs $\\lesssim 0.9\\%$ could be constrained at an angular resolution of $0.5''$ for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Observations. Finally, we discuss methodologies for identifying image number anomalies in special cases and demonstrate feasibility using a fitting procedure."}

The current candidate vetting process requires human experts to identify the frequency ranges and the time windows associated with any data quality issues present. Differences in judgment between human experts may cause inconsistency, making results difficult to reproduce across gravitational wave events. We present GSpyNetTreeS, an extension to GSpyNetTree based on the You Only Look Once algorithm, for the automatic detection, classification, and time-frequency localization of detector noise transients. As a proof of concept, we tested GSpyNetTreeS's performance on the data collected by the LIGO detectors during the third observing run for gravitational waves as well as common detector glitch classes included in GSpyNetTree: Blip, Low frequency blip, Low frequency line and Scratchy. We also demonstrated that GSpyNetTreeS is capable of accurately identifying common glitch classes and capturing the frequency and time information associated with detected detector noise transients, establishing its potential as an automatic event validation tool for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's observing runs."}

The merger orbits for the matched pairs in the TNG100-1 and the TNG100-1-Dark simulations are similar right after infall, and both evolve to more head-on orbits at final stages, with smaller changes in the hydrodynamical simulation.

In the presence of anisotropy this universe generally features rotation, in the sense that the principal axes of anisotropic expansion rotate with respect to the cosmic comoving frame. We focus in particular on the minimal case of two superfluids in 2+1 dimensions. The momentum constraint enforces their spatial gradients to be collinear and the dynamics tends to align such a direction with that of maximal expansion at late times. As opposed to the recently studied case of solids, rotation plays a more important role in the present two-superfluids model. The associated energy density does not dilute away but scales as that of anisotropy and affects the total equation of state. We find that purely non-rotating solutions correspond to an unstable surface in phase space in the direction of non-vanishing rotation. This suggests that rotation is a crucial feature of these scenarios that cannot be neglected."}

These particles, with energies exceeding 10$^{20}$~eV, provide insights into extreme astrophysical processes but remain challenging to detect due to their low flux. At the heart of JEM-EUSO's technology is an ultra-fast, highly sensitive UV camera capable of detecting EASs in the atmosphere with exceptional spatial and temporal resolution. A dedicated Cherenkov camera has been developed to evaluate the viability of the Earth-skimming technique from high altitudes. Fluorescence and Cherenkov detectors can be used together to create a hybrid detection surface. This innovative approach enables detailed studies of fluorescence and Cherenkov light from cosmic ray and neutrino interactions. The JEM-EUSO technology will allow for observations from space to significantly increase the exposure to these rare phenomena. The collaboration employs a multi-platform strategy with ground-based experiments like EUSO-TA calibrating detection systems and validating models, and balloon-borne missions such as EUSO-Balloon and EUSO-SPB1/SPB2 demonstrating observations from the stratosphere and testing technologies. Space-based missions, particularly Mini-EUSO on the ISS, have provided valuable data on UV backgrounds, TLEs, and meteoroids, as well as demonstrating the potential for future space-based detection. While we are developing a cross-platform methodology, we are ultimately moving towards space-based measurements.

In this work, we provide a class of simplified collider templates for these particles that encompasses a broader range of masses, sound speeds, and interactions. We propose that, given the current state of observations, the most effective strategy to search for PNG signals is through orthogonalizing the collider templates, such that they are uncorrelated with the tightly constrained single field predictions. Using the Modal pipeline and Planck CMB data, we perform a systematic parameter scan of the collider templates with the most significant result reaching $2.4σ$ for spin-0, after taking into account the look-elsewhere effect; indicative results for spin-1 and spin-2 peak near 2$σ$. These results indicate that, with refined collider templates and improved data analysis strategies, there are credible prospects with forthcoming observations to detect PNG and also rule out single field inflation."}

The default strategy is to reduce data after each daily observation and stack the resulting images. Although this approach is computationally efficient, it risks propagating systematic errors and significantly degrades the final data quality. However, storage and computation requirements for a traditional way to image the entire deep dataset together are prohibitively expensive. We present an alternative \\textit{uv}-grid stacking method and compare its scientific outcomes with both the traditional approach, which processes all data jointly and serves as the best-possible result, and the default image-stacking method. Our technique involves halting the standard imaging pipeline after the daily residual visibility grids are formed. These grids are then stacked and jointly deconvolved to combine many epochs of data. Using the traditional approach as a benchmark, we show that image-stacking recovers only 92\\% of the true {\\HI} flux. In contrast, our \\textit{uv}-grid stacking method recovers 99\\%, which is in excellent agreement with the traditional method within the noise limits. Furthermore, image-stacking introduces significant non-physical artefacts, such as negative bowls around strong sources, indicating poor deconvolution and a loss of physical information. Based on these findings, we intend to apply the \\textit{uv}-grid stacking to the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) survey on ASKAP and strongly recommend this or a similar approach for future radio astronomy facilities."}

In this domain, galaxy emission consists of thermal dust, free-free and synchrotron emissions with a possible additional contribution from anomalous microwave emission (AME) peaking near 1 cm.The aim of this study is to accurately characterize the integrated spectral energy distribution (SED) of galaxies in the mm-cm range. We used COBE-DIRBE, IRAS, Planck, and WMAP all-sky surveys, brought to the same resolution of $1^\\circ$, to cover 18 photometric bands from 97$μ$m to 1.3 cm. Given the low angular resolution and mixing with foreground and background emission that hampers the detection of the galaxy, our sample consists of 6 of the brightest, nearby galaxies: LMC, SMC, M31, M33, NGC 253 and NGC 4945. We subtract Milky Way dust emission, distant unresolved galaxies, and foreground point sources in the fields. We fit each integrated SED with a model of thermal dust, free-free, synchrotron, AME and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature fluctuations. The integrated SEDs of our sample of galaxies are well fitted by the model within the uncertainties, although degeneracies between the different components contributing to the mm-cm emission complicate the estimation of their individual contributions. We do not clearly detect AME in any of our target galaxies, and AME emissivity upper limits are weak compared to Galactic standards, suggesting that the signal of AME might be diluted at the scale of a whole galaxy. We infer positive CMB fluctuations in the background of 5 out of our 6 galaxies. This effect might be related to the degeneracy between the dust emissivity index and CMB fluctuations in the background, or linked to the specific spatial distribution of CMB fluctuations coupled with the low resolution and small number statistics."}

It has been found that fundamental superstrings can grow in a kinating background driven by the rolling of the volume modulus of Type IIB string compactifications towards the minimum of its potential. In this talk, I will generalise this analysis using dynamical systems techniques. First, I will analyse the cosmological growth of strings with a field-dependent tension in a Universe filled with a perfect fluid, finding a growth region in the phase space of this system. This machinery is then applied to both fundamental superstrings and effective strings obtained from wrapping $p$-branes on $(p-1)$- dimensional cycles. I will show how cosmological growth can be achieved in both cases not only in kinating backgrounds, but also in scaling fixed points. This talk is based on arXiv:2502.14953."}

The de-facto standard algorithm, the Cotton-Schwab CLEAN, is iteratively switching between computing a deconvolution (minor loop) and subtracting the model from the visibilities (major loop). The next generation of radio interferometers is expected to deal with much higher data rates, image sizes and sensitivity, making an acceleration of current data processing algorithms necessary. We aim to achieve this by evaluating the potential of various well-known acceleration techniques in convex optimization to the major loop. For the present manuscript, we limit the scope to study these techniques only in the CLEAN framework. To this end, we identify CLEAN with a Newton scheme, and use this chain of arguments backwards to express Nesterov acceleration and conjugate gradient orthogonalization in the major and minor loop framework. The resulting algorithms are simple extensions of the traditional framework, but converge multiple times faster than traditional techniques, and reduce the residual significantly deeper. These improvements achieved by accelerating the major loop are competitive to well-known improvements by replacing the minor loop with more advanced algorithms, but at lower numerical cost. The best performance is achieved by combining these two developments.CLEAN remains among the fastest and most robust algorithms for imaging in radio interferometry, and can be easily extended to an almost an order of magnitude faster convergence speed and dynamic range. The procedure outlined in this manuscript is relatively straightforward and could be easily extended."}

However, the estimation of the baryon mass depends critically on several assumptions regarding the gas density profile, temperature, metallicity, and the underlying halo mass distribution. Here, we assess how these assumptions affect the inferred baryon mass of the X-ray-emitting CGM in MW-mass galaxies, based on the stacked eROSITA signal. We find that variations in temperature profiles and uncertainties in the halo mass introduce the dominant sources of uncertainty, resulting in X-ray-emitting baryon mass estimates that vary by nearly a factor of four ($0.8-3.5\\times10^{11} M_\\odot$). Assumptions about metallicity contribute an additional uncertainty of approximately $50\\%$. We emphasize that accurate X-ray spectral constraints on gas temperature and metallicity, along with careful modeling of halo mass uncertainty, are essential for accurately estimating the baryon mass for MW-mass galaxies. Future X-ray microcalorimeter missions will be crucial for determining the hot CGM properties and closing the baryon census at the MW-mass scale."}

This jitter may be intrinsic as the broad-line emitting region (BLR) reverberates from the AGN continuum. There are also coordinated variations in the width of the broad emission lines and the luminosity of the central source ('breathing' or 'anti-breathing') which remain unexplained. These can be used as a tool for testing models of the BLR. We have constructed a pipeline to simulate a disk-like BLR geometry that reverberates in response to various chosen continuum light curves and produce synthetic emission line profiles. These profiles can then be characterized by measured shape parameters (centroid velocity shift, velocity dispersion, and Pearson skewness coefficient) and compared to observed time series of those same parameters. We have found that through our pipeline, we can recreate the velocity jitter at similar variations found in observations. The computational tools presented in this paper will also be applicable to case studies of quasars observed under the Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V) Black Hole Mapper reverberation mapping program.

Although the coupling is too feeble to thermalize the ALP, coherent forward scattering between the two sectors induces temperature-dependent mass shifts that substantially modify both WIMP freeze-out and ALP misalignment dynamics, giving rise to a novel coherent freeze-out mechanism. At high temperatures, the WIMP thermal bath spontaneously breaks the symmetry of the ALP potential, displacing the field to a new vacuum. The resulting back-reaction reduces the WIMP effective mass and delays its freeze-out. Depending on the strength of the coupling, symmetry restoration occurs via either a first-order phase transition (FOPT) or a crossover. In the FOPT regime, dark matter consists solely of WIMPs, whose delayed freeze-out permits annihilation cross sections up to two (five) orders of magnitude above the standard value for $s$-wave ($p$-wave) annihilation, while still yielding the correct relic density. In the crossover regime, both WIMP and ALP can contribute to dark matter. Remarkably, we find an \"ALP miracle\": a Planck-suppressed quadratic coupling yields an ALP abundance comparable to the observed dark matter density, largely independent of its initial displacement and mass."}

The goal of our method is to maximize the exploitation of available archival interferometric data. By stacking visibilities of galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts directly in the Fourier domain and transforming them into the rest-frame, we can enhance the stacked signal, suppress noise, and improve image reconstruction thanks to an extended coverage of the visibility domain. The ViSta method is highly flexible, allowing stacking of visibilities regardless of the array configuration or spectral setup. It is effective for both targeted sources and spurious detections offset from the phase center, whether unresolved or extended, within the field of view of the telescope. We validated the method using simulated interferometric datasets. For point-like sources, we can reconstruct the true emission with approximately 90% accuracy, obtaining similar results to classical image-plane stacking. In contrast, for faint and extended sources below the noise level, our method can provide a more accurate estimate of the signal compared to traditional image-based approaches. Finally, we applied ViSta to a sample of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) to detect the CO(3-2) emission line. As for the simulated case, we demonstrated that our tool performs better than image-plane stacking when the signal from individual sources is no longer easily detectable, achieving higher SNR. Finally, we outline potential future applications of this stacking approach."}

Analyses of synthetic X-ray pulse waveform data similar to the data obtained from non-accreting neutron stars using the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) have indicated that mass and radius estimates made using such data are robust against some systematic errors that may be made when modeling these data, such as errors in the assumed pattern of the thermal X-ray emission from the surface of these stars. A potentially important but so far unexplored source of systematic error is misparameterization of unmodulated background components, which can bias the inferred radius, particularly when data from different telescopes are used in the analysis. In this study, we investigate the effects of the background model on radius estimates by jointly analyzing synthetic NICER and XMM-Newton data, using the $\\sim 2.1~M_\\odot$ pulsar PSR~J0740$+$6620 as a prototypical example. Our analysis shows that even if the background assumed in the model underestimates the actual background by a factor of more than five, the resulting shift of the radius posterior from the true value of the radius corresponds to only $\\sim1σ$. In all the cases we examined, the Bayesian evidence for the correct background model is greater than for the incorrect background model. These results add to the evidence that analyses of NICER-like data provide accurate measurements of neutron star radii when the statistical sampling is thorough and the model fits the data well."}

It is highly plausible though, should they exist, that they would not make up all of the DM. Several studies showed that if the rest of DM is made of thermal particles, then these should accumulate around such PBHs, leading to the formation of very dense spikes in the radiation era. We contributed a detailed analytical study about this phenomenon, providing clear explanations as for the origin of scaling relations in the form of power-law density profiles with up to 3 different spectral indices, i.e. $3/4$, $3/2$, and $9/4$, and 4 asymptotic regimes. Here, we further derive an approximate analytical solution that enables fast numerical predictions for the density profiles of these spikes. We also address the specific case of self-annihilating DM species and derive new approximate analytical formulae. Our approximate density yields the correct annihilation rate within $\\pm 15\\%$ precision. We then focus on indirect detection in the cosmic microwave background and in extragalactic gamma-rays.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "The intrinsic properties of galaxies are influenced by their environments, underscoring the environment's critical role in galaxy formation and evolution. Traditionally, these environments are categorized into four fixed classifications: knots, filaments, walls, and voids, which collectively describe the complex organization of galaxies within large-scale structures. We propose an alternative description that complements the traditional quadripartite categorization by introducing a continuous framework, allowing for a more nuanced examination of the relationship between the intrinsic properties of galaxies and their environments. This complementary description is applied using one of the most prevalent methodologies: categorization using the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix extracted from the matter density field. We integrated our findings into a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, combined with cosmological numerical simulations, to analyze how the intrinsic properties of galaxies are influenced by environmental changes. In our study, we find a continuous distribution of eigenvalue ratios, revealing a clear dependence of galaxy properties on their surrounding environments. This method allowed us to identify critical values at which transitions in the behavior of key astrophysical galaxy properties become evident."}

Building on this framework, we present a numerical implementation to study the evolution of primordial scalar perturbations under controlled state deformations induced by the simplest environment corrections from the Lindblad equation. Our approach generalizes to an arbitrary number of degrees of freedom and does not rely on the slow-roll approximation. The computational routine is numerically efficient and allows users to configure arbitrary sequences of decoherence events, with full control over their duration, shape, amplitude and effective wavelength range. The resulting outputs are compatible with nonlinear numerical codes, enabling studies of how decoherence effects propagate during reheating."}

When dark matter substructure possesses sufficient perturbations, it may lead to the formation of extra images in otherwise canonical doubly or quadruply imaged systems. With the advent of increasingly precise observational instruments, previously undetectable images may become measurable and image number anomalies therefore could be an increasingly viable method. In this paper, we utilize the gravitational lensing phenomenon of image number anomaly to derive constraints on dark matter substructure. We present the extra images induced by distinct forms of DM substructure, specifically primordial black holes (PBHs) and fuzzy dark matter (FDM) and show that higher angular resolution observations increase the probability of detecting additional lensed images. Based on a null detection of image number anomalies in a sample of 3500 lens systems generated from the \\textit{Strong Lensing Halo model-based mock catalogs} (SL-Hammocks), we derive upper limits on the abundance of PBHs. At the 95\\% confidence level, the PBH abundance is constrained to $\\lesssim 0.125\\%$, $0.08\\%$, and $0.04\\%$ for PBH masses in the range $\\sim 10^{7}$--$10^{9}~M_{\\odot}$, corresponding to angular resolutions of $0.1''$, $0.05''$, and $0.01''$, respectively. Similarly, we exclude particle masses below $0.4$, $0.6$, and $3.5 \\times 10^{-22} \\ \\mathrm{eV}$ for FDM at the same confidence level for the respective resolutions. Furthermore, the abundance of PBHs $\\lesssim 0.9\\%$ could be constrained at an angular resolution of $0.5''$ for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Observations. Finally, we discuss methodologies for identifying image number anomalies in special cases and demonstrate feasibility using a fitting procedure."}

The enlarged parameter space makes inference computationally costly, which has so far limited systematic, large-scale studies that are essential to quantify degeneracies, check effect of waveform systematics, and assess robustness across non-stationary and non-Gaussian noise effects. The need is even sharper for next-generation (XG) observatories where signals are longer, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) are higher, and likelihood evaluations increase substantially. We address this by applying relative binning to the TIGER framework for parameterized tests of GR. Relative binning replaces dense frequency evaluations with evaluations on adaptively chosen frequency bins, reducing the cost per likelihood call while preserving posterior accuracy. Using simulated binary black hole signals, we demonstrate unbiased recovery for GR-consistent cases and targeted non-GR deviations, and we map how bin resolution controls accuracy, with fine binning primarily required for the $-1$ post-Newtonian term. A high-SNR simulated signal at next-generation sensitivity further shows accurate recovery with tight posteriors. Applied to GW150914 and GW250114, both single and multi-parameter TIGER analyses finish within a day, yielding deviation bounds consistent with GR at 90\\% credibility and in agreement with previous results. Across analyses, the method reduces wall time by factors of $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(100)$, depending on frequency range and binning, without degrading parameter estimation accuracy."}

Ions were classified as thermal, suprathermal, or nonthermal, depending on the energy they achieved and the acceleration regime they fell under. These classifications were used to train deep learning models to predict which particles are injected into the acceleration process with high accuracy (>90%), using only time series of the local magnetic field they experienced during their initial interaction with the shock. An autoencoder architecture was also tested, for which time series of various parameters were reconstructed from encoded representations. This study shows the potential of applying machine learning techniques to extract physical insights from kinetic plasma simulations and sets the groundwork for future applications, including the construction of sub-grid models in fluid approaches."}

We update the previous photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) of the KiDS quasars using Hybrid-z, a deep learning framework combining four-band KiDS images and nine-band KiDS+VIKING magnitudes. Hybrid-z is trained on the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR1 and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR17 quasars matching with KiDS, and achieves average bias $\\langle δz \\rangle < 0.01$ and scatter $\\sim 0.04(1 + z)$ on a test sample.

In each bin, we measure the angular two-point correlation function and compare it with theoretical predictions for dark matter clustering. We estimate the best-fit scale-independent quasar bias, which increases from $b \\approx 1.6$ at $z \\approx 0.6$ to $b \\approx 4.0$ at $z \\approx 2.2$, and is well matched by a quadratic relation in redshift.

We study two systematics that could affect the bias derivation: stellar contamination and the redshift distribution assumed in the theoretical modeling. The former has a negligible effect, whereas the latter significantly impacts the derived $b(z)$, emphasizing the importance of redshift calibration. Our work is the first cosmological application of quasars selected from KiDS and paves the way for future extensions in the final KiDS DR5, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, or the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope."}

The current bias leans towards a galaxy population found in the field or towards rich star-bursty proto-cluster groups, both tendentiously surveyed at coarse spatial resolutions. Here, we describe a deep 3mm ALMA survey in long-baselines on a 1x1arcmin2 region in the Hubble Deep Field South, also covered by the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) in order to assess resolved molecular gas properties in galaxies in group environments at z>1. ALMA observations comprising a 4-pointing mosaic with a single Band3 (3mm) spectral tuning were conducted to cover CO transitions from different groups identified by MUSE. This work consists in a total effective time on source of 61h in configurations with up to 15km baselines. The final data-set yields an angular resolution of 0.15\"-0.2\" (imaging weights dependent) and maximum recoverable scales of 1\"-2\". The final continuum map reaches a sensitivity of rms~2uJy/beam, allowing the detection of three sources at 3mm (only one showing multi-wavelength counterparts). Moreover, we detect six line emitters associated with CO J=2-1 at zspec=1.284, one of them previously undetected by MUSE and none detected in 3mm continuum. The inter-stellar medium gas masses range from ~2E9 to ~9E10 Msun (adopting alphaCO=4Msun/(K.km/s.pc2), including Helium). Overall, this galaxy group is quite diverse with no two galaxies alike, some showing clear physical offsets with respect to Hubble imaging tracing rest-frame ultra-violet emission. We also derive cosmic molecular gas mass densities using this sample as a reference for group environments, and we find that these yield comparable densities as the galaxy population found in field environments."}

X-ray catalogues with hundreds of thousands of detections are treasure troves of such sources, which require innovative methods to identify these black holes.

We also describe the STONKS pipeline that is now in the XMM-Newton automatic reduction pipeline and the near real-time alert system that allows the follow-up of new and fading transients. We provide examples of fading sources that are newly identified candidate TDEs."}

Among the important consequences for precision cosmology is the potential impact on the linear growth of large-scale structures. We address this impact by combining covariant spatial averaging with covariant and gauge-invariant perturbation theory. We focus on irrotational dust model spacetimes. The effects of backreaction and nontrivial dynamical curvature on the average cosmological dynamics are formulated as the addition of an effective perfect fluid with pressure. We then introduce an effective background driven by both the averaged dust density and the emergent effective fluid, and derive the general evolution equations for linear perturbations of this system. The residual freedom in this framework amounts to specifying the properties of the effective-fluid perturbations as a closure condition. We analyse two physically motivated choices for this condition. In addition, we clarify the conditions under which the coupling between linear structure growth and perturbations of the effective fluid can be neglected. Finally, we apply this formalism to four examples of averaged cosmological models from the literature, three of which -- intended as effective full descriptions of the largest scales -- have been shown to provide a good fit to observational data. Our results highlight the importance of backreaction effects in shaping linear structure growth in such models. Neglecting these effects may thus lead to biased predictions for the development of large structures, even when the models provide a good description of the general background observables."}

The default strategy is to reduce data after each daily observation and stack the resulting images. Although this approach is computationally efficient, it risks propagating systematic errors and significantly degrades the final data quality. However, storage and computation requirements for a traditional way to image the entire deep dataset together are prohibitively expensive. We present an alternative \\textit{uv}-grid stacking method and compare its scientific outcomes with both the traditional approach, which processes all data jointly and serves as the best-possible result, and the default image-stacking method. Our technique involves halting the standard imaging pipeline after the daily residual visibility grids are formed. These grids are then stacked and jointly deconvolved to combine many epochs of data. Using the traditional approach as a benchmark, we show that image-stacking recovers only 92\\% of the true {\\HI} flux. In contrast, our \\textit{uv}-grid stacking method recovers 99\\%, which is in excellent agreement with the traditional method within the noise limits. Furthermore, image-stacking introduces significant non-physical artefacts, such as negative bowls around strong sources, indicating poor deconvolution and a loss of physical information. Based on these findings, we intend to apply the \\textit{uv}-grid stacking to the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) survey on ASKAP and strongly recommend this or a similar approach for future radio astronomy facilities."}
