However, even in scenarios\nwhere DR is 'secluded', i.e., only gravitationally interacting with SM and DM,\nit can leave discernible signatures. We present a comprehensive study of four\ndifferent types of DR: free-streaming, self-interacting (coupled), decoupling,\nand recoupling DR, and vary initial conditions to include both adiabatic and\nisocurvature perturbations. In addition to these properties, we also vary\nneutrino energy density, DR energy density, and the SM neutrino masses to\nperform a general analysis and study degeneracies among neutrino and DR\nproperties. We derive constraints using the cosmic microwave background,\nlarge-scale structure, and supernova datasets. We find no significant\npreference for physics beyond the $\\Lambda$CDM model, but data exhibit\ninteresting interplays between different physical quantities. When the neutrino\nenergy density is allowed to vary, we find that the cosmological dataset\nprefers massless free-streaming DR over massive neutrinos, leading to a\nsignificant relaxation of the neutrino mass bound. Although we do not find any\nevidence of DR isocurvature, the data show support for a strong blue tilt of\nthe isocurvature power spectrum.

Especially below 100 MHz,\nphase unwrapping difficulties and higher-order dispersion effects can\ncomplicate the separation of ionospheric and clock delays. Aims: We address\nthis challenge by introducing a method for reliably separating clock delays\nfrom ionospheric effects, even under mediocre to poor ionospheric conditions\nencountered near solar maximum. Methods: The approach employs a key technique:\nwe modelled our likelihood space using the circular Gaussian distribution (von\nMises random variable) rather than non-circular distributions that suffer from\n$2\\pi$ phase ambiguities. This ensures that noisier data are weighted less\nheavily than cleaner data during the fitting process. Results: The method\nreliably separates clock delays and ionospheric terms that vary smoothly in\ntime whilst providing a good fit to the data. A comparison with the\nclock-ionosphere separation approach used in standard LOFAR data processing\nshows that our technique achieves significant improvements. In contrast to the\nold algorithm, which often fails to return reliable results below 100 MHz even\nunder good ionospheric conditions, the new algorithm consistently provides\nreliable solutions across a wider range of conditions.

Our analysis of the VLITE light curve\ndemonstrates that J0330-2730 has significant 340 MHz flux variability at the\n~20% level over a timescale of approximately one year. Our VLBA images reveal a\nresolved, double-lobed morphology with a projected linear size of 64 pc. We\nconsider plausible mechanisms that could explain the observed 340 MHz\nvariability and the source properties on milliarcsecond scales. We rule-out\nvariable Doppler boosting and conclude that refractive interstellar\nscintillation or variable free-free absorption are the most likely\nexplanations. We argue that the properties of J0330-2730 are consistent with\nthe class of compact symmetric objects (CSOs) and consider the evolutionary\nstage of the source. The extent of the resolved lobes revealed by the VLBA is\nsignificantly smaller than predictions based on the turnover-size relation for\na standard synchrotron self-absorbed jet model. We discuss possible\nexplanations for the departure from the turnover-size relation, including jet\nformation by a transient phenomenon such as a tidal disruption event or a\n\"frustrated jet\" impeded by the presence of dense gas or a high-pressure\nenvironment. This study highlights the potential of VLITE for the\nidentification of compact and young radio sources."}

Recent simulations have shown such planes to be common, but\nthey have been described as either \"transient\", short-lived alignments, or\n\"persistent\", long-lived structures. Here we analyse Milky Way analogue systems\nin the cosmological simulation TNG-50 to resolve this apparent contradiction.\nWe show that, as the satellite populations of individual hosts rapidly change,\nthe observed anisotropies of their satellite systems are invariably\nshort-lived, with lifetimes of no more than a few hundred million years.\nHowever, when the progenitors of the same satellites are traced backwards, we\nfind examples where those identified to form a plane at the present day have\nretained spatial coherence over several Gyr. The two ostensibly conflicting\npredictions for the lifetimes of satellite planes can be reconciled as two\nperspectives on the same phenomenon."}

The\nHabitable Worlds Observatory is one of two upcoming missions with the\npossibility of significant UV capabilities, and the only one early enough in\ndevelopment to consider suggestions to its design. In this paper, we conduct an\ninitial study of how current common UV filter sets affect the results of\nspectral energy distribution fitting for the estimation of galaxy parameter.\nThis initial look is intended to motivate the need for future, more robust, SED\nfitting of mock galaxies. We compare the broad near UV and far UV filters used\nby the GALEX mission to the three more narrow Swift UVOT filters. We find that\nthe GALEX filters result in larger errors when calculating the UV beta\nparameter compared to UVOT, and provide little constraint on the star formation\nage of a galaxy. We further note the ability of the UVOT filters to investigate\nthe 2175\\r{A} attenuation bump; GALEX has a reduced capacity to trace this same\nfeature. Ultimately, we recommend that in order to optimize the effectiveness\nof HWO's ultraviolet capacity for transformative astrophysics, a minimum of a\nFUV filter with three medium band NUV filters should be adopted. This will\ncombine the power of GALEX's wavelength range with the finer sampling of UVOT\naround an important dust feature."}

However, which stellar populations inhabit the inner Galaxy or\nhow star formation proceeded there is still unknown. The difficulty in studying\nthese stars stems from their location in dense regions that are strongly\nimpacted by extinction and crowding effects. In this work, we use star\nformation histories computed in the solar neighbourhood using Gaia\nColour-Magnitude Diagram fitting to shed light onto the evolution of the\ncentral regions of our Galaxy. For that, we have obtained precise age\ndistributions for the non-negligible amount of super metal-rich stars ([M/H]\n$\\sim$ 0.5) in the solar neighbourhood (more than 5$\\%$ of the total stars\nwithin 400 pc of the plane). Assuming that these stars were born in the inner\nGalaxy and migrated outwards, those distributions should be indicative of the\ntrue stellar age distribution in the inner Galaxy. Surprisingly, we find that\nthese age distributions are not continuous but show clear signs of episodic\nstar formation ($\\sim$~13.5, 10.0, 7.0, 4.0, 2.0 and less than 1~Gyr ago).\nInterestingly, with the exception of the 4~Gyr event, the timings of the\ndetected events coincide with the formation of the primitive Milky Way and with\nknown merging events or satellite encounters (Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage,\nSagittarius dwarf galaxy, and the Magellanic Clouds), suggesting that these\ncould have induced enhanced and global star-forming episodes. These results are\ncompatible with a scenario in which Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage is responsible for\nthe formation of the bar 10 Gyr ago. However, we cannot associate any accretion\ncounterpart with the 4-Gyr-ago event, leaving room for a late formation of the\nbar, as previously proposed.

Adopting a Schechter distribution, f(z,W)dW = Phi* (W/W*)^alpha\ne^{-W/W*} dW/W*, we present the normalization, Phi*(z), the characteristic\nequivalent width, W*(z), and the weak-end slope, alpha(z), as smooth functions\nof redshift. Measurements of dN/dX are robust for z < 4 but less so at z > 4\nfor weaker absorbers (Wr < 0.3 [angstroms]). We bracketed two data-driven\nscenarios: from z ~ 7 to z ~ 4, dN/dX of weak absorbers is (1) constant, or (2)\ndecreasing. For scenario #1, the evolution of Phi*(z), W*(z), and alpha(z) show\nthat in the post-reionization universe, weak systems are nonevolving while the\nincidence of the strongest systems increases until Cosmic Noon; following\nCosmic Noon, the strongest absorbers slowly evolve away while the incidence of\nweak absorbers rapidly increases. For scenario #2, the parameter evolution is\nsuch that, in the post-reionization universe, weak systems evolve away while\nthe incidence of the strongest systems increases until Cosmic Noon; following\nCosmic Noon, the behavior tracks the same as scenario #1. We argue in favor of\nscenario #2 based on corroborating OI, CII, and SiII measurements at z > 4. Our\nresults provide a unified, quantitative description for MgII absorber evolution\nspanning 13 billion years of cosmic time and offer deeper insights into\ngalactic baryon cycle physics. They also highlight the need for deep z > 5 MgII\nsurveys and have implications for detectability of a MgII forest at z > 7."}

The bursts of radio activity in most cases are\nlikely due to intrinsic changes in the accretion processes. However, for a few\nsources in this sample, we cannot rule out the possibility that their radio\nvariability results from a tidal disruption event (TDE). In this work, we\nextend our analysis to the optical and infrared regimes, confirming that our\nsample of radio transients is not homogeneous in terms of their optical and\ninfrared properties either. The host galaxies of most of these sources are\nmassive ellipticals with emission dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN).\nThey host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses typical of radio-loud\nAGNs ($\\rm >10^7\\,M_{\\odot}$), but exhibit very low accretion activity. In\ncontrast, the sources for which a TDE origin is suspected are either pure\nstar-forming galaxies or show significant ongoing star formation, similar to\nradio-selected optically-detected TDEs. Additionally, two of them exhibit\ninfrared flares characteristic of TDEs, while the remaining sources do not\ndisplay significant variability outside the radio regime. Moreover, the\nevolution of their radio brightness in the W3/radio diagnostic diagram, which\nwe employ in our analysis, also sets our TDE candidates apart from the rest of\nthe sample and resembles the radio variability seen in optically discovered\nTDEs with radio emission. Finally, based on our findings, we hypothesize that\nthe mid-IR/radio relation can serve as a tool to distinguish between radio\ntransients caused by TDEs and those originating from intrinsic AGN variability."}

Interestingly,\nfour WFs (IRAS 15445$-$5449, IRAS 18019$-$2216, IRAS 18443$-$0231, and IRAS\n18464$-$0140) and one WF candidate (IRAS 18480+0008) are potential planetary\nnebulae (PNe) because they exhibit radio continuum emission, suggesting the\npresence of a photoionized region characteristic of PNe. To classify these\nobjects, we obtained K-band (2.0-2.3 $\\mu$m) spectra of these WFs, including\nthe only WF PN known (IRAS 15103$-$5754) for comparison. Our spectra reveal two\ngroup of sources: (i) `low-velocity' WFs with H$_2$O maser velocity spread of\n$\\lesssim$50 km s$^{-1}$ (IRAS 18019$-$2216, IRAS 18464$-$0140, and IRAS\n18480+0008) showing the CO band at 2.29 $\\mu$m in absorption, typical of cool\ngiant stars, and no emission lines; and (ii) `high-velocity' WFs, velocity\nspread of $\\gtrsim$50 km s$^{-1}$ (IRAS 15103$-$5754, IRAS 15445$-$5449, and\nIRAS 18443$-$0231), exhibiting emission lines of Br$\\gamma$, He I, and H$_2$,\nconsistent with hotter central stars and/or shock-excited emission. The\nemission line ratios of these lines in IRAS 18443$-$0231 indicates that it may\nbe a nascent PN. The spectrum of IRAS 15445$-$5449 also shows a CO band and Na\nI doublet in emission, suggesting the presence of a compact circumstellar disk\nand/or active mass loss. These results favor the previously suggested notion\nthat the difference between low- and high-velocity WFs is not simply a\nprojection effect but reflects intrinsically different evolutionary stages.\nMoreover, the results are also consistent with the idea of an increase in the\njet ejection velocity as the post-AGB evolution proceeds."}

These sources show periodic flux\ndensity variations across the electromagnetic spectrum, signaling the presence\nof a good clock. To explain the emission, we propose a generalizable jet model,\nwhere a mildly relativistic wind creates an outward-moving helical channel,\nalong which the ultra-relativistic jet propagates. The observed flux variation\nfrom the jet is mostly due to aberration. The emission at lower frequency\narises at larger radius and its variation is consequently delayed, as observed.\nOur model reproduces the main observable features of both sources and can be\napplied to other sources as they are discovered.
