Analytic\npotentials allow for fast calculations, but are idealized and non-responsive.\nOn the other hand, $N$-body simulations are more realistic, but demand higher\ncomputational cost. Our goal is to characterize the regimes in which analytic\npotentials provide a sufficient approximation, and those where $N$-bodies are\nnecessary. We perform two sets of simulations using both Gala and Gadget, in\norder to closely compare the orbital evolution of satellites around a Milky\nWay-like galaxy. Focusing on the periods when the satellite has not yet been\nseverely disrupted by tidal forces, we find that the orbits of satellites up to\n$10^{8} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ can be reliably computed with analytic potentials to\nwithin 5% error, if they are circular or moderately eccentric. If the satellite\nis as massive as $10^{9} {\\rm M_{\\odot}}$, errors of 9% are to be expected.\nHowever, if the orbital radius is smaller than 30 kpc, the results may not be\nrelied upon with the same accuracy beyond 1--2 Gyr."}

Recently, renewed interest in the dSph Leo I has\nresulted from claims suggesting the presence of a central supermassive black\nhole (BH), with mass estimates that challenge the typical expectations for\ndSphs, which are generally thought to host intermediate-mass black holes\n(IMBHs). However, Pascale et al. 2024 presented new upper limits on the BH\nmass, which are consistent with the range for IMBHs, solving the concerns\nraised in previous studies. Building on the analysis of Pascale et al. 2024, we\nexamine the DM properties of Leo I inferred from the dynamical models of that\npaper. Our results indicate that Leo I is the galaxy with the highest DM\ndensity among the classical dSphs, with a central DM density (measured at a\ndistance of $150$ pc from the galaxy centre)\n$\\rho_{150}=35.5_{-4.7}^{+3.8}\\times10^7\\,M_\\odot\\,$pc$^{-3}$. The DM density\nprofile has logarithmic slope $\\gamma_{150}=-0.89_{-0.17}^{+0.21}$ at $150$ pc,\nin line with literature values. At smaller distances the DM distribution\nflattens into a core, with a core radius of $r_c=72^{+40}_{-32}$ pc. Combined\nwith the small pericentric distance of Leo I's orbit in the Milky Way, the new\nestimate of $\\rho_{150}$ makes Leo I decisive in the study of the\nanticorrelation between pericentre and central DM density, and suggests that\nthe anticorrelation could be significantly steeper and more pronounced than\npreviously estimated.

This review focuses specifically on how dust grains\ninfluence interstellar chemical abundances and on the processes that regulate\nthe evolution of the galactic dust budget. I describe the main physical\nprocesses regulating dust evolution, including production by stars and other\nsources, destruction in supernova shocks and interstellar growth and how they\nare included in galactic chemical evolution models. I discuss the main effects\nof interstellar dust on the abundances measured in various high-redshift\nsystems that include Damped Lyman alpha absorbers detected along the lines of\nsight of distant quasars and in the absorption spectra of Gamma Ray Burst\nafterglows. I discuss the measure of the dust mass in galaxies and review its\nglobal budget, evaluated through the study of the evolution of the comoving\ndust mass density, for which I present an up-to-date compilation of data chosen\nfrom the literature. Interstellar dust growth plays a critical role in\nregulating the dust budget, for which I present a list of evidence both in\nfavour of it and against. The dust budget at high redshift is one aspect that\nrequires attention to drive significant progress in the future, along with the\ninvestigation of the properties of dust in local, low-metallicity systems.

Clumps,\nthe main small substructures in the rest-frame NIR, are the most common type\nand are much fainter (2% of the flux) than similar UV clumps in the literature.\nNearly all galaxies at the high-mass end of the main sequence (MS), starburst,\nand green valley regions have substructures. However, we do not find\nsubstructures in low-mass galaxies in the green valley and red sequence.\nAlthough massive galaxies on the MS and in the green valley have a 40%\nprobability of hosting multiple clumps, the majority of clumpy galaxies host\nonly a single clump.\n  The fraction of clumpy galaxies in the rest-frame NIR is determined by the\nstellar mass and SFR of the host galaxies. Its evolution with redshift is due\nto galaxies moving towards lower SFRs at z < 2 and the build-up of low-mass\ngalaxies in the green valley and red sequence.

Some\nmorphological features are clearly associated with one or the other interaction\n(e.g. tidal bridges vs long one-sided linear gas tails). But, under certain\ncircumstances, both mechanisms can result in morphological features that could\nbe confused, such as lopsided or asymmetric disks and unwinding spiral arms.\n  Aims: Our aim is to develop new measures for application to asymmetric\ngalaxies of this type that distinguish gravitational-only tidal interactions\nfrom ram pressure stripping, and that can be applied directly to simulations,\nand potentially to observations.\n  Methods: We define a new measure for galaxies called the Size-Shape\nDifference (SSD) measure. This measure is sensitive to differences in the size\nand shape of a younger stellar population (<200 Myr) compared to that of an\nintermediate age stellar population (200-400 Myr). We use numerical simulations\nof galaxies undergoing gravitational-only tidal interactions and/or undergoing\nram pressure stripping to test the measure.\n  Results: Because ram pressure tends to directly alter the gas distribution,\nthe younger stellar population (which best traces out the gas distribution)\ntends to change shape and morphology with respect to the intermediate age\npopulation. The SSD measure is sensitive to this change, and we find it can\neffectively distinguish between ram pressure and gravitational-only tidal\nencounters. In fact, we find it is even more effective when a combination of a\ntidal interaction and ram pressure has occurred together, as may arise in dense\nenvironments. As tidal interactions tend to enhance the spiral structure in\ndisk galaxies, the effectiveness of the SSD measure is further enhanced when\ncombined with a measure of the strength of the spiral arms."}

We aim to inform the interpretation of this resolved CO emission\nby creating synthetic observations and testing to what extent routinely\nobserved CO transitions can be used to trace H$_2$ across galaxy disks. To this\nend, we extract $z=1-3$ massive star-forming galaxies (on and above the main\nsequence) from the SIMBA cosmological simulation and predict their spatially\nresolved CO(1$-$0)-to-CO(5$-$4) emission using the $\\texttt{SLICK}$ pipeline,\nwhich combines sub-resolution modeling of the cloud population with the\nDESPOTIC spectral line calculation code.

Thus, the use of a single\n$\\alpha_{\\rm CO}$ to derive the H$_2$ surface density leads to severe\nunderestimates of the H$_2$ contribution in its outskirts. As expected,\nhigher-$J$ CO transitions trace molecular gas in the centers at higher\ndensities, whereas CO(1$-$0) better traces the more diffuse, extended molecular\ngas. We see significant variations in the CO excitation, with\nCO(3$-$2)/CO(1$-$0) line luminosity ratios of the most massive galaxies at\n$z\\sim2$ declining from $\\sim$ 0.9 in the galaxy centers to $\\sim$ 0.1 in the\noutskirts. On average, line ratios increase substantially toward higher\nredshifts and lower galaxy stellar masses.

EUCL\nJ181530.01+652054.0 is a high-excitation, broad absorption line quasar detected\nat 144 MHz by the LOw-Frequency Array (L144=4e25 W/Hz). The quasar has a\nbolometric luminosity of 3e12 Lsun and is powered by a 3.4e9 Msun black hole.\nThe discovery of this bright quasar is noteworthy as fewer than one such object\nwas expected in the ~20 deg2 surveyed.

The binary cluster candidate is analyzed by employing a set of\nwell established machine learning algorithms applied to the Gaia-EDR3 data.\nMembership probabilities and open clusters (OCs) parameters are determined by\nusing the clustering algorithms pyUPMASK, ASteCA, Kmeans, GMM, and HDBSCAN. In\naddition, a KNN smoothing algorithm is implemented to enhances the\nvisualization of features like overdensities in the 5D space and intrinsic\nstellar sequences on the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). The method validates\nthe clusters' parameters previously derived, however, suggests that their\nprobable members-stars are distributed over a wider overlapping area.

In short, these results confirm\nNGC1605a and NGC1605b as genuine OCs and reinforce the previous suggestion that\nthey form an old binary cluster in an advanced stage of merging after a tidal\ncapture during a close encounter.
