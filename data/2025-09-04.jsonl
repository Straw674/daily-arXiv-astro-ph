Their spatial density\n($\\sim10^{-4}$-$10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$) is 100 times more abundant than\nUV-selected quasars at those redshift if one extrapolates the quasar luminosity\nfunction (QLF) down to the LRD regime. However, whether LRDs dominate black\nhole accretion at quasar-like luminosities ($L_\\mathrm{bol}\\gtrsim\n10^{45-46}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$) remains unanswered, as probing the bright\nend of the LRD luminosity function requires a much larger area than those able\nto be surveyed by JWST. In this work, we present our search for the brightest\nLRDs ($K<23.7$) at $4.5<z<4.9$ using wide-area multiwavelength imaging surveys\nfrom the near-UV to the infrared bands. With over 15 square degrees of sky\ncoverage, we only identify one single LRD candidate at\n$z_\\mathrm{phot}\\approx4.6$, which translates into a spatial density of\n$n(M_{5100}<-23.5)\\approx10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ -- this is nearly 10\ntimes less abundant than the UV-selected quasars at similar optical luminosity.\nWhen combined with the LRD sample identified by JWST at the same redshift\nrange, we find a sharp cutoff in the optical luminosity function at $\\lambda\nL_{5100}\\approx2.5\\times10^{44}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$, while the QLF turnover\noccurs at $\\gtrsim20$ times higher luminosity. We therefore confirm the\nexclusively low-luminosity nature of LRDs, ruling out that LRDs are the counter\nparts of quasars. Furthermore, we speculate that, if the shape of the\nluminosity function holds up, it points to LRDs being powered by low-mass black\nholes with a narrow range of Eddington-level accretion rates."}

Using MIST stellar evolution tracks, we show that\nlow-velocity (< 20 km/s) AGB winds, each released over 10^4 yr, are\ngravitationally retained in >10^5 MSun clusters. In addition, AGB winds in such\nclusters collide with each other and the previously retained winds, triggering\na rapid `switch' to efficient gas retention. Expected gas retention fractions,\nmapped across cluster initial mass and size, agree well with the observed\nsecond population fractions in Milky Way GCs. We then show that the accumulated\ngas cannot form new stars because protostellar cores are disrupted by\nencounters with pre-existing stars over 1 - 10 kyr. Instead, the gas is\naccreted onto pre-existing main-sequence stars and compact objects. Bondi-Hoyle\naccretion and time-dependent core-halo models indicate that both white dwarfs\nand neutron stars can grow and collapse within a few 100 Myr, and that\nlower-mass main-sequence stars can be `rejuvenated' into the 4 - 6 MSun range\nrequired to reproduce key abundance patterns. Therefore, in our model, the\nmultiple populations will be found in sufficiently massive clusters, with the\nsecond-population stars being formed from the inner subset of first-population\nstars that accreted large fractions of their mass from the AGB-processed\nretained gas.

Works inferring the star formation\nhistories of at least one such galaxy observed with JWST have suggested that\nthe assembly of so much stellar mass so early may challenge the\nwell-established Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmological framework, or else\nindicate extraordinarily high past star formation efficiencies. However, these\nstudies implicitly assume that all the stars in place at the epoch of\nobservation assembled in-situ, i.e. in a single galaxy. In hierarchical models\nlike CDM, massive galaxies assemble following successive mergers of smaller\ngalaxies. Thus, inferences of the growth of stellar mass using the ages of\nstars within a descendant massive galaxy will be biased.

We conclude that H_0 errors may be\nincreased by up to a factor of 2 in comparison with neglecting peculiar\nvelocity covariance, with the highest impacts expected for sources at nearby\ndistances or with small distance errors. Our analytical methods may also be\napplied to other local distance indicators, such as Type Ia supernovae."}

The\nmechanism relies on the torques exerted by stellar spirals in late-type\ngalaxies that are present and active at $z>1.5$ as revealed by JWST/NIRCam. The\nprocess is at once secular, because the transformative structural changes\n(heating, compaction, bulge formation) occur over many ($\\approx10-30$) orbital\nperiods, but accelerated, because orbital times were significantly shorter than\nat the present day. In a first application, we take galaxy effective radius as\na proxy for galaxy structure and, using new measurements of the abundance and\nproperties of stellar spirals observed in a collection of JWST deep fields,\nshow that EASE predicts a distribution of early-type sizes that is smaller than\nlate-type galaxies and consistent with what is observed. The success of EASE\nrelies on an updated picture of the influence of spiral arms, in which\ntransience plays a key role. We present a new calculation of the characteristic\nwave equation in the fluid approximation that applies to steady and non-steady\nopen spirals beyond the more traditional tight-winding limit. This shows open,\ntransient spirals above the Jeans length growing and decaying on the order of a\ndynamical time in a wider region around and inside corotation than canonical\nsteady spirals. We show that this transient activity spreads out angular\nmomentum gains and losses, and the associated dynamical heating, giving spirals\na more extended influence than a single steady spiral. The ubiquity of spirals\nin star-forming galaxies with $M_*>10^{10.5}M_{\\odot}$ across the redshifts\nwhere early-type galaxies appear in large numbers suggests that EASE can play\nan important role in the morphological transformation of galaxies."}

Their spatial density\n($\\sim10^{-4}$-$10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$) is 100 times more abundant than\nUV-selected quasars at those redshift if one extrapolates the quasar luminosity\nfunction (QLF) down to the LRD regime. However, whether LRDs dominate black\nhole accretion at quasar-like luminosities ($L_\\mathrm{bol}\\gtrsim\n10^{45-46}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$) remains unanswered, as probing the bright\nend of the LRD luminosity function requires a much larger area than those able\nto be surveyed by JWST. In this work, we present our search for the brightest\nLRDs ($K<23.7$) at $4.5<z<4.9$ using wide-area multiwavelength imaging surveys\nfrom the near-UV to the infrared bands. With over 15 square degrees of sky\ncoverage, we only identify one single LRD candidate at\n$z_\\mathrm{phot}\\approx4.6$, which translates into a spatial density of\n$n(M_{5100}<-23.5)\\approx10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cMpc^{-3}}$ -- this is nearly 10\ntimes less abundant than the UV-selected quasars at similar optical luminosity.\nWhen combined with the LRD sample identified by JWST at the same redshift\nrange, we find a sharp cutoff in the optical luminosity function at $\\lambda\nL_{5100}\\approx2.5\\times10^{44}\\,\\mathrm{erg\\,s^{-1}}$, while the QLF turnover\noccurs at $\\gtrsim20$ times higher luminosity.

A major challenge in\nthe simulations is in modelling of the outermost layers, known as the envelope,\nexhibiting a drop of many orders of magnitude in temperature and density in a\ngeometrically thin shell. This is often addressed by constructing a separate\nenvelope model in plane-parallel approximation that produces a relation between\nthe temperature at the bottom of the envelope, $T_b$, and the surface\ntemperature, $T_s$. Our aim is to construct a general framework for\napproximating the $T_b$-$T_s$ relation that is able to include the dependencies\nfrom the strength and orientation of the magnetic field. We used standard\nprescriptions to calculate a large number of magnetised envelope models to be\nused as a training sample and employed single-hidden-layer feedforward neural\nnetworks as approximators, providing the flexibility, high accuracy, and fast\nevaluation necessary in neutron star simulations.

I present six clear, convincing examples of bar-like galaxies\nformed after an interaction with a progenitor of a massive brightest cluster\ngalaxy (BCG) and describe the properties of their bars. For the whole sample,\nthe time of bar formation is strongly correlated with and typically slightly\ngreater than the time of the pericenter passage. All galaxies are strongly\nstripped of dark matter and gas, and their rotation is similarly diminished. A\nlarger pericenter distance typically requires a higher host mass in order to\ntransform the galaxy, but the interactions show no preference for prograde\nconfigurations. The final strength of the bars does not correlate with the\namount of tidal stripping experienced because of the variety of initial\nproperties of the progenitors and the subsequent evolution over the next\npericenter passages.

In hierarchical models\nlike CDM, massive galaxies assemble following successive mergers of smaller\ngalaxies. Thus, inferences of the growth of stellar mass using the ages of\nstars within a descendant massive galaxy will be biased. In this paper, I use\nthe TNG100 simulation to quantify this bias across a range of descendant galaxy\nmasses and redshifts, for inferences made for different past epochs.

Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "Aims. We derive the stellar mass function (SMF) of quiescent and star-forming\ngalaxies at z <= 0.2 using 12-band optical photometry from the third data\nrelease (DR3) of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS) over\n3,284 deg^2. Methods. We select approximately 890,000 galaxies with r <= 20 mag\nand photometric redshifts in the range 0.05 <= z <= 0.20. Stellar masses and\nstar formation rates were derived through spectral energy distribution fitting\nwith CIGALE, confronted with spectroscopic samples. Galaxies are classified as\nstar-forming or quiescent based on their specific star formation rate (sSFR),\nadopting log(sSFR [yr^-1]) = -10.2. We compute SMFs for both populations using\nthe 1/Vmax method, apply completeness corrections, and fit Schechter functions.\nResults. The SMFs from J-PLUS DR3 are well described by Schechter functions and\nagree with previous photometric and spectroscopic studies. The characteristic\nmass for quiescent galaxies, log(M*/Msun) = 10.80, is 0.4 dex larger than that\nof star-forming galaxies. The faint-end slope is steeper for star-forming\ngalaxies (alpha = -1.2) than for quiescent ones (alpha = -0.7). The quiescent\nfraction rises by 40 percent per dex in stellar mass, reaching fQ > 0.95 at\nlog(M*/Msun) > 11. Comparisons with the GAEA semi-analytic model reveal an\nexcess of star-forming galaxies at intermediate masses. Conclusions. J-PLUS DR3\nstellar mass functions and quiescent fractions are consistent with the\nliterature and provide robust constraints for galaxy formation models.\nQuiescent galaxies represent 45 percent of number density above log(M*) > 9,\nbut 75 percent of stellar mass density. The use of 12 optical bands, including\n7 narrow filters, improves redshift precision by 20 percent, enabling more\naccurate SED fitting and galaxy classification."}

Aims: We focus on the S3 stream, a long ($\\sim30^\\circ$) and narrow\n($\\sim1.2^\\circ$) structure at 60-80 kpc, nearly aligned with the LMC. Our\ngoals are: 1) to validate the stream through a kinematic analysis of S3\ncandidates with Gaia DR3 data; 2) to enlarge the sample of potential members;\nand 3) to model the stream in order to test its association with either the MW\nor the LMC. Methods: We selected new S3 candidates with a neural network\nclassifier trained on Gaia DR3 data, and further reduced contamination through\na cut in the proper-motion space. To investigate the origin of S3, we evolve\nstream models within time-dependent, deforming MW and LMC haloes, thereby\naccounting for possible effects of the MW-LMC interaction. Results: We identify\n1,542 high-confidence new S3 stream candidates and find that the stream's\napparent width has grown from $\\sim1.2^\\circ$ to $\\sim3$-$4^\\circ$ compared to\nprevious studies. We also present a list of 440 potential S3 red clump stars,\nwhich are valuable targets for spectroscopic follow-up thanks to their\nwell-defined luminosities and ability to yield precise distances. Both\nmodelling and a comparison of S3 stars' closest approach distance and velocity\nwith the LMC's escape velocity indicate that S3 is unlikely to originate from\nthe LMC, instead representing a distant ($\\sim75$ kpc) MW stream.

The normalized amplitudes of the RR Lyrae stars from\nGaia and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) are consistent with the J-VAR\ntrend. Finally, the SDSS templates derived from broadbands also provide a\nproper description for the medium and narrow band light curves. Conclusions.\nThe J-VAR RR Lyrae catalog offers reliable pulsation parameters and light\ncurves in seven optical filters, allowing the systematic study of amplitude\ntrends from 395 to 860 nm and offering a unique benchmark for theoretical\nmodels."}

Comprehensive studies of intensive multi-wavelength monitoring\nand surveys of local and high-redshift AGNs have shown that X-ray illumination\nof AGN accretion discs is a potential explanation for the observed variability.\nOur main objective is to study the UV/optical power spectra of AGNs under the\nassumption of X-ray reverberation and to test whether this model can explain\nthe observed power spectra of distant quasars. To do this, we computed the disc\ntransfer function in the case of X-ray reverberation using a recent physical\nmodel and studied its dependence on the parameters of the model. This model\nallows us to explore the variability of X-ray illuminated discs under the\nscenario in which the X-ray corona is powered by the accretion process or by an\nexternal source. We then calculated UV/optical power spectra using the disc\ntransfer function and assuming a bending power law for the X-ray power\nspectrum. We fitted our models to the observed power spectra of quasars\ndetermined by a recent power spectrum analysis of the SDSS Stripe-82 light\ncurves. We demonstrate that X-ray reverberation can fit the power spectra of\nquasars in our sample well at all wavelengths, from $\\sim 1300$\\AA\\ up to\n$4000$\\AA. Our best-fit models imply that the X-ray corona is powered by the\naccretion disc, and that the black hole spin is probably lower than 0.7, while\nthe X-ray corona height is in the range of $20 - 60 R_{g}$. This is in\nagreement with previous findings from the application of the X-ray\nreverberation model to the quasar micro-lensing disc size problem, as well as\nrecent time-lag measurements."}

To constrain the origin of 3I/ATLAS\nand its past dynamical evolution, we propagate the orbits of 3I/ATLAS and\nnearby stars to search for stellar encounters. Integrating orbits in the\nGalactic potential and propagating the astrometric and radial-velocity\nuncertainties of 30 million Gaia stars, we identify 25 encounters with median\nencounter distances less than 1 pc. However, because the encounter speeds\nbetween 3I/ATLAS and each encounter exceed 20 km/s, none is a plausible host\nunder common ejection mechanisms. We infer stellar masses for most stars and\nquantify the gravitational perturbations exerted by each individual star or\neach binary system on 3I/ATLAS. The strongest gravitational scattering\nperturber is a wide M-dwarf binary. Among all past encounters, the binary's\nbarycenter and 3I/ATLAS reach the small encounter distance of 0.242 pc and the\nencounter speed of 28.39 km/s,1.64 Myr ago. We further demonstrate that the\ncumulative influence of the stellar encounters on both the speed and direction\nof 3I/ATLAS is weak. Based on the present kinematics of 3I/ATLAS to assess its\norigin, we find that a thin-disk origin is strongly favored, because the thin\ndisk both exhibits a velocity distribution closely matching that of 3I/ATLAS\nand provides the dominant local number density of stars."}

This is due in part to its sparseness and low\nproper motion, which together made Coma Ber's membership challenging to\nestablish. Gaia data for $\\approx$400 previously cataloged candidate cluster\nstars allowed us to identify $\\approx$300 as members. With [Fe/H] measurements\nfor nine members, we found that Coma Ber has a solar metallicity, and then fit\nisochrones to its color--magnitude diagram to determine that it is 675$\\pm$100\nMyr old. With photometry obtained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite\n(TESS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), we measured rotation periods for\n137 of Coma Ber's low-mass stars, increasing the sample of members with\nmeasured periods by a factor of six, and extending the rotational census for\nthe cluster from its late F stars through to its fully convective M dwarfs. By\nmeasuring the equivalent width of the H$\\alpha$ line for $\\approx$250 stars and\ncollecting X-ray detections for $\\approx$100 ($\\approx$85% and $\\approx$33% of\nthe cluster's members, respectively), we characterized magnetic activity in\nComa Ber and examined the dependence of chromospheric and of coronal activity\non rotation in these stars. Despite having a metallicity that is 0.2 dex below\nthat of their coeval cousins in Praesepe and the Hyades, low-mass stars in Coma\nBer seem to follow a similar rotation--activity relation. In detail, however,\nthere are differences that may provide further insight into the impact of\nmetallicity on this still poorly understood relation."}
