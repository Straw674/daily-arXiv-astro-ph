Abstract: We describe a resonant cavity search apparatus for axion dark matter
constructed by the Quantum Sensors for the Hidden Sector (QSHS) collaboration.
The apparatus is configured to search for QCD axion dark matter, though also
has the capability to detect axion-like particles (ALPs), dark photons, and
some other forms of wave-like dark matter. Initially, a tuneable cylindrical
oxygen-free copper cavity is read out using a low noise microwave amplifier
feeding a heterodyne receiver. The cavity is housed in a dilution refrigerator
and threaded by a solenoidal magnetic field, nominally 8T. The apparatus also
houses a magnetic field shield for housing superconducting electronics, and
several other fixed-frequency resonators for use in testing and commissioning
various prototype quantum electronic devices sensitive at a range of axion
masses in the range $\rm 2.0$ to $\rm 40\,eV/c^2$. We present performance data
for the resonator, dilution refrigerator, and magnet, and plans for the first
science run.

### [3] [A Machine Learning Framework for Stellar Collision Transient Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11529)
*Betty X. Hu,Avi Loeb*

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于机器学习的系统化流程，用于从大规模瞬变巡天数据中识别和表征恒星碰撞候选事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  
Background: 现代天文巡天项目（如ZTF）每年可检测数千次瞬变事件，需要自动化且可扩展的数据分析技术。机器学习的最新进展使得这些瞬变现象的高效分类和表征成为可能。

Data: 使用了ZTF巡天观测到的光变曲线数据。

Method: 生成了一个涵盖多种物理参数的模拟光变曲线库，并采用近似最近邻算法（通过annoy库）将其与观测到的ZTF光变曲线进行匹配。

Result: 成功将观测到的ZTF光变曲线与模拟事件关联，并估计了关键物理参数（如超大质量黑洞质量和喷出物质量），验证了机器学习方法在识别恒星碰撞候选事件中的有效性。

Abstract: Modern astronomical surveys, such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), are
capable of detecting thousands of transient events per year, necessitating the
use of automated and scalable data analysis techniques. Recent advances in
machine learning have enabled the efficient classification and characterization
of these transient phenomena. We aim to develop a fully systematic pipeline to
identify candidate stellar collision events in galactic nuclei, which may
otherwise be identified as tidal disruption events or other transients. We also
seek to validate our simulations by comparing key physical parameters derived
from observations and used in modeling these events. We generate a
comprehensive bank of simulated light curves spanning a range of physical
parameters and employ an approximate nearest neighbor algorithm (via the annoy
library) to match these with observed ZTF light curves. Our pipeline is
successfully able to associate observed ZTF light curves with simulated events.
The resulting estimated parameters, including supermassive black hole masses
and ejecta mass, are presented and compared to known values when applicable. We
demonstrate that a systematic, machine learning-based approach can effectively
identify and characterize stellar collision candidate events from large-scale
transient surveys. This methodology is especially promising for future surveys
which will provide us with significantly high volumes of data, such as LSST,
where automated, data-intensive analysis will be critical for advancing our
understanding of transient astrophysical phenomena.

### [4] [Understanding the impact of satellites on radio astronomy observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11561)
*M. Peel,S. Eggl,M. L. Rawls,H. Qiu,D. L. Clements*

TL;DR: 卫星在无线电频率上的活跃传输对射电天文观测构成挑战，亟需研究其对未来天文观测的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  
Background: 射电望远镜观测到的天文信号极其微弱，而卫星在无线电频率上的活跃传输（尤其是10-20 GHz）可能干扰观测，即使偏远地区也无法避免。

Data: 观测数据包括卫星在无线电频率上的主动传输、无意传输、热辐射及其他非预期辐射。

Method: 通过国际天文学联合会（IAU）的保护天空与无线电干扰委员会（CPS）进行持续研究。

Result: 总结了当前卫星无线电传输对天文观测的影响，并探讨了未来卫星数量增加的长远后果。

Abstract: Radio telescopes observe extremely faint emission from astronomical objects,
ranging from compact sources to large scale structures that can be seen across
the whole sky. Satellites actively transmit at radio frequencies (particularly
at 10--20\,GHz, but usage of increasing broader frequency ranges are already
planned for the future by satellite operators), and can appear as bright as the
Sun in radio astronomy observations. Remote locations have historically enabled
telescopes to avoid most interference, however this is no longer the case with
dramatically increasing numbers of satellites that transmit everywhere on
Earth. Even more remote locations such as the far side of the Moon may provide
new radio astronomy observation opportunities, but only if they are protected
from satellite transmissions. Improving our understanding of satellite
transmissions on radio telescopes across the whole spectrum and beyond is
urgently needed to overcome this new observational challenge, as part of
ensuring the future access to dark and quiet skies.
  In this contribution we summarise the current status of observations of
active satellites at radio frequencies, the implications for future
astronomical observations, and the longer-term consequences of an increasing
number of active satellites. This will include frequencies where satellites
actively transmit, where they unintentionally also transmit, and considerations
about thermal emission and other unintended emissions. This work is ongoing
through the IAU CPS.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的自动化流程，用于改进近地小行星（NEAs）的检测能力，减少对人工干预的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  
Background: 当前Zwicky瞬变设施（ZTF）采用的方法依赖人工干预，研究旨在通过自动化流程提升检测效率。

Data: 使用了三组数据集：真实小行星条纹、合成条纹及混合数据集。

Method: 采用卷积神经网络（CNN）训练模型检测小行星条纹。

Result: 模型在完整性和精确度上表现一致，检测到80%的人工标记条纹及697个额外条纹，证明合成数据可用于训练集增强。

Abstract: We present a novel pipeline that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to
improve the detection capability of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) in the context
of planetary defense. Our work aims to minimize the dependency on human
intervention of the current approach adopted by the Zwicky Transient Facility
(ZTF). The target NEAs have a high proper motion of up to tens of degrees per
day and thus appear as streaks of light in the images. We trained our CNNs to
detect these streaks using three datasets: a set with real asteroid streaks, a
set with synthetic (i.e., simulated) streaks and a mixed set, and tested the
resultant models on real survey images. The results achieved were almost
identical across the three models: $0.843\pm0.005$ in completeness and
$0.820\pm0.025$ in precision. The bias on streak measurements reported by the
CNNs was $1.84\pm0.03$ pixels in streak position, $0.817\pm0.026$ degrees in
streak angle and $-0.048\pm0.003$ in fractional bias in streak length (computed
as the absolute length bias over the streak length, with the negative sign
indicating an underestimation). We compared the performance of our CNN trained
with a mix of synthetic and real streaks to that of the ZTF human scanners by
analyzing a set of 317 streaks flagged as valid by the scanners. Our pipeline
detected $80~\%$ of the streaks found by the scanners and 697 additional
streaks that were subsequently verified by the scanners to be valid streaks.
These results suggest that our automated pipeline can complement the work of
the human scanners at no cost for the precision and find more objects than the
current approach. They also prove that the synthetic streaks were realistic
enough to be used for augmenting training sets when insufficient real streaks
are available or exploring the simulation of streaks with unusual
characteristics that have not yet been detected.

Background: 射频干扰（RFI）是射电天文日益严峻的挑战，随着观测灵敏度和轨道RFI源的增加而加剧。

Data: 使用了来自氢再电离纪元阵列（HERA）仪器的模拟数据。

Method: 采用脉冲神经网络（SNN）结合极化信息进行RFI检测。

Result: 初步结果显示该方法具有最先进的检测精度和显著的能效优势。

Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is a known growing challenge for radio
astronomy, intensified by increasing observatory sensitivity and prevalence of
orbital RFI sources. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising solution
for real-time RFI detection by exploiting the time-varying nature of radio
observation and neuron dynamics together. This work explores the inclusion of
polarisation information in SNN-based RFI detection, using simulated data from
the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA) instrument and provides power
usage estimates for deploying SNN-based RFI detection on existing neuromorphic
hardware. Preliminary results demonstrate state-of-the-art detection accuracy
and highlight possible extensive energy-efficiency gains.

### [7] [Detecting Ultralight Dark Matter with Matter Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11522)
*Xucheng Gan,Da Liu,Di Liu,Xuheng Luo,Bingrong Yu*

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  
Background: Error

Data: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Abstract: Ultralight particles, with a mass below the electronvolt scale, exhibit
wave-like behavior and have arisen as a compelling dark matter candidate. A
particularly intriguing subclass is scalar dark matter, which induces
variations in fundamental physical constants. However, detecting such particles
becomes highly challenging in the mass range above $10^{-6}\,\text{eV}$, as
traditional experiments face severe limitations in response time. In contrast,
the matter effect becomes significant in a vast and unexplored parameter space.
These effects include (i) a force arising from scattering between ordinary
matter and the dark matter wind and (ii) a fifth force between ordinary matter
induced by the dark matter background. Using the repulsive quadratic
scalar-photon interaction as a case study, we develop a unified framework based
on quantum mechanical scattering theory to systematically investigate these
phenomena across both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. Our approach
not only reproduces prior results obtained through other methodologies but also
covers novel regimes with nontrivial features, such as decoherence effects,
screening effects, and their combinations. In particular, we highlight one
finding related to both scattering and background-induced forces: the
descreening effect observed in the non-perturbative region with large incident
momentum, which alleviates the decoherence suppression. Furthermore, we discuss
current and proposed experiments, including inverse-square-law tests,
equivalence principle tests, and deep-space acceleration measurements. Notably,
we go beyond the spherical approximation and revisit the MICROSCOPE constraints
on the background-induced force in the large-momentum regime, where the
decoherence and screening effects interplay. The ultraviolet models realizing
the quadratic scalar-photon interaction are also discussed.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了亚GeV质量的轻弱相互作用大质量粒子（WIMPs）的模型参数区域，并评估了COSI任务对其探测的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  
Background: 传统WIMPs的搜索结果为阴性，导致亚GeV质量的轻WIMPs受到更多关注，其湮灭产生的MeV能量区伽马射线可能被COSI任务探测。

Data: 使用了来自宇宙学观测（CMB、BBN）和暗物质搜索（加速器、地下、天体物理实验等）的数据。

Method: 基于量子场论的最小性和可重整性构建模型，并施加多种约束条件。

Result: 发现某些区域存在速度依赖的湮灭截面，使COSI能探测暗物质信号，同时避免宇宙学观测的严格限制。

Abstract: Light weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), whose masses are in the
sub-GeV scale, have been attracting more attention due to the negative results
searching for traditional WIMPs. The light WIMPs are expected to produce gamma
rays from annihilation in the MeV energy region. Advancements in technology
have opened up possibilities to precisely detect MeV gamma rays, leading to the
upcoming space-based mission of the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). We
comprehensively and quantitatively study the phenomenology of light WIMPs to
determine if the COSI observations will probe their viable model parameter
regions. We first construct models to describe light WIMPs based on the
minimality and renormalizability of quantum field theory. Next, we impose
various constraints on the models obtained from cosmological observations (CMB,
BBN) and dark matter searches (accelerator, underground, astrophysical
experiments, etc.). Finally, we identify viable parameter regions in each model
and discuss whether or not COSI will be sensitive to the parameter regions. We
find that a velocity-dependent annihilation cross-section is predicted in some
regions, enabling COSI to detect the dark matter signal while avoiding severe
constraints from cosmological observations.

*Ignatios Antoniadis,John Ellis,Wenqi Ke,Dimitri V. Nanopoulos,Keith A. Olive*

TL;DR: 通过弦理论实现Starobinsky模型，解决膨胀初始条件和沼泽地问题，同时符合CMB数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  
Background: 当前研究通过CMB数据区分不同膨胀模型，但Starobinsky模型存在理论问题，如大初始场值和沼泽地距离猜想。

Data: Planck、ACT和DESI BAO数据。

Method: 基于弦理论的Starobinsky模型实现，计算变形参数。

Result: 解决了初始条件和沼泽地问题，预测与CMB数据兼容的膨胀初始条件是普遍的。

Abstract: Data on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are discriminating between
different models of inflation, disfavoring simple monomial potentials whilst
being consistent with models whose predictions resemble those of the
Starobinsky $R + R^2$ cosmological model. However, this model may suffer from
theoretical problems, since it requires a large initial field value,
threatening the validity of the effective field theory. This is quantified by
the Swampland Distance Conjecture, which predicts the appearance of a tower of
light states associated with an effective ultra-violet cutoff. This could be
lower than the inflation scale for cases with an extended period of inflation,
leading to an additional problem of initial conditions. No-scale supergravity
models can reproduce the predictions of the Starobinsky model and accommodate
the CMB data at the expense of fine-tuning of parameters at the level of
$10^{-5}$. Here, we propose a solution to this problem based on an explicit
realisation of the Starobinsky model in string theory, where this `deformation'
parameter is calculable and takes a value of order of the one corresponding to
the Starobinsky inflaton potential. Within this range, there are parameter
values that accommodate more easily the combination of Planck, ACT and DESI BAO
data, while also restricting the range of possible inflaton field values,
thereby avoiding the swampland problem and predicting that the initial
conditions for inflation compatible with the CMB data are generic.

TL;DR: 通过高分辨率风洞模拟研究两个大质量星系在剥离过程中尾部原位恒星形成的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  
Background: 研究背景涉及大质量星系（$M_\text{star}=10^{11}M_\odot$）在时间演化过程中受到不同角度（正面和倾斜）的冲压剥离作用。

Data: 使用高分辨率风洞模拟数据。

Method: 采用高分辨率风洞模拟方法，分析两种不同剥离角度（W0和W45）下的恒星形成过程。

Result: 研究发现尾部恒星主要在剥离初期靠近星系盘形成，年龄分布呈现由外向内剥离的特征；部分恒星（15-25%）具有负速度，表明气体回落到星系；尾部恒星对星系内光贡献可忽略，且其轨道导致星系周围形成不对称的恒星分布。

Abstract: We conduct high-resolution wind-tunnel simulations to study in-situ star
formation in the stripped tails of two massive ($M_\text{star}=10^{11}M_\odot$)
galaxies undergoing time-evolving ram-pressure stripping: one is stripped
face-on (W0) and the other is subject to an angled wind (W45). We find that the
majority of stars in the tail are formed close to the galaxy disc at the
beginning of stripping. Most stars have ages that reflect outside-in stripping
-- older stars are found at larger radii than younger stars. The velocities and
metallicities of stars indicate that ICM mixing both increases the velocity and
decreases the metallicity of star-forming gas, leading to faster, lower
metallicity stars at larger distances from the galaxies. However, not all stars
follow this simple model, even in the case of face-on stripping. Indeed, a
considerable number (15--25 per cent) of tail stars are formed with negative
velocities, indicating the fallback of star-forming gas on to the galaxy.
Almost all of the tail stars formed within 20 kpc from the disc will eventually
fall back on to the galaxy, and their contribution to the intracluster light is
negligible. The orbits of the stars formed in the tail result in an extended
(and asymmetric in the case of W45) stellar distribution around the disc. Mock
UV images reveal that the observed vertical distribution of its stars is not
significantly broader than in an undisturbed galaxy, indicating that more stars
would need to form in the stripped tail than we find in our simulations to
observably impact the UV disc width of ram pressure stripped galaxies.

TL;DR: 研究通过Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam窄带成像和光谱观测，发现了一个名为Oxyster的大型电离星云，围绕着一个相互作用的星暴星系，揭示了其独特的低[OIII]/[OII]比例和可能的星暴与低光度AGN组合的起源。

Background: 扩展发射线星云（EELRs）为研究星系或活动星系核（AGNs）周围的星系生态系统提供了独特窗口。当前研究通过窄带成像和光谱观测，探索了高红移星系周围的星云特性。

Data: 使用Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam窄带成像和光谱观测数据，以及HST和JWST图像。

Method: 通过窄带成像和光谱观测分析星云的发射线特性，并结合SED拟合和X射线/射电连续谱的非探测结果。

Result: 发现Oxyster星云具有独特的低[OIII]/[OII]比例，可能由星暴和低光度AGN共同作用形成，为研究早期宇宙中正常星系的CGM提供了新途径。

Abstract: Extended emission line nebulae around galaxies or active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) provide a unique window to investigate the galactic ecosystem through
the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Using Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam narrow-band
imaging and spectroscopic follow-up, we serendipitously discover "Oxyster" - a
large ionized nebula next to an interacting starburst galaxy at $z=0.924$. The
nebula is traced by extended [OII]3726,3729 ($\sim 30$ kpc) and [OIII]5007
($\sim 20$ kpc) emission lines. On the nebula luminosity-size plane, Oxyster
surpasses the extended narrow-line regions around low-$z$ AGNs, resembling a
higher-$z$ analog of "Hanny's Voorwerp". However, its uniformly low
[OIII]/[OII] ratio (O32) sets it apart from typical AGN light echoes. For the
host galaxy, HST and JWST images reveal a disturbed red disk galaxy with a
single blue spiral "arm". Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting suggests
the $2-6\times 10^{10} ~\rm M_{\odot}$ host galaxy sits above the star-forming
main sequence with an ongoing starburst, especially in the "arm", and have
$<5\%$ luminosity contribution from AGN, consistent with X-ray non-detection
and radio continuum. Standard photoionization and shock models struggle to
explain simultaneously Oxyster's emission line luminosities, low O32 ratio, and
the non-detection of H$\beta$ line. A plausible explanation could involve the
combination of a recent ($<10^8$ yrs) starburst and a low-luminosity AGN
($L_{\rm{bol}} \sim 1\times10^{42}$ erg/s). While Oxyster's nature awaits
future investigation, its discovery highlights the potential of ground-based
narrow-band imaging to uncover extended emission line nebulae around non-AGN
systems, opening new avenues for studying the CGM of normal galaxies in the
early Universe.

Background: 微引力透镜事件是探测孤立、非发光天体（尤其是暗恒星残骸）质量和存在的独特方法，特别是在光变曲线显示有限源效应时。

Data: 使用Gaia Alerts和Gaia Data Release 3数据集。

Method: 通过分析高放大倍率微引力透镜事件的光变曲线，结合DarkLensCode软件，约束有限源效应并估算透镜质量、距离和亮度分布。

Result: 确定了四个透镜事件的质量下限（0.2-0.5 M⊙），DarkLensCode分析支持透镜为恒星残骸（质量范围0.42-1.66 M⊙，暗透镜概率超过60%）。

Abstract: Microlensing events provide a unique way to detect and measure the masses of
isolated, non-luminous objects, particularly dark stellar remnants. Under
certain conditions, it is possible to measure the mass of these objects using
photometry alone, specifically when a microlensing light curve displays a
finite-source (FS) effect. This effect generally occurs in highly magnified
light curves, i.e. when the source and the lens are very well aligned. In this
study, we analyse Gaia Alerts and Gaia Data Release 3 datasets, identifying
four moderate-to-high-magnification microlensing events without a discernible
FS effect. The absence of this effect suggests a large Einstein radius,
implying substantial lens masses. In each event, we constrain the FS effect and
therefore establish lower limits for angular Einstein radius and lens mass.
Additionally, we use the DarkLensCode software to obtain mass, distance, and
brightness distribution for the lens based on the Galactic model. Our analysis
established lower mass limits of $\sim 0.2$ $M_{\odot}$ for one lens and $\sim
0.3-0.5$ $M_{\odot}$ for two others. DarkLensCode analysis supports these
findings, estimating lens masses in the range of$\sim 0.42-1.66$ $M_{\odot}$
and dark lens probabilities exceeding 60\%. These results strongly indicate
that the lenses are stellar remnants, such as white dwarfs or neutron stars.
While further investigations are required to confirm the nature of these
lenses, we demonstrate a straightforward yet effective approach to identifying
stellar remnant candidates.

Method: 采用半解析模型（SAMs）分析SMBH质量增长和吸积历史，特别关注Dark Sage模型中允许的超爱丁顿吸积机制。

Result: 物理模型在局部BHMF与观测存在差异，但在高红移下与JWST观测一致；Dark Sage模型预测的AGN光度演化与“小红点”观测相符，且SMBH主要通过盘不稳定性和冷气体吸积增长，黑洞合并仅对最巨大SMBH的质量贡献显著。

Abstract: Galaxies grow alongside their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs),
linked through fueling and feedback. However, the origins and details of this
co-evolution remain unclear and differ significantly amongst modeling
frameworks. Using a suite of semi-analytic models (SAMs), we trace SMBH mass
assembly across $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{6-10}, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We find
significant discrepancies between observations and physics-based models of the
local black hole mass function (BHMF), likely due to differences in the
underlying stellar mass function and the scaling relations therefrom used to
infer the BHMF. However, most physics-based models agree at $z \sim 1-4$ and
align reasonably well with broad-line AGN BHMF from JWST observations at
$z=4-5$. Most physics-based models reproduce the bolometric AGN luminosity
evolution, except {\sc Dark Sage}, which predicts an excess deviating from
models and observations. Interestingly, this pronounced ``knee' in the
bolometric AGN luminosity function predicted by {\sc Dark Sage} around $L_{\rm
bol} \sim 10^{46} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ is consistent with the inferred
luminosity of ``Little Red Dots'' at $z=5-6$, assuming that their entire
emission originates from AGN activity. We analyze black hole mass build-up and
accretion histories in {\sc Dark Sage}, which, unlike other models, allows for
super-Eddington accretion. We report that on average, SMBHs in {\sc Dark Sage}
primarily grow through secular disk instabilities and merger-driven cold gas
accretion, while black hole mergers contribute 60\% of the total mass budget
only for the most massive SMBHs by $z=0$.

Abstract: Chemodynamical tagging has been suggested as a powerful tool to trace stars
back to their birth clusters. However, the efficacy of chemodynamical tagging
as a means to recover individual stellar clusters is still under debate. In
this study, we present a detailed investigation of chemodynamical tagging of
open clusters using both dynamical and chemical data from the \textit{Gaia} DR3
and GALAH DR4 surveys, respectively. Using a sample of open clusters and mock
field stars, we conduct a bootstrap analysis to evaluate every unique
combination of orbital components ($E, J_R, J_\phi, J_Z$) and chemical
abundances ([X/Fe] for O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Y, and
Ba) on how well they recover open clusters when used as parameters in the
clustering algorithm, HBDSCAN. We find that using primarily dynamical orbital
parameters leads to the highest recovery rate of open cluster stars.
Nevertheless, even employing the best performing parameter combinations leads
to low open cluster recovery rates. We find that, in most cases, chemodynamical
tagging of open clusters using blind clustering algorithms is not efficient,
which is in line with previous theoretical and observational work. However, we
show that the addition of cuts based on metallicity, age, and birth radii in
order to reduce the size of the clustering catalog can marginally improve the
recovery rate of open clusters.

Abstract: The local universe is still full of hidden dwarf galaxies to be discovered
using deep imaging campaigns. Here we present the third paper in a series to
search for low-surface brightness dwarf galaxies around nearby isolated
luminous host galaxies with the Subaru Hyper Suprime Camera. Based on visual
inspection, we found 11, 0, 4, and 6 dwarf galaxy candidates around M106,
NGC2903, NGC3521, and UGCA127, respectively. This adds to the 40 candidates
around M104 and 4 candidates around NGC2683 found in the previous papers.
Artificial galaxy experiments show that we are complete down to a mean
effective surface brightness of 26 mag/arcsec$^2$. The new dwarf galaxy
candidates follow known scaling relation in size, surface brightness and
luminosity, making them good candidates based on their morphology and
photometric properties. We trace the luminosity function of these galaxies down
to magnitude of $\approx-$9 in the V band for all galaxies targeted in our
survey footprint so far. While the most massive galaxy (M104) has a significant
higher abundance of dwarfs, NGC3521, NGC2903, and NGC2683 have a similar
luminosity function as the Milky Way. These latter three galaxies also have a
similar stellar mass and might be considered Milky Way analogs. UGCA127 is a
low-mass galaxy but almost reaches the same number of dwarfs as the Milky Way
at our limiting magnitude. We have searched for hints of lopsidedness in the
satellite distributions, but found none to be significant. The next step will
be to confirm these members through either distance or velocity measurements.

Abstract: Spiral arms are a common feature of local galaxies, but the exact form of the
distribution of mass and light in them is not well known. In this work, we aim
to measure this distribution as accurately as possible, focusing on individual
spiral arms and using the so-called slicing method. The sample consists of 19
well-resolved, viewed face-on spiral galaxies from the S$^4$G survey. We work
primarily with infrared images at 3.6 $\mu$m from the same survey, and,
secondarily, with ultraviolet data from the GALEX telescope. We derive the
properties of the spiral arms step by step, starting from their overall shape,
then measuring their brightness profile and width variation along the arm, and
then examining the fine structure of the profile across the arm, namely its
skewness and S\'{e}rsic index. We construct a 2D photometric function of the
spiral arm that can be used in further decomposition studies, validate it and
identify the most and least important parameters. Finally, we show how our
results can be used to unravel the nature of the spiral arms, supporting the
evidence that NGC 4535 has a density wave in its disc.

Background: The census of stellar streams and dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way is crucial for galaxy formation models and understanding dark matter.

Result: Discovery of the Cocytos stream: metal-rich ([Fe/H]=-1.3), thick (width=1.5°), at 25 kpc, with velocity dispersion of 6.5-9 km/s, likely a disrupted globular cluster from Gaia-Enceladus merger, associated with Pyxis globular cluster.

Abstract: The census of stellar streams and dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way provides
direct constraints on galaxy formation models and the nature of dark matter.
The DESI Milky Way survey (with a footprint of 14,000$~deg{^2}$ and a depth of
$r<19$ mag) delivers the largest sample of distant metal-poor stars compared to
previous optical fiber-fed spectroscopic surveys. This makes DESI an ideal
survey to search for previously undetected streams and dwarf galaxies. We
present a detailed characterization of the Cocytos stream, which was
re-discovered using a clustering analysis with a catalog of giants in the DESI
year 3 data, supplemented with Magellan/MagE spectroscopy. Our analysis reveals
a relatively metal-rich ([Fe/H]$=-1.3$) and thick stream (width$=1.5^\circ$) at
a heliocentric distance of $\approx 25$ kpc, with an internal velocity
dispersion of 6.5-9 km s$^{-1}$. The stream's metallicity, radial orbit, and
proximity to the Virgo stellar overdensities suggest that it is most likely a
disrupted globular cluster that came in with the Gaia-Enceladus merger. We also
confirm its association with the Pyxis globular cluster. Our result showcases
the ability of wide-field spectroscopic surveys to kinematically discover faint
disrupted dwarfs and clusters, enabling constraints on the dark matter
distribution in the Milky Way.

Abstract: We characterise the rest-frame 1500 \r{A} UV luminosity Function (UVLF) from
deep AstroSat/UVIT F154W and N242W imaging in the Great Observatories Origins
Survey South (GOODS-S) deep field. The UVLFs are constructed and subsequently
characterised with fitted Schechter function parameters from FUV observations
at z$<0.13$ and NUV observations in seven redshift bins in z~0.8-0.4. The UVLF
slope ($\alpha$) and characteristic magnitude ($M^*$) are consistent with
previous determinations for this redshift range based on AstroSat/UVIT
GOODS-North observations, as well as with those from Galaxy evolution Explorer
and Hubble Space Telescope observations. However, differences in the
normalisation factor ($\phi_{*}$) are present for UVLFs for some redshift bins.
We compute the UV luminosity density, $\rho_{\rm UV}$, combining our determined
UVLF parameters with literature determinations out to z$\sim10$. The $\rho_{\rm
UV}$ trend with redshift implies the rapid increase in cosmic star formation
till its peak at z$\sim3$ (cosmic noon) followed by a slow decline till present
day. Both the initial increase in cosmic star formation and subsequent decline
are found to be more rapid than previous determinations.

Result: 研究发现总质量约$10^{11}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$的核心坍缩暗物质晕与观测数据部分一致，但未观测到预期宿主星系，模型解释存在困难。

Abstract: Previous studies, based on precise modeling of a gravitationally lensing
image, have identified what may be a extremely compact, dark perturber in the
well-known lensing system SDSSJ0946+1006 (the "Jackpot"). Its remarkable
compactness challenges the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. In this
paper, we explore whether such a compact perturber could be explained as a
core-collapsed halo described by the self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model.
Using the isothermal Jeans method, we compute the density profiles of
core-collapsed halos across a range of masses. Our comparison with observations
indicates that only a core-collapsed halo with a total mass of approximately
$10^{11}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ could produce an inner density profile and mass
enclosed within 1 kpc that is consistent with observational data. However, such
a massive dark matter halo should host a galaxy detectable by prior Hubble
imaging, which is not observed. Thus, the core-collapsed SIDM halo model
struggles to fully account for the exotic nature of the "little dark dot" in
the "Jackpot" lens.

Abstract: It is established that there exists a direct link between the formation
history of star cluster populations and their host galaxies, however, our
lacking understanding of star cluster assembly prohibits us to make full use of
their ability to trace galaxy evolution. In this work we introduce a new
variation of the 2020 version of the semi-analytical galaxy formation model
"L-Galaxies" that includes the formation of star clusters above 10^4 M_Sun and
probes different physical assumptions that affect their evolution over cosmic
time. We use properties of different galaxy components and localised star
formation to determine the bound fraction of star formation in disks. After
randomly sampling masses from an environmentally-dependent star cluster initial
mass function, we assign to each object a half-mass radius, metallicity, and
distance from the galaxy centre. We consider up to 2000 individual star
clusters per galaxy and evolve their properties over time taking into account
stellar evolution, two-body relaxation, tidal shocks, dynamical friction, and a
re-positioning during galaxy mergers. Our simulation successfully reproduces
several observational quantities, such as the empirical relationship between
the absolute V -band magnitude of the brightest young star clusters and the
host galaxy star formation rate, the mass function of young star clusters, or
mean metallicities of the star cluster distributions versus galaxy masses. The
simulation reveals great complexity in the z = 0 star cluster population
resulting from differential destruction channels and origins, including in-situ
populations in the disk, a major merger-induced heated component in the halo,
and accreted star clusters. Model variations point out the importance of e.g.
the shape of the star cluster initial mass function or the relationship between
the sound speed of cold gas and the star formation rate.

Result: The protocluster contains medium-mass star-forming galaxies, showing spatial offsets from other galaxy populations and suggesting evolved structure.

Abstract: We present a narrowband imaging on a spectroscopically confirmed protocluster
``D4UD01'' at z=3.24 using CFHT/WIRCam. We identify a sample of 24 [O III]
emission line galaxies in the field, which forms a large overdensity in the
protocluster region. The protocluster is expected to evolve into a Virgo-like
cluster by z=0. Utilizing multiwavelength data, we derive the physical
properties of these [O III] emitters and find they are medium mass normal
star-forming galaxies ($\sim10^{10}$M$_\odot$) roughly following the
star-forming main sequence. The [O III] emitters trace an overdensity spatially
offset from that of photometric-redshift and quiescent galaxies, suggesting
these distinct galaxy populations may inhabit dark matter halos that formed at
different epochs. A comparative analysis of [O III] emitter properties shows
similar characteristics in both protocluster and field environments. This
protocluster likely represents an evolved structure that has progressed beyond
its peak star-formation phase, although our limited sample size may prevent
detection of subtle environmental effects.

Abstract: A star's ability to explode in a core-collapse supernova is correlated with
its density profile, $\rho(r)$, such that compact stars with shallow density
profiles preferentially ``fail'' and produce black holes. This correlation can
be understood from a mass perspective, as shallower density profiles enclose
$\sim 3M_{\odot}$ (i.e., the maximum neutron-star mass) at relatively small
radii, but could also be due to the fact that a shockwave (driving the
explosion) inevitably stalls if the density profile into which it propagates is
shallower than $\rho(r) \propto r^{-2}$. Here we show that this condition --
the density profile being steeper than $\rho \propto r^{-2}$ -- is necessary,
but not sufficient, for generating a strong explosion. In particular, we find
solutions to the fluid equations that describe a shockwave propagating at a
fixed fraction of the local freefall speed into a temporally evolving,
infalling medium, the density profile of which scales as $\rho \propto r^{-n}$
at large radii. The speed of the shock diverges as $n\rightarrow 2$ and
declines (eventually to below the Keplerian escape speed) as $n$ increases,
while the total energy contained in the explosion approaches zero as the shock
recedes to large distances. These solutions therefore represent fluid-dynamical
analogs of marginally bound orbits, and yield the ``shock escape speed'' as a
function of the density profile. We also suggest that stellar explodability is
correlated with the power-law index of the density at $\sim10^9$ cm, where the
neutrino diffusion time equals the local dynamical time for most massive stars,
which agrees with supernova simulations.

relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations of core-collapse
supernovae (CCSNe) for a progenitor of zero-age-main-sequence (ZAMS) mass $25\,
M_\odot$. We simulate a total of 12 models for simulation times in the range
$190-260\, \mathrm{ms}$ to systematically study the effect of rotation rates
and magnetic fields on jet formation via the magnetorotational mechanism. We
have performed simulations on OLCF's Frontier using the new GPU-accelerated
dynamical-spacetime GRMHD code \theCode for magnetic fields $B_0 = (10^{11},
10^{12})\, \mathrm{G}$ and rotation rates $\Omega_0 = (0.14, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5,
2.0, 2.5)\, \mathrm{rad/s}$. We always resolve the entire region containing the
shock with a resolution of at least $1.48\, \mathrm{km}$. We find that models
with $B_0=10^{11}\, \mathrm{G}$ fail to explode, while those with
$B_0=10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$ show a wide range of jet morphologies and explosive
outcomes depending on the rotation rate. Models with $B_0=10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$
and $\Omega_0=(1.0,1.5)\, \mathrm{rad/s}$ form jets that bend sideways, giving
the ejecta a more spherical character, and possibly representing explosions
that \textit{appear} neutrino-driven even though they are
magnetorotationally-driven. Models with $B_0=10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$ and
$\Omega_0\geq2.0\, \mathrm{rad/s}$ show ejecta velocities $\gtrsim15000\,
\mathrm{km/s}$, making them suitable candidates for broad-lined type Ic
supernova progenitors. This work represents the largest set of 3D
general-relativistic GRMHD simulations studying magnetorotational supernovae in
full GR and demonstrates the potential of systematic studies with
GPU-accelerated 3D simulations of CCSNe.

their origin, revealing a direct connection with solar variability. Thanks to
their intrinsic very low noise level, the Auger scalers allow a thorough and
detailed investigation of the galactic cosmic-ray flux variations in the

Method: 通过计算密度增强因子、宇宙射线通量及其抑制，并与观测数据进行比较，采用χ²和χ²_red分析通量，Levenberg-Marquardt算法分析抑制，同时研究了宇宙射线到达方向的各向异性。

Result: 结果表明，Bumblebee引力参数增加会增强密度因子，特别是在低能量下；大源间距值会放大与ΛCDM模型的偏差，活动星系核在高能量下占主导，而伽马射线暴/恒星形成率在低能量下占主导；天空图显示了在大源间距下的结构化通量模式和高能量下的结构化各向异性。

Abstract: We explore the effects of Bumblebee gravity on the propagation of ultra-high
energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) using astrophysical sources modeled in the
Unger-Farrar-Anchordoqui (UFA) framework (2015), which includes star formation
rate (SFR), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and active galactic nuclei (AGN). We
compute the density enhancement factor for various source separation distances
($d_\text{s}$s) up to 100 Mpc within the Bumblebee gravity scenario.
Additionally, we calculate the CRs flux and their suppression, comparing the
results with observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) and the
Telescope Array through $\chi^2$ and $\chi_\text{red}^2$ analysis for the flux
and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for suppression. The anisotropy in CRs
arrival directions is examined, with corresponding $\chi^2$ and
$\chi_\text{red}^2$ values obtained from the PAO surface detector data (SD 750
and SD 1500). Finally, we present skymaps of flux and anisotropy under
different model assumptions, providing insights into the observational
signatures of UHECRs in Bumblebee gravity. Our results show that increasing the
Bumblebee gravity parameter $l$ enhances the density factor $\xi$, particularly
at low energies, highlighting Lorentz violation's impact on CRs' propagation.
Larger $d_\text{s}$ values amplify deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model, with
AGN sources dominating at high energies and GRB/SFR sources at lower energies.
The skymaps indicate the structured flux patterns at large $d_\text{s}$ and
structured anisotropy at higher energies.

### [26] [Constraining the initial Lorentz factor of gamma-ray bursts under different circumburst mediums](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11743)
*Sheng-Jin Sun,Shuang-Xi Yi,Yuan-Chuan Zou,Yu-Peng Yang,Ying Qin,Qing-Wen Tang,Fa-Yin Wang*

TL;DR: 本研究通过分析33个伽马射线暴（GRBs）的减速时间，推导了初始洛伦兹因子（Γ₀），并发现其与各向同性能量（Eγ,iso）和平均各向同性光度（Lγ,iso）之间存在紧密相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  
Background: 初始洛伦兹因子（Γ₀）对揭示伽马射线暴（GRBs）的物理特性至关重要。以往研究表明，GRBs的环境介质密度指数k在0-2之间，而非严格等于0（均匀星际介质）或2（典型恒星风）。

Data: 本研究选取了33个GRBs，包括7个X射线GRBs和26个光学GRBs。

Method: 通过利用火球的减速时间（tₚ），假设辐射效率η=0.2，推导了33个GRBs的初始洛伦兹因子（Γ₀）。

Result: 推导的初始洛伦兹因子范围为50-500，与先前研究一致。此外，发现Γ₀与Eγ,iso和Lγ,iso之间存在紧密相关性，并验证了Γ₀、Eγ,iso（或Lγ,iso）与峰值能量Ep,z之间的相关性。

Abstract: The initial Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_{\text{0}}$) plays a crucial role in
uncovering the physical characteristics of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Previous
studies have indicated that the ambient medium density index $k$ for GRBs falls
in the range of 0 - 2, rather than exactly equal to 0 (homogeneous interstellar
ambient) or 2 (typical stellar wind). In this work, we aim to constrain the
$\Gamma_0$ of GRBs considering their distinct circumburst medium. We select a
total of 33 GRBs for our analysis, comprising 7 X-ray GRBs and 26 optical GRBs.
Subsequently, by utilizing the deceleration time of fireball $t_{\rm p}$, we
derive the $\Gamma_0$ for the 33 GRBs assuming the radiation efficiency of
$\eta =$ 0.2. The inferred initial Lorentz factor was found to be from 50 to
500, consistent with previous studies. We then investigate the correlation
between the $\Gamma_0$ and the isotropic energy $E_{\rm \gamma,iso}$ (as well
as the mean isotropic luminosity $L_{\rm \gamma,iso}$), finding very tight
correlations between them, i.e., $\Gamma_0$ $\propto$ $E^{0.24}_{\rm
\gamma,iso,52}$ ($\Gamma_0$ $\propto$ $L^{0.20}_{\rm \gamma,iso.49}$) with
$\eta$=0.2. Additionally, we verify the correlation among $\Gamma_0$, the
isotropic energy $E_{\rm \gamma,iso}$ (or $L_{\rm \gamma,iso}$) and the peak
energy $E_{\rm{p,z}}$, i.e., $E_{\rm \gamma,iso,52}$ $\propto$
$\Gamma^{1.36}_0$$E^{0.82}_{\rm{p,z}}$ ($L_{\rm \gamma,iso,49}$ $\propto$
$\Gamma^{1.05}_0$$E^{0.66}_{\rm{p,z}}$) under the same radiation efficiency
($\eta$=0.2).

Result: 发现遗迹呈环状形态，偏振显著，磁场强度约11μG，并识别出可能的HI云和风泡空腔。

Abstract: We present a new radio continuum study of the Large Magellanic Cloud
supernova remnant (SNR) MC SNR J0519-6902. With a diameter of ~8 pc, this SNR
shows a radio ring-like morphology with three bright regions toward the north,
east, and south. Its linear polarisation is prominent with average values of 5
+- 1% and 6 +- 1% at 5500 and 9000 MHz, and we find a spectral index of -0.62
+- 0.02 , typical of a young SNR. The average rotation measure is estimated at
-124 +- 83 rad m-2 and the magnetic field strength at ~11 muG. We also estimate
an equipartition magnetic field of 72 +- 5 muG and minimum explosion energy of
Emin = 2.6x1048 erg. Finally, we identified an H I cloud that may be associated
with MC SNR J0519-6902, located in the southeastern part of the remnant, along
with a potential wind-bubble cavity.

Background: Z源喷流的形成和起源尚不明确，尽管已观测到X射线与射电的相关性。

Data: 使用了Rossi X-ray Timing Experiment Satellite对Sco X-1的17次观测数据。

Method: 通过交叉相关函数（CCF）分析和功率密度谱（PDS）研究X射线数据。

Result: 发现5次观测中X射线滞后现象与超相对论性喷流相关，推测喷流扰动了内吸积区域；其余观测显示稳定的吸积流特征。内吸积区域大小被限制在20-30公里。

Abstract: The formation and origin of Jets from Z sources are not well understood,
although an X-ray-radio correlation has been observed. We analyzed a few
observations of Sco X-1 using the Rossi X-ray Timing Experiment Satellite. Out
of the 17 observations, 5 showed lags of a few 10s of seconds with an asymmetry
in the CCF between the soft and hard bands in their cross-correlation function
(CCF) analysis. Interestingly, during these observations, a ballistic-type
radio jet of Ultra-relativistic(UR) nature was reported. The observed lags and
associated cross-correlation coefficients were validated using simulations. The
rest of the 12 observations' CCFs were symmetric, and their associated Power
Density Spectrum (PDS) displayed Normal Branch(NBO)/Normal + Horizontal Branch
Oscillations(NBO+HBO). The X-ray spectral study of 2 obs. where radio core
emission was seen with abrupt variation in both PDS and CCF showed a black-body
flux variation of 10-20%, but no spectral parameter varied. We suggest that the
ballistic jet caused a disturbance in the inner accretion region, viz., the
Boundary Layer plausibly along with the Corona, that caused the lags observed
in the CCFs along with the absence of any oscillatory features in the PDS
tracing only a flat-topped noise. Whereas the regions with no lags showed a
persistent NBO/NBO+HBO feature, suggesting a steady accretion flow. Although
the UR jet can't be related to NBO or HBO, we suggest it could be related to
the phenomena that cause NBO since the majority of PDSs displayed NBO. We also
constrain the inner accretion region size to 20-30 km, which is responsible for
the accretion ejecta in Sco X-1.

Result: 研究发现不仅缓解了μ子信号不足的问题，还揭示了所有当前强子相互作用模型预测的簇射最大深度过浅，为模型缺陷提供了新视角。

Abstract: The combination of fluorescence and surface detectors at the Pierre Auger
Observatory offers unprecedented precision in testing models of hadronic
interactions at center-of-mass energies around 70 TeV and beyond. However, for
some time, discrepancies between model predictions and measured air-shower data
have complicated efforts to accurately determine the mass composition of
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. A key inconsistency is the deficit of simulated
signals compared to those measured with the surface detectors, typically
interpreted as a deficit in the muon signal generated by the hadronic component
of simulated showers.
  Recently, a new global method has been applied to the combined data from the
surface and fluorescence detectors at the Pierre Auger Observatory. This method
simultaneously determines the mass composition of cosmic rays and evaluates
variations in the simulated depth of the shower maximum and hadronic signals on
the ground. The findings reveal not only the alleviated muon problem but also
show that all current models of hadronic interactions predict depths of the
shower maximum that are too shallow, offering new insights into deficiencies in
these models from a broader perspective.

Background: 近期高分辨率观测确立了黑洞喷流与吸积盘结构之间的强关联，特别是在3.5毫米波段。

Data: 使用了3.5毫米波段的观测数据。

Method: 提出了“喷流修正的Novikov-Thorne盘模型”，将喷流亮度纳入吸积盘辐射框架，并整合了喷流中相对论性电子的同步辐射。

Result: 修正模型显示喷流贡献使总吸积盘亮度增加约33.5%，且喷流效应在不同观测倾角下均显著。

Abstract: Recent high-resolution observations have established a strong link between
black hole jets and accretion disk structures, particularly in the 3.5 mm
wavelength band [Nature. 616, 686 (2023)]. In this work, we propose a
``jet-modified Novikov-Thorne disk model'' that explicitly incorporates jet
luminosity into the accretion disk radiation framework. By integrating
synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons in the jet, we derive a
modified luminosity function that accounts for both the accretion disk and jet
contributions. Our analysis demonstrates that the inclusion of jet luminosity
enhances the total accretion disk luminosity by approximately 33.5\%, as
derived from the integration of radiative flux. Furthermore, we compare our
modified model with the standard Novikov-Thorne model and find that the jet
contribution remains significant across different observational inclinations.
These results highlight the necessity of incorporating jet effects when
estimating the observable flux of black hole accretion systems, which has
direct implications for future astronomical observations.

Abstract: Relativistic jets from supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei are
amongst the most powerful phenomena in the universe, acting to regulate the
growth of massive galaxies. Similar jets from stellar-mass black holes offer a
chance to study the same phenomena on accessible observation time scales.
However, such comparative studies across black hole masses and time scales
remain hampered by the long-standing perception that stellar-mass black hole
jets are in a less relativistic regime. We used radio interferometry
observations to monitor the Galactic black hole X-ray binary 4U 1543-47 and
discovered two distinct, relativistic ejections launched during a single
outburst. Our measurements reveal a likely Lorentz factor of $\sim$ 8 and a
minimum of 4.6 at launch with 95% confidence, demonstrating that stellar-mass
black holes in X-ray binaries can launch jets as relativistic as those seen in
active galactic nuclei.

Background: 超高能宇宙射线的质量组成是宇宙粒子物理学中的一个未解问题，通常通过宇宙射线簇射的最大深度（Xmax）来推断，但现代强子相互作用模型对此的确定存在模糊性。

Data: 使用了皮埃尔·奥格天文台的宇宙射线数据。

Method: 采用数据驱动的方法，将Xmax的期望值视为自由参数，并假设宇宙射线在最高能量下主要由高金属性（如纯铁核）组成。

Result: 研究发现，若将现代强子相互作用模型中的Xmax期望值调整为较大值，皮埃尔·奥格天文台的数据可以得到一致解释。

Abstract: The mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays is an open problem in
astroparticle physics. It is usually inferred from the depth of the shower
maximum (Xmax) of cosmic-ray showers, which is only ambiguously determined by
modern hadronic interaction models. We examine a data-driven scenario, in which
we consider the expectation value of Xmax as a free parameter. We test the
novel hypothesis whether the cosmic-ray data from the Pierre Auger Observatory
can be interpreted in a consistent picture, under the assumption that the mass
composition of cosmic rays at the highest energies is dominated by high
metallicity, resulting in pure iron nuclei at energies above ~40 EeV. We
investigate the implications on astrophysical observations and hadronic
interactions, and we discuss the global consistency of the data assuming this
heavy-metal scenario. We conclude that the data from the Pierre Auger
Observatory can be interpreted consistently if the expectation values for Xmax
from modern hadronic interaction models are shifted to larger values.

Abstract: Observations have established that coherent radio emission from pulsars arise
at few hundred kilometers above stellar surface. Recent polarization studies
have further demonstrated that plasma instabilities are necessary for charge
bunching that gives rise to coherent emission. The formation of charged
solitons in the electron-positron plasma is the only known bunching mechanism
that can be realised at these heights. More than five decades of observations
have revealed a number of emission features that should emerge from any valid
radio emission mechanism. We have carried out numerical calculations to find
the features of average emission from curvature radiation due to charged
solitons. The characteristic curvature radiation spectrum has been updated from
the well known one-dimensional dependence into a general two-dimensional form,
and contribution from each soliton along observer's line of sight (LOS) has
been added to reproduce the pulsar emission. The outflowing plasma is formed by
sparking discharges above the stellar surface that are located within
concentric rings resembling the core-cone emission beam, and uniform
distribution of solitons along any LOS has been assumed. The observed effects
of radius to frequency mapping, where the lower frequency emission originates
from higher altitudes, is seen in this setup. The power law spectrum and
relative steepening of the core spectra with respect to the cones also emerges.
The estimated polarization position angle reflects the geometrical
configuration of pulsars as expected. These studies demonstrate the efficacy of
coherent curvature radiation from charged solitons to reproduce the average
observational features of pulsars.

Abstract: Observations of several gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) that are temporally and
spatially compatible with energetic supernovae (hypernovae) has established
their common origin. In one case (GRB 111209A/SN 2011kl) the associated
supernova was classified as superluminous (SN 2011kl). The exceptional duration
of the observed gamma-ray prompt emission of GRB 111209A (about 7 hours) is
widely considered key to unlocking the physics behind the still mysterious
origin of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). We review the main observational
and theoretical findings that may link some ultra-long GRBs to SLSNe.
Specifically, we examine notable events, the role of progenitors and host
galaxies in shaping these phenomena, and focus on the proposed models. While a
magnetar central engine is a plausible mechanism for both luminous and
long-duration GRBs, a conclusive answer remains elusive, as alternative
explanations are still viable. Further observational and theoretical work is
required to clarify progenitor pathways and explosion mechanisms, potentially
extending the classical GRB-SN connection to rare superluminous hypernovae.

Result: 研究发现体黏性阻尼随温度升高而增强，可完全抑制成分g模，而f模几乎不受影响。动态声速成为描述耗散中子星物质振荡特性的有效工具。

Abstract: We investigate the impact of chemical equilibration and the resulting bulk
viscosity on non-radial oscillation modes of warm neutron stars at temperatures
up to T~5 MeV, relevant for protoneutron stars and neutron-star post-merger
remnants. In this regime, the relaxation rate of weak interactions becomes
comparable to the characteristic frequencies of composition g-modes in the
core, resulting in resonant damping. To capture this effect, we introduce the
dynamic sound speed, a complex, frequency-dependent generalization of the
adiabatic sound speed that encodes both the restoring force and the dissipative
effects of bulk compression. Using realistic weak reaction rates and three
representative equations of state, we compute the complex frequencies of
composition g-modes with finite-temperature profiles. We find that bulk viscous
damping becomes increasingly significant with temperature and can completely
suppress composition g-modes. In contrast, the f-mode remains largely
unaffected by bulk viscosity due to its nearly divergence-free character. Our
results highlight the sensitivity of g-mode behavior to thermal structure, weak
reaction rates, and the equation of state, and establish the dynamic sound
speed as a valuable descriptor characterizing oscillation properties in
dissipative neutron star matter.

Result: 没有显著证据支持新的余辉成分，喷流仍处于轻度相对论阶段，光变曲线下降比标准模型预期更平缓，可能源于晚期能量注入或微观物理参数的依赖性。

Abstract: GW170817 is the first binary neutron star merger detected with gravitational
and electromagnetic waves, and its afterglow is still detectable 7 years
post-merger. Some previous studies of the X-ray afterglow have claimed the
onset of a new afterglow component or raised concerns about the data processing
techniques. Motivated thus, we present here a reanalysis of X-ray afterglow
data for GW170817 and find potential sources of discrepancies between the data
reduction techniques employed by various research groups. We also analyze the
updated panchromatic afterglow data to find that there is no significant
evidence for any new afterglow component (e.g. due to the ejecta that gave rise
to the kilonova) and that the jet must be still in a mildly relativistic phase.
The decline in the afterglow light curve is significantly shallower compared to
that expected from the standard synchrotron afterglow jet models with sideways
spreading, indicating either an additional energy injection at late times or
the velocity dependence on the microphysics parameters. In this context, we
discuss the implications of the late time afterglow data on jet dynamics.

Reionization On Computers" (CROC) and ``Thesan". Synthetic spectra in both
simulations have statistics of dark gaps similar to observations, but do not
exhibit the damping wing features. Moreover, a toy model with neutral islands
added ``by hand" only reproduces the observational results when the fraction of
neutral islands among all dark gaps exceeds 90%. I.e., simulations and
observations appear to produce two distinct ``populations" of dark gaps. In
addition, the neutral islands observed at $z=5.9$ should be short-lived and
hence cannot extend to $z<5.5$. In summary, the observational detections of
damping wing features present serious challenges not only to state-of-the-art
simulations but also to our general understanding of how reionization should
proceed.

Abstract: Recent discoveries of primordial black hole (PBH) candidates by means of high
cadence microlensing open the way to a physical understanding of the formation
of dark matter as a chapter in the thermal history of the Universe. Two
complementary sites of PBH formation are considered, inflation and the early
Universe at TeV to MeV energies. In the latter case the Friedman equation,
together with the measurement of the mass of the PBH, reveal the threshold
energy, the mass spectrum and the likely end point of this epoch. Some of the
many recent exoplanet detections may conceivably have been detections of PBHs.
When the Universe cools to MeV temperatures, larger mass PBH would form
similarly, reaching the supermassive regime. The discovery of numerous
supermassive black holes (SMBH) at high redshift with JWST fulfils this
expectation. We corroborate the idea that Planck mass relics could be an
important component of dark matter, and find that these are formed by PBH with
initial mass less than approximately 6 x 10^{-16} M{_\odot} and cosmic
temperature above 10^9 GeV. Although in some mass ranges PBH can only make up a
modest fraction of {\Omega}matter, it is possible that all astrophysical dark
matter, as distinct from axions and WIMPs, is of PBH origin.

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种方法（高斯过程模拟器和混合有效场论）用于在N体模拟中快速准确地重建SZ效应的重子性质，并比较了它们的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  
Background: 研究背景涉及利用SZ效应分析重子反馈时，需要快速准确的重建方法，但目前存在挑战。

Data: 使用了MillenniumTNG套件中的光学深度和Compton-y场数据。

Method: 第一种方法采用高斯过程模拟器通过传递函数建模SZ量，第二种方法使用混合有效场论（HEFT）在模拟中重现这些量。

Result: 结果表明，传递函数方法对初始高相关性场（如光学深度与暗物质场）重建更准确，而HEFT方法对初始弱相关性场（如Compton-y与暗物质场）更有效。

Abstract: We present two approaches for "painting" baryonic properties relevant to the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect - optical depth and Compton-$y$ - onto
3-dimensional $N$-body simulations, using the MillenniumTNG suite as a
benchmark. The goal of these methods is to produce fast and accurate
reconstruction methods to aid future analyses of baryonic feedback using the SZ
effect. The first approach employs a Gaussian Process emulator to model the SZ
quantities via a transfer function, while the second utilizes Hybrid Effective
Field Theory (HEFT) to reproduce these quantities within the simulation. Our
analysis involves comparing both methods to the true MillenniumTNG optical
depth and Compton-$y$ fields using several metrics, including the
cross-correlation coefficient, power spectrum, and power spectrum error.
Additionally, we assess how well the reconstructed fields correlate with dark
matter haloes across various mass thresholds. The results indicate that the
transfer function method yields more accurate reconstructions for fields with
initially high correlations ($r \approx 1$), such as between the optical depth
and dark matter fields. Conversely, the HEFT-based approach proves more
effective in enhancing correlations for fields with weaker initial correlations
($r \sim 0.5$), such as between the Compton-$y$ and dark matter fields. Lastly,
we discuss extensions of our methods to improve the reconstruction performance
at the field level.

Background: 天体物理图中的辐射源分离（component separation）是提取一个或多个发射源的过程，对当前和未来实验中的CMB精确清洁至关重要。

Data: 使用了真实的温度和极化模拟数据。

Method: 基于神经网络的新方法。

Result: 温度残差为$20 \pm \mu K^{2}$；极化分析中，$E$和$B$模式的残差分别为$10^{-2} \mu K^{2}$（$l>200$）和$10^{-3} \mu K^{2}$。

Abstract: Component separation is the process of extracting one or more emission
sources in astrophysical maps. It is therefore crucial to develop models that
can accurately clean the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in current and
future experiments. In this work, we present a new methodology based on neural
networks which operates on realistic temperature and polarization simulations.
We assess its performance by comparing the power spectra of the output maps
with those of the input maps and other emissions. For temperature, we obtain
residuals of $20 \pm \mu K^{2}$. For polarization, we analyze the $E$ and $B$
modes, which are related to density (scalar) and primordial gravitational waves
(tensorial) perturbations occurring in the first second of the Universe,
obtaining residuals of $10^{-2} \mu K^{2}$ at $l>200$ and $10^{-2}$ and
$10^{-3} \mu K^{2}$ for $E$ and $B$, respectively.

Result: 发现分离宇宙方法在波长大于多个下限（取决于宇宙视界和场有效哈密顿质量的倒数）时能有效描述宇宙扰动理论，并验证了均匀膨胀规范在随机暴胀中的适用性。

Abstract: In this article we extend a study of the validity conditions of the
separate-universe approach of cosmological perturbations to models of inflation
with multiple fields. The separate-universe approach consists in describing the
universe as a collection of homogeneous and isotropic patches, giving us an
effective description of perturbation theory at large scales through
phase-space reduction. This approximation is a necessary step in stochastic
inflation, an effective theory of coarse-grained, super-Hubble, scalar fields
fluctuations. One needs a stochastic inflation description in the context of
primordial black hole productions since it needs enhancements of the curvature
power spectrum. It easily achievable in multifield inflation models but
necessarily comes with strong diffusive effects. We study and compare
cosmological perturbation theory and the separate-universe approach in said
non-linear sigma models as a typical framework of multifield inflation and
employing the Hamiltonian formalism to keep track of the complete phase space
(or the reduced isotropic phase space in the separate-universe approach). We
find that the separate-universe approach adequately describes the cosmological
perturbation theory provided the wavelength of the modes considered is greater
that several lower bounds that depend on the cosmological horizon and the
inverse of the effective Hamiltonian masses of the fields; the latter being
fixed by the coupling potential and the field-space geometry. We also compare
gauge-invariant variables and several gauge fixing procedures in both
approaches. For instance, we showed that the uniform-expansion gauge is nicely
described by the separate-universe picture, hence qualifying its use in
stochastic inflation as commonly done.

Result: 发现非冷暗物质的微弱偏好无法被排除，某些数据集在95%置信水平上显著支持相互作用的存在，且幻影暗能量可能缓解$S_8$张力。

Abstract: A pressureless dark matter component fits well with several cosmological
observations. However, there are indications that cold dark matter may
encounter challenges in explaining observations at small scales, particularly
at galactic scales. Observational data suggest that dark matter models
incorporating a pressure component could provide solutions to these small-scale
problems. In this work, we investigate the possibility that present-day dark
matter may result from a decaying non-cold dark matter sector transitioning
into the dark energy sector. As the sensitivity of astronomical surveys rapidly
increases, we explore an interacting scenario between dark energy and non-cold
dark matter, where dark energy has a constant equation of state ($w_{\rm de}$),
and dark matter, being non-cold, also has a constant (non-zero) equation of
state ($w_{\rm dm}$). Considering the phantom and quintessence nature of dark
energy, characterized by its equation of state, we separately analyze
interacting phantom and interacting quintessence scenarios. We constrain these
scenarios using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements and their
combination with external probes, such as DESI-BAO and PantheonPlus. From our
analyses, we find that a very mild preference for non-cold dark matter cannot
be excluded based on the employed datasets. Additionally, for some datasets,
there is a pronounced preference for the presence of an interaction at more
than 95\% confidence level (CL). Moreover, when the dark energy equation of
state lies in the phantom regime, the $S_8$ tension can be alleviated. This
study suggests that cosmological models incorporating a non-cold dark matter
component should be considered as viable scenarios with novel phenomenological
implications, as reflected in the present work.

Abstract: We provide a systematic study of the Starobinsky-Higgs inflation model in the
presence of an additional cubic term of the Ricci scalar. We investigate, in
particular, the effects of the cubic term on the spectral index $n_s$ and the

show that the $R^3$-corrected Starobinsky-Higgs model can achieve compatibility
with cosmic microwave background observations while producing distinct
observational signatures with different frequency ranges. In addition, we
discuss the complementarity between different observational probes, including
the scalar-induced gravitational waves and spectral distortions, offering an
independent probe of the enhanced curvature perturbations. Detection prospects
are also discussed.

TL;DR: Primordial black holes (PBHs) catalyze first-order phase transitions (FOPTs), altering gravitational wave signals and impacting dark matter interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  
Background: Primordial black holes (PBHs) can catalyze first-order phase transitions (FOPTs), potentially modifying gravitational wave (GW) signals, but the effect in high PBH density regimes is unexplored.

Data: NANOGrav 15-year dataset.

Method: Analytical model with envelope approximation and bulk flow model; analysis of scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs).

Result: PBHs amplify GW signals at low densities but suppress them at high densities; asteroid-mass PBHs as dark matter are incompatible with PT interpretations unless SIGWs are considered.

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) can catalyze first-order phase transitions
(FOPTs) in their vicinity, potentially modifying the gravitational wave (GW)
signals from PTs. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of
this catalytic effect during supercooled PTs within the high PBH number density
regime. Applying the analytical model with envelope approximation, we derive
the general expressions of GW spectrum in the presence of PBHs. We find that at
relatively small PBH number densities, the GW signals are amplified due to the
large-size bubbles. While higher PBH number densities suppress GW signals,
since the accelerated PT progresses too rapidly. We further extend our findings
to the bulk flow model and to scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs) generated during PTs.
By conducting data fitting with the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we find that the
PBH catalytic effect significantly alters the estimation of PT parameters.
Notably, our analysis of the bubble collision GWs reveals that, the
asteroid-mass PBHs ($10^{-16} - 10^{-12} M_\odot$) as the whole dark matter is
incompatible with the PT interpretation of pulsar timing array signals.
However, incorporating SIGWs can reduce this incompatibility for PBHs in the
mass range $10^{-14} - 10^{-12} M_\odot$.

Result: 研究发现小尺度上曲率扰动增强，可能形成原始黑洞和引力波背景，其红外频率标度为f²，与NANOGrav数据一致，并可能被LISA和ET探测到。

Abstract: Non-singular matter bouncing cosmological setups are of particular interest
since apart from adressing the initial singularity problem they can give rise
as well to a nearly scale-invariant curvature power spectrum on scales
$k<10^{4}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, favored by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
experiments. Interestingly enough, one can find that within such non-singular
bouncing cosmological setups, curvature perturbations grow on super-horizon
scales during the matter contracting phase. In this work, we account for the
evolution of cosmological perturbations during the transition to the Hot Big
Bang expanding Universe, finding at the end naturally enhanced curvature
perturbations on very small scales at horizon-crossing time during the
expanding phase. These enhanced cosmological perturbations can induce
gravitational waves (GWs) due to second order gravitational interactions and
collapse as well to form primordial black holes (PBHs), with the latter acting
as one of the most viable dark matter candidates. Remarkably, we find an
induced GW background with a universal infrared (IR) frequency scaling of
$f^2$, in excellent agreement with the recently released $\mathrm{nHz}$ GW data
by the NANOGrav collaboration, being potentially detectable as well by other GW
observatories such as LISA and ET, depending on the values of the bouncing
cosmological parameters at hand.

Method: 基于Weyl张量和Bel-Robinson张量的熵估计器分析方法。

Result: 研究表明，两种熵估计器在可逆和不可逆过程中均满足热力学第二定律。

Abstract: There are several reasons to support the idea that entropy might be
associated to gravity itself. In the absence of a quantum theory of gravity,
classical estimators for the gravitational entropy have been proposed. Any
viable description of the gravitational entropy should reproduce the
Hawking-Bekenstein entropy at the event horizon of black holes. Furthermore, in
any black hole transformation, these estimators must satisfy the second law of
black hole thermodynamics. In this work, we analyze whether two entropy
estimators, one based on the Weyl tensor and the other on the Bel-Robinson
tensor, satisfy the second law in the transformation process from a
Schwarzschild to a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole by the absorption of a
charge test particle. We also address the inverse process. We show that
depending whether the process is reversible or not, both estimators fulfill the
second law.

Abstract: We present a numerical investigation of primordial black hole (PBH) formation
from super-horizon curvature perturbations and the subsequent generation and
propagation of sound waves, which can serve as a new source of stochastic
gravitational wave backgrounds presented in a companion letter. Using the
Misner-Sharp formalism with an excision technique, our simulations extend to
significantly later times than previous work and indicate that the
near-critical perturbations produce a distinct compression wave featuring both
overdense and underdense shells, while significantly supercritical
perturbations yield only an underdense shell. We also show that a softer
equation of state suppresses the formation of compression waves. Furthermore,
the comoving thickness of sound shells remains nearly constant during
propagation and scales with the Hubble radius at horizon re-entry, thereby
serving as a key link between the gravitational-wave peak frequency and PBH
mass in the companion letter. These results offer new insights into the
dynamics of PBH formation and suggest potential observational signatures of
PBHs in the gravitational wave spectrum from associated sound waves.

Abstract: Studying the anharmonicity in the infrared (IR) spectra of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at elevated temperatures is important to
understand vibrational features and chemical properties of interstellar dust,
especially in the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) era. We take pyrene as an
example PAH and investigate how different degrees of superhydrogenation affects
the applicability of the harmonic approximation and the role of temperature in
IR spectra of PAHs. This is achieved by comparing theoretical IR spectra
generated by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental IR
spectra obtained via gas-phase action spectroscopy which utilizes the Infrared
Multiple Photon Dissociation (IRMPD). All simulations are accelerated by a
machine learning interatomic potential, in order to reach first principle
accuracies while keeping low computational costs. We have found that the
harmonic approximation with empirical scaling factors is able to reproduce
experimental band profile of pristine and partially superhydrogenated pyrene
cations. However, a MD-based anharmonic treatment is mandatory in the case of
fully superhydrogenated pyrene cation for matching theory and experiment. In
addition, band shifts and broadenings as the temperature increases are
investigated in detail. Those findings may aid in the interpretation of JWST
observations on the variations in band positions and widths of interstellar
dust.

Background: 行星形成的起始时间是一个基本问题，目前对原行星盘在早期演化阶段中子结构的形成机制了解有限。

Data: 研究结合了CAMPOS样本和文献中观测到的Class 0-II原行星盘数据，所有数据在1.3毫米波长下以4至33 au的分辨率成像。

Method: 通过限制样本的观测条件（如倾角、分辨率等），并考虑消光校正和赫歇尔太空望远镜数据的影响，分析了子结构检测率与辐射温度的关系。

Result: 研究发现子结构检测率在辐射温度为200-400 K时显著增加，且Class 0盘中未检测到子结构；子结构的出现可能与光学深度增加有关，且与演化阶段无关。

Abstract: The 1.3 mm CAMPOS survey has resolved 90 protostellar disks with $\sim$15 au
resolution across the Ophiuchus, Corona Australis, and Chamaeleon star-forming
regions. To address the fundamental question, "When does planet formation
begin?", we combined the CAMPOS sample with literature observations of Class
0-II disks (bolometric temperature, $T_{\rm bol} \le 1900$ K), all mapped at
1.3 mm with resolutions ranging from 4 to 33 au. To investigate substructure
detection rates as a function of bolometric temperature, we restricted the
sample to disks observed at the 1.3 mm wavelength, with inclinations below
75$^\circ$, linear resolution $\le 20$ au and resolved with at least four
resolution elements ($\theta_{\rm disk}/\theta_{\rm res} \ge 4$). We also
considered the effects of extinction correction and the inclusion of Herschel
Space Telescope data on the bolometric temperature measurements, to constrain
the lower and upper limits of bolometric temperature for each source. We find
that by $T_{\rm bol} \sim 200-400\,K$, substructure detection rates increased
sharply to $\sim$60%, corresponding to an approximate age of $0.2-0.4$ Myr. No
substructures are detected in Class 0 disks. The ratio of disk-averaged
brightness temperature to predicted dust temperature shows a trend of
increasing values toward the youngest Class 0 disks, suggesting higher optical
depths in these early stages. Classifying disks with substructures into those
with and without large central cavities, we find both populations coexisting
across evolutionary stages, suggesting they are not necessarily evolutionarily
linked. Our statistical analysis confirms that substructures similar to those
in Class II disks are already common by the Class I stage, and the emergence of
these structures at $T_{\rm bol} \sim 200-400\,K$ could represent only an upper
limit.

Method: NIRCam coronagraphic imaging survey of 9 nearby young low-mass stars at 3-5 micron wavelengths.

Result: Identified two marginal point source candidates consistent with sub-Jupiter mass exoplanets and set occurrence constraints (<0.10 and <0.16 objects per star at 1 and 3-sigma confidence).

Abstract: The population of giant planets on wide orbits around low-mass M dwarf stars
is poorly understood, but the unprecedented sensitivity of JWST NIRCam
coronagraphic imaging now provides direct access to planets significantly less
massive than Jupiter beyond 10 AU around the closest, youngest M dwarfs. We
present the design, observations, and results of JWST GTO Program 1184, a Cycle
1 NIRCam coronagraphic imaging survey of 9 very nearby and young low-mass stars
at 3-5 micron wavelengths. In the F356W and F444W filters, we achieve survey
median 5-sigma contrasts deeper than 10-5 at a separation of 1", corresponding
to 0.20 MJup in F444W and 1.30 MJup in F356W at planet-star separations of 10
AU. Our results include 3-5 micron debris disk detections and the
identification of many extended and point-like sources in the final
post-processed images. In particular, we have identified two marginal point
source candidates having fluxes and color limits consistent with model
predictions for young sub-Jupiter mass exoplanets. Under the assumption that
neither candidate is confirmed, we place the first direct-imaging occurrence
constraints on M dwarf wide-orbit (semimajor axes 10-100 AU), sub-Jupiter mass
exoplanets (0.3-1 MJup). We find frequency limits of < 0.10 and < 0.16 objects
per star with 1 and 3-sigma confidence, respectively. This survey brings to the
forefront the unprecedented capabilities of JWST NIRCam coronagraphic imaging
when targeting young, low-mass stars and acts as a precursor to broader surveys
to place deep statistical constraints on wide-orbit, sub-Jupiter mass planets
around M dwarfs.

Abstract: We present medium-wave ($\sim$0.5~$\mu$m to $\sim$13~$\mu$m) radiative flux
distributions and spectra derived from high-resolution atmospheric dynamics
simulations of an exoplanet \WASPP. This planet serves to illustrate several
important features. Assuming different chemical compositions for its atmosphere
(e.g., H$_2$/He only and $Z \in \{1, 12\}$ times solar metallicity), the
outgoing radiative flux is computed using full radiative transfer that folds in
the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Ariel instrument characteristics. We
find that the observed variability depends strongly on the the assumed
chemistry and the instrument wavelength range, hence the probed altitude of the
atmosphere. With H$_2$/He only, the flux and variability originate near the
10$^5$~Pa level; with solar and higher metallicity, $\sim$10$^3$~Pa level is
probed, and the variability is distinguishably reduced. Our calculations show
that JWST and Ariel have the sensitivity to capture the atmospheric variability
of exoplanets like \WASPP, depending on the metallicity -- both in repeated
eclipse and phase-curve observations.

*Sean Jordan,Oliver Shorttle,Sascha P. Quanz*

TL;DR: The study shows that the planetary albedo of exoplanets like K2-18b is constrained by their above-cloud atmosphere, limiting their potential habitability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  
Background: The habitable zone for exoplanets depends on their planetary albedo, but this albedo is limited by the above-cloud atmosphere, which is the region probed in remote observations.

Data: Observational constraints from the above-cloud atmosphere of sub-Neptune K2-18b.

Method: An analytic model and a numerical multiple-scattering line-by-line radiative transfer model were used to explore and retrieve the planetary albedo.

Result: K2-18b's planetary albedo is restricted to values below the habitable threshold (median 0.17-0.18), indicating it is likely a magma-ocean or gas-dwarf world.

Abstract: Energy limits that delineate the `habitable zone' for exoplanets depend on a
given exoplanet's net planetary albedo (or `Bond albedo'). We here demonstrate
that the planetary albedo of an observed exoplanet is limited by the
above-cloud atmosphere - the region of the atmosphere that is probed in remote
observation. We derive an analytic model to explore how the maximum planetary
albedo depends on the above-cloud optical depth and scattering versus absorbing
properties, even in the limit of a perfectly reflective grey cloud layer. We
apply this framework to sub-Neptune K2-18b, for which a high planetary albedo
has recently been invoked to argue for the possibility of maintaining a liquid
water ocean surface, despite K2-18b receiving an energy flux from its host star
that places it inside of its estimated `habitable zone' inner edge. We use a
numerical multiple-scattering line-by-line radiative transfer model to retrieve
the albedo of K2-18b based on the observational constraints from the
above-cloud atmosphere. Our results demonstrate that K2-18b's observed
transmission spectrum already restricts its possible planetary albedo to values
below the threshold required to be potentially habitable, with the data
favouring a median planetary albedo of 0.17-0.18. Our results thus reveal that
currently characteriseable sub-Neptunes are likely to be magma-ocean or
gas-dwarf worlds. The methods that we present are generally applicable to
constrain the planetary albedo of any exoplanet with measurements of its
observable atmosphere, enabling the quantification of potential exoplanet
habitability with current observational capabilities.

Background: 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1（SW1）是最早发现的活跃半人马彗星，也是爆发最频繁的彗星，其爆发机制自1920年代发现以来一直是研究热点。

Data: 2017至2022年间利用NASA红外望远镜设施和洛厄尔发现望远镜获取的四组低分辨率近红外光谱数据，包括一次大爆发、两次低活动期和一次中等规模爆发。

Method: 通过建模分析光谱数据和尘埃颗粒分布，探讨爆发过程中尘埃与气体的耦合关系。

Result: 研究发现不同爆发阶段的尘埃颗粒分布显著不同，小颗粒加速更快；未检测到水冰吸收，表明冰主导颗粒的面积丰度低于1%。

Abstract: 29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1 (SW1) is both the first-discovered active Centaur
and the most outburst-prone comet known. The nature of SW1's many outbursts,
which regularly brighten the comet by five magnitudes or more, and what
processes power them has been of particular interest since SW1's discovery in
the 1920s. In this paper, we present and model four epochs of low-resolution
near-infrared spectroscopy of SW1 taken with the NASA Infrared Telescope
Facility and Lowell Discovery Telescope between 2017 and 2022. This dataset
includes one large outburst, two periods of low activity ("quiescence" or
"quiescent activity"), and one mid-sized outburst a few days after one of the
quiescent observations. The two quiescent epochs appear similar in both
spectral slope and modeled grain size distributions, but the two outbursts are
significantly different. We propose that the two can be reconciled if smaller
dust grains are accelerated more than larger ones, such that observations
closer to the onset of an outburst are more sensitive to the finer-grained dust
on the outside of the expanding cloud of material. These outbursts can thus
appear very rapid but there is still a period in which the dust and gas are
well-coupled. We find no strong evidence of water ice absorption in any of our
spectra, suggesting that the areal abundance of ice-dominated grains is less
than one percent. We conclude with a discussion of future modeling and
monitoring efforts which might be able to further advance our understanding of
this object's complicated activity patterns.

Background: 巨行星的大气组成与其起源之间的联系尚不明确，研究旨在通过模拟对流混合来揭示这种联系。

Data: 模拟了质量在0.3到3倍木星质量之间的气体巨行星的长期演化，考虑了不同的组成分布和原始熵值。

Result: 结果表明对流混合导致大气金属丰度随时间增加，且行星半径的演化受组成混合程度影响，这些信息可用于约束行星形成历史。

Abstract: The connection between the atmospheric composition of giant planets and their
origin remains elusive. In this study, we explore how convective mixing can
link the planetary primordial state to its atmospheric composition. We simulate
the long-term evolution of gas giants with masses between 0.3 and 3 Jupiter
masses, considering various composition profiles and primordial entropies
(assuming no entropy-mass dependence). Our results show that when convective
mixing is considered, the atmospheric metallicity increases with time and that
this time evolution encodes information about the planetary primordial
structure. Additionally, the degree of compositional mixing affects the
planetary radius, altering its evolution in a measurable way. By applying mock
observations, we demonstrate that combining radius and atmospheric composition
can help to constrain the planetary formation history. Young systems emerge as
prime targets for such characterization, with lower-mass gas giants
(approaching Saturn's mass) being particularly susceptible to mixing-induced
changes. Our findings highlight convective mixing as a key mechanism for
probing the primordial state of giant planets, offering new constraints on
formation models and demonstrating that the conditions inside giant planets
shortly after their formation are not necessarily erased over billions of years
and can leave a lasting imprint on their evolution.

### [56] [Origin of the Moon's Earth-like isotopic composition from giant impact on a differential rotating proto-Earth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12122)
*Wenshuai Liu*

TL;DR: The study proposes that a giant impact on a differentially rotating proto-Earth can produce a Moon-forming debris disk primarily from Earth's material, addressing isotopic composition similarities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  
Background: The giant impact theory explains the Moon's formation but struggles with isotopic composition similarities between Earth and Moon, as simulations suggest the debris disk mainly comes from the impactor.

Data: Simulations of giant impacts and the resulting debris disk composition.

Method: Modeling the impact of a sub-Mars-sized body on a differentially rotating proto-Earth.

Result: The proposed scenario yields a debris disk predominantly from the proto-Earth, aligning with isotopic similarities and angular momentum constraints.

Abstract: According to the giant impact theory, the Moon formed by accreting the
circum-terrestrial debris disk produced by Theia colliding with the
proto-Earth. The giant impact theory can explain most of the properties of the
Earth-Moon system, however, simulations of giant impact between a planetary
embryo and the growing proto-Earth indicate that the materials in the
circum-terrestrial debris disk produced by the impact originate mainly from the
impactor, contradicting with the fact that different Solar System bodies have
distinct compositions. Thus, the giant impact theory has difficulty explaining
the Moon's Earth-like isotopic compositions. More materials from the
proto-Earth could be delivered to the circum-terrestrial debris disk when a
slightly sub-Mars-sized body collides with a fast rotating planet of rigid
rotation but the resulting angular momentum is too large compared with that of
the current Earth-Moon system. Since planetesimals accreted by the proto-Earth
hit the surface of the proto-Earth, enhancing the rotation rate of the surface
of the proto-Earth. The surface's fast rotation rate relative to the slow
rotation rate of the inner region of the proto-Earth leads to transfer of
angular momentum from surface to inner, resulting in the differential rotation.
Here, we show that the giant impact of a sub-Mars-sized body on a differential
rotating proto-Earth with a fast rotating outer region and a relative slow
rotating inner region could result in a circum-terrestrial debris disk with
materials predominately from the proto-Earth without violating the angular
momentum constraint. The theory proposed here may provide a viable way of
explaining the similarity in the isotopic compositions of the Earth and Moon.

Result: 发现一颗极地环绕双星的系外行星，其轨道与双星系统高度倾斜。

Abstract: One notable example of exoplanet diversity is the population of circumbinary
planets, which orbit around both stars of a binary star system. There are so
far only 16 known circumbinary exoplanets, all of which lie in the same orbital
plane as the host binary. Suggestions exist that circumbinary planets could
also exist on orbits highly inclined to the binary, close to 90$^{\circ}$,
polar orbits. No such planets have been found yet but polar circumbinary gas
and debris discs have been observed and if these were to form planets then
those would be left on a polar orbit. We report strong evidence for a polar
circumbinary exoplanet, which orbits a close pair of brown dwarfs which are on
an eccentric orbit. We use radial-velocities to measure a retrograde apsidal
precession for the binary, and show that this can only be attributed to the
presence of a polar planet.

Background: 亚海王星前沿研究揭示了太阳系外行星环境的多样性，Hycean世界（具有全球海洋和富氢大气）的发现加速了寻找宜居环境的进程。

Data: 使用JWST MIRI LRS仪器获取的K2-18 b中红外（6-12 μm）传输光谱。

Method: 通过JWST MIRI LRS仪器进行中红外传输光谱分析。

Result: 光谱显示DMS和DMDS的存在（3σ显著性），且至少一种分子丰度≥10 ppmv，为Hycean世界的生物活动可能性提供了新证据。

Abstract: The sub-Neptune frontier has opened a new window into the rich diversity of
planetary environments beyond the solar system. The possibility of hycean
worlds, with planet-wide oceans and H$_2$-rich atmospheres, significantly
expands and accelerates the search for habitable environments elsewhere. Recent
JWST transmission spectroscopy of the candidate hycean world K2-18 b in the
near-infrared led to the first detections of carbon-bearing molecules CH$_4$
and CO$_2$ in its atmosphere, with a composition consistent with predictions
for hycean conditions. The observations also provided a tentative hint of
dimethyl sulfide (DMS), a possible biosignature gas, but the inference was of
low statistical significance. We report a mid-infrared transmission spectrum of
K2-18 b obtained using the JWST MIRI LRS instrument in the ~6-12 $\mu$m range.
The spectrum shows distinct features and is inconsistent with a featureless
spectrum at 3.4-$\sigma$ significance compared to our canonical model. We find
that the spectrum cannot be explained by most molecules predicted for K2-18 b
with the exception of DMS and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), also a potential
biosignature gas. We report new independent evidence for DMS and/or DMDS in the
atmosphere at 3-$\sigma$ significance, with high abundance ($\gtrsim$10 ppmv)
of at least one of the two molecules. More observations are needed to increase
the robustness of the findings and resolve the degeneracy between DMS and DMDS.
The results also highlight the need for additional experimental and theoretical
work to determine accurate cross sections of important biosignature gases and
identify potential abiotic sources. We discuss the implications of the present
findings for the possibility of biological activity on K2-18 b.

Background: 高RUWE值的Gaia视差测量通常被认为不可靠，但其偏差的程度和性质尚未量化。高RUWE通常由双星或多重性引起，这些源的视差具有重要天体物理意义。

Data: 使用Gaia历元天体测量模拟数据，以及已知轨道解的单星和宽双星数据。

Result: 研究发现高RUWE值的视差误差被低估1至4倍，校正后的误差能提供更可靠的距离估计，适用于多重系统、长/短周期双星和混合源。

Abstract: Gaia parallax measurements for stars with poor astrometric fits -- as
evidenced by high renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) -- are often assumed to
be unreliable, but the extent and nature of their biases remain poorly
quantified. High RUWE is usually a consequence of binarity or higher-order
multiplicity, so the parallaxes of sources with high RUWE are often of greatest
astrophysical interest. Using realistic simulations of Gaia epoch astrometry,
we show that the parallax uncertainties of sources with elevated RUWE are
underestimated by a factor that ranges from 1 to 4 and can be robustly
predicted from observables. We derive an empirical prescription to inflate
reported uncertainties based on a simple analytic function of RUWE, apparent
magnitude, and parallax. We validate the correction using (a) single-star
solutions for Gaia sources with known orbital solutions and (b) wide binaries
containing one component with elevated RUWE. The same uncertainty corrections
are expected to perform well in DR4 and DR5. Our results demonstrate that Gaia
parallaxes for high-RUWE sources can still yield robust distance estimates if
uncertainties are appropriately inflated, enabling distance constraints for
triples, binaries with periods too long or too short to be fit astrometrically,
and sources blended with neighboring sources.

Abstract: Mixtures of bare atomic nuclei on a nearly uniform degenerate electron
background are a realistic model of matter in the interior of white dwarfs.
Despite tremendous progress in understanding their phase diagrams achieved
mainly via first-principle simulations, structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic
properties of such mixtures are poorly understood. We develop a semi-analytic
model of the crystal state of binary mixtures based on the concept of mutual
short-range ordering of ions of different sorts. We derive analytic formulas
for electrostatic energy of crystal mixtures, including the effect of static
ion displacements from the lattice nodes, and estimate their residual entropy.
Then we perform free energy minimization with respect to the order parameters
for a C/O mixture at all relevant compositions and temperatures. The resulting
C/O phase diagram is in a reasonable agreement with that obtained in the most
recent first-principle study. The equilibrium microstructure of a crystallized
mixture is shown to evolve with decrease of temperature which, in principle,
can induce structural transitions. The latter will be accompanied by thermal
energy release. The proposed theory opens up a path to analyze ordering and
construct phase diagrams of ternary mixtures, which are of great practical
interest in astrophysics, as well as to improve calcuations of electron-ion
scattering rates and kinetic properties of dense crystallized matter.

Abstract: First-principle studies of radiative processes aimed at explaining the origin
of type II and type III solar radio bursts raise questions on the implications
of downshifted electron beam plasma excitations with frequency (slightly) below
the plasma frequency ($\omega\lesssim\omega_{pe}$) in the generation of radio
emissions. Unlike the beam-induced Langmuir waves ($\omega \gtrsim
\omega_{pe}$) in the standard radio emission plasma model, the primary wave
excitations of cooler and/or denser beams have predominantly downshifted
frequencies. Broadbands of such downshifted excitations are also confirmed by
in situ observations in association with terrestrial foreshock and electron
beams (in contrast to narrowband Langmuir waves), but their involvement in
radiative processes has not been examined so far. We revisit three radiative
scenarios specific to downshifted primary excitations, and the results
demonstrate their direct or indirect involvement in plasma radio emission.
Downshifted excitations of an electron beam primarily play an indirect role,
contributing to the relaxation to a plateau-on-tail still able to induce
Langmuir beam waves that satisfy conditions for nonlinear wave-wave
interactions leading to free radio waves. At longer time scales, the primary
excitations can become predominantly downshifted, and then directly couple with
the secondary (backscattered) Langmuir waves to generate the second harmonic of
radio emissions. Two counterbeams are more efficient and lead to faster
radiative mechanisms, involving counterpropagating downshifted excitations,
which couple to each other and generate intense, broadband and isotropic radio
spectra of downshifted second harmonics. Such a long-lasting (second) radio
harmonic can thus be invoked to distinguish regimes with downshifted ($\omega
\gtrsim \omega_{pe}$) primary excitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  
Background: Starless cores are crucial initial seeds of stars, but their origin and growth were poorly understood due to limited samples. The puzzling presence of CH$_3$OH emission in these cores adds complexity.

Data: Sensitive ALMA (Band 3) observations at 3 mm toward newly identified starless cores in the Orion Molecular Cloud.

Method: Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations combined with radiative transfer calculations and imaging simulations.

Result: Observed anti-correlated CH$_3$OH and N$_2$H$^+$ emission, explained by shock-induced desorption, and successfully reproduced by simulations, providing insights into core growth and complex organic molecules.

Abstract: Star formation is a series of mass assembly processes and starless cores,
those cold and dense condensations in molecular clouds, play a pivotal role as
initial seeds of stars. With only a limited sample of known starless cores,
however, the origin and growth of such stellar precursors had not been well
characterized previously. Meanwhile, the recent discovery of CH$_3$OH emission,
which is generally associated with desorbed icy mantle in warm regions,
particularly at the periphery of starless cores also remains puzzling. We
present sensitive ALMA (Band~3) observations (at 3~mm) toward a sample of newly
identified starless cores in the Orion Molecular Cloud. The spatially resolved
images distinctly indicate that the observed CH$_3$OH and N$_2$H$^+$ emission
associated with these cores are morphologically anti-correlated and
kinematically offset from each other. We postulate that the CH$_3$OH emission
highlights the desorption of icy mantle by shocks resulting from gas piling
onto dense cores in the filaments traced by N$_2$H$^+$. Our magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) simulations of star formation in turbulent clouds combined with radiative
transfer calculations and imaging simulations successfully reproduced the
observed signatures and reaffirmed the above scenario at work. Our result
serves as an intriguing and exemplary illustration, a snapshot in time, of the
dynamic star-forming processes in turbulent clouds. The results offer
compelling insights into the mechanisms governing the growth of starless cores
and the presence of gas-phase complex organic molecules associated with these
cores.

Abstract: Context. Tracing wave activity from the photosphere to the corona has
important implications for coronal heating and prediction of the solar wind.
Despite extensive theory and simulations, the detection of waves in realistic
MHD simulations still presents a large challenge due to wave interaction, mode
conversion, and damping mechanisms. Aims. We conducted this study to detect
localised wave activity within a realistic MHD simulation of the solar
atmosphere by the Bifrost code. Methods. We present a new method of detecting
the most significant contributions of wave activity within localised areas of
the domain, aided by Discrete Fourier Transforms and frequency filtering. We
correlate oscillations in the vertical & horizontal magnetic field, velocities
parallel & perpendicular to the magnetic field, and pressure to infer the
nature of the dominant wave modes. Results. Our method captures the most
powerful frequencies and wavenumbers, as well as providing a new diagnostic for
damping processes. We infer the presence of magnetoacoustic waves in the
boundaries of prominent chromospheric/coronal swirling features. We find these
waves are likely damped by viscous heating in the swirl boundaries,
contributing to heating in the upper atmosphere. Conclusions. Using the most
significant frequencies decomposition, we highlight that energy can be
transported from the lower atmosphere to the upper atmosphere through waves and
fluctuations along the swirl boundaries. Although further analysis is needed to
confirm these findings, our new method provides a path forward to investigate
wave activity in the solar atmosphere

Abstract: The period, mass ratio, eccentricity, and other orbital parameters are
fundamental for investigating binary star evolution. However, the number of
binaries with known orbital parameters remains limited. Utilizing the
LAMOST-MRS survey, we derived orbital solutions for 665 SB2 binaries by fitting
the radial velocities of 1119 SB2 systems with at least six observations,
employing a modified version of Thejoker optimized for SB2 binaries. To ensure
the reliability of the results, four selection criteria were applied: reduced
chi-square, normalized mean absolute error, maximum phase gap, and RV
distribution metric. After applying these criteria, 665 reliable orbits were
retained. Comparison with Kepler, TESS, and ZTF light curve data shows
excellent agreement, with discrepancies in some cases attributed to shorter
pulsation periods observed in light curves. Additionally, good consistency is
found between our periods and those of SB1 systems in Gaia data. These orbital
solutions contribute to understanding binary star evolution and the statistical
properties of binary populations.

Background: The formation of planets within the habitable zones of stars remains poorly understood, despite successful modeling of gas-giant planets at larger orbital separations.

Data: Observations from the MIRC-X and PIONIER instruments at the CHARA Array and VLTI over a two-month span.

Method: Optical interferometric techniques were used to analyze the motion of a disk feature near the dust-sublimation radius.

Result: A disk feature with a pattern speed less than half the local Keplerian velocity was localized, indicating potential planet formation activity.

Abstract: Planets are a natural byproduct of the stellar formation process, resulting
from local aggregations of material within the disks surrounding young stars.
Whereas signatures of gas-giant planets at large orbital separations have been
observed and successfully modeled within protoplanetary disks, the formation
pathways of planets within their host star's future habitable zones remain
poorly understood. Analyzing multiple nights of observations conducted over a
short, two-month span with the MIRC-X and PIONIER instruments at the CHARA
Array and VLTI, respectively, we uncover a highly active environment at the
inner-edge of the planet formation region in the disk of HD 163296. In
particular, we localize and track the motion of a disk feature near the
dust-sublimation radius with a pattern speed of less than half the local
Keplerian velocity, providing a potential glimpse at the planet formation
process in action within the inner astronomical unit. We emphasize that this
result is at the edge of what is currently possible with available optical
interferometric techniques and behooves confirmation with a temporally dense
followup observing campaign.

Abstract: Recent three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the
common-envelope interaction revealed the self-consistent formation of bipolar
magnetically driven outflows launched from a toroidal structure resembling a
circumbinary disk. So far, the dynamical impact of bipolar outflows on the
common-envelope phase remains uncertain and we aim to quantify its importance.
We illustrate the impact on common-envelope evolution by comparing two
simulations -- one with magnetic fields and one without -- using the
three-dimensional moving-mesh hydrodynamics code AREPO. We focus on the
specific case of a $10 M_\odot$ red supergiant star with a $5 M_\odot$ black
hole companion. By the end of the magnetohydrodynamic simulations (after $\sim
1220$ orbits of the core binary system), about $6.4 \%$ of the envelope mass is
ejected via the bipolar outflow, contributing to angular momentum extraction
from the disk structure and core binary. The resulting enhanced torques reduce
the final orbital separation by about $24 \%$ compared to the hydrodynamical
scenario, while the overall envelope ejection remains dominated by
recombination-driven equatorial winds. We analyze field amplification and
outflow launching mechanisms, confirming consistency with earlier studies:
magnetic fields are amplified by shear flows, and outflows are launched by a
magneto-centrifugal process, supported by local shocks and magnetic pressure
gradients. These outflows originate from $\sim 1.1$ times the orbital
separation. We conclude that the magnetically driven outflows and their role in
the dynamical interaction are a universal aspect, and we further propose an
adaptation of the $\alpha_\mathrm{CE}$-formalism by adjusting the final orbital
energy with a factor of $1+ M_\mathrm{out}/\mu$, where $M_\mathrm{out}$ is the
mass ejected through the outflows and $\mu$ the reduced mass of the core
binary. (abridged)

Abstract: We present the discovery of two quadruple star systems -- TIC 285853156 and
TIC 392229331 -- each consisting of two bound eclipsing binary stars. Among the
most compact quadruples known, TIC 392229331 and TIC 285853156 have the second
and third shortest outer orbital periods (145 days and 152 days, respectively)
after BU Canis Minoris (122 days, Pribulla et al. 2023). We demonstrate that
both systems are long-term dynamically stable despite substantial outer orbital
eccentricities (0.33 for TIC 285853156 and 0.56 for TIC 392229331). We
previously reported these systems in Kostov et al. (2022) and Kostov et al.
(2024) as 2+2 hierarchical quadruple candidates producing two sets of primary
and secondary eclipses in TESS data, as well as prominent eclipse timing
variations on both binary components. We combine all available TESS data and
new spectroscopic observations into a comprehensive photodynamical model,
proving that the component binary stars are gravitationally bound in both
systems and finding accurate stellar and orbital parameters for both systems,
including very precise determinations of the outer periods. TIC 285853156 and
TIC 392229331 represent the latest addition to the small population of
well-characterized proven quadruple systems dynamically interacting on
detectable timescales.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了量子热力学框架下信息删除的能量成本，发现系统的熵变化总是低于环境的热传递，并分析了场论视角下的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
  
Background: 在经典视角下，信息删除总是伴随着不可避免的能量成本，这一观点是Landauer猜想的核心，但并未对信息获取施加限制。尽管这一思维适用于任何尺度的系统，但其量子力学含义尤为引人关注。

Data: 使用了一对量子振荡器来描述系统和环境，通过适当的Hermitian相互作用放大初始状态的熵。

Method: 研究了量子热力学框架下的熵变化和热传递关系，并从场论角度分析了不同自旋粒子在时空曲率快速变化下的产生。

Result: 发现系统的熵变化总是低于环境的热传递，且当环境的初始热态具有化学势时，熵增长受到粒子和热流的双重限制。

Abstract: Within an inherently classical perspective, there is always an unavoidable
energy cost associated with the information deletion and this common lore is at
the heart of the Landauer's conjecture that does not impose, per se, any
relevant limit on the information acquisition. Although such a mindset should
generally apply to systems of any size, its quantum mechanical implications are
particularly intriguing and, for this reason, we examine here a minimal
physical structure where the system and the environment are described,
respectively, by a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by an appropriate
Hermitian interaction able to amplify the entropy of the initial state. Since
at the onset of the dynamical evolution the system is originally in a pure
state, its entropy variation is always positive semidefinite and the Landauer's
conjecture should not impose any constraint. Nonetheless, provided the quantum
amplification is effective, it turns out that the entropy variation of the
system always undershoots the heat transferred to the environment. When the
initial thermal state of the environment is characterized by a chemical
potential, the entropy growth is bounded both by the particles and by the heat
flowing to the environment. The limits deduced in the quantum thermodynamical
framework are also scrutinized from a field theory standpoint where species of
different spins are copiously produced (especially in a cosmological context)
thanks to the rapid variation of the space-time curvature.
