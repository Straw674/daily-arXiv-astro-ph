### [1] [What goes around comes around: the fate of stars in stripped tails of gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11526)
*Nina Akerman,Stephanie Tonnesen,Bianca M. Poggianti,Rory Smith,Ariel Werle,Eric Giunchi,Benedetta Vulcani,Jacopo Fritz*

**TL;DR**: The study uses high-resolution wind-tunnel simulations to analyze in-situ star formation in the stripped tails of two massive galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping, revealing insights into star ages, velocities, metallicities, and eventual fallback onto the galaxies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The research focuses on the current understanding of star formation in the stripped tails of massive galaxies ($M_\text{star}=10^{11}M_\odot$) undergoing ram-pressure stripping, highlighting the need to study the dynamics and properties of stars formed in such environments.

Data: The study utilizes high-resolution wind-tunnel simulations of two massive galaxies: one stripped face-on (W0) and the other subject to an angled wind (W45).

Method: High-resolution wind-tunnel simulations are employed to model the ram-pressure stripping process and analyze star formation in the stripped tails of the galaxies.

Result: The majority of stars in the tail form near the galaxy disc initially, with older stars found at larger radii. ICM mixing affects star velocities and metallicities, leading to faster, lower metallicity stars farther from the galaxies. A significant fraction (15--25%) of tail stars have negative velocities, indicating gas fallback. Most tail stars within 20 kpc of the disc will fall back, contributing negligibly to intracluster light. The stellar distribution around the disc is extended and asymmetric (for W45), but UV images show no significant broadening of the vertical star distribution compared to undisturbed galaxies.

Abstract: We conduct high-resolution wind-tunnel simulations to study in-situ star
formation in the stripped tails of two massive ($M_\text{star}=10^{11}M_\odot$)
galaxies undergoing time-evolving ram-pressure stripping: one is stripped
face-on (W0) and the other is subject to an angled wind (W45). We find that the
majority of stars in the tail are formed close to the galaxy disc at the
beginning of stripping. Most stars have ages that reflect outside-in stripping
-- older stars are found at larger radii than younger stars. The velocities and
metallicities of stars indicate that ICM mixing both increases the velocity and
decreases the metallicity of star-forming gas, leading to faster, lower
metallicity stars at larger distances from the galaxies. However, not all stars
follow this simple model, even in the case of face-on stripping. Indeed, a
considerable number (15--25 per cent) of tail stars are formed with negative
velocities, indicating the fallback of star-forming gas on to the galaxy.
Almost all of the tail stars formed within 20 kpc from the disc will eventually
fall back on to the galaxy, and their contribution to the intracluster light is
negligible. The orbits of the stars formed in the tail result in an extended
(and asymmetric in the case of W45) stellar distribution around the disc. Mock
UV images reveal that the observed vertical distribution of its stars is not
significantly broader than in an undisturbed galaxy, indicating that more stars
would need to form in the stripped tail than we find in our simulations to
observably impact the UV disc width of ram pressure stripped galaxies.

### [2] [Oxyster: A Circumgalactic Low-ionization Oxygen Nebula next to a Starburst Galaxy at $z\sim1$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11531)
*Pengjun Lu,Mingyu Li,Dalya Baron,Minghao Yue,Song Huang,Zheng Cai*

**TL;DR**: Researchers discovered 'Oxyster', a large ionized nebula near an interacting starburst galaxy at z=0.924, using Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam narrow-band imaging and spectroscopy, revealing unique properties that challenge standard photoionization and shock models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Extended emission line nebulae around galaxies or AGNs offer insights into the circumgalactic medium (CGM), but Oxyster's properties differ from typical AGN light echoes, suggesting new avenues for studying the CGM of normal galaxies in the early Universe.

Data: Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam narrow-band imaging and spectroscopic follow-up data, along with HST and JWST images, were used to analyze the nebula and host galaxy.

Method: The study employed narrow-band imaging and spectroscopic follow-up to detect and analyze the nebula, combined with spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting for the host galaxy.

Result: Oxyster exhibits extended [OII] and [OIII] emission lines, a low [OIII]/[OII] ratio, and challenges standard photoionization models, possibly indicating a recent starburst and low-luminosity AGN.

Abstract: Extended emission line nebulae around galaxies or active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) provide a unique window to investigate the galactic ecosystem through
the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Using Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam narrow-band
imaging and spectroscopic follow-up, we serendipitously discover "Oxyster" - a
large ionized nebula next to an interacting starburst galaxy at $z=0.924$. The
nebula is traced by extended [OII]3726,3729 ($\sim 30$ kpc) and [OIII]5007
($\sim 20$ kpc) emission lines. On the nebula luminosity-size plane, Oxyster
surpasses the extended narrow-line regions around low-$z$ AGNs, resembling a
higher-$z$ analog of "Hanny's Voorwerp". However, its uniformly low
[OIII]/[OII] ratio (O32) sets it apart from typical AGN light echoes. For the
host galaxy, HST and JWST images reveal a disturbed red disk galaxy with a
single blue spiral "arm". Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting suggests
the $2-6\times 10^{10} ~\rm M_{\odot}$ host galaxy sits above the star-forming
main sequence with an ongoing starburst, especially in the "arm", and have
$<5\%$ luminosity contribution from AGN, consistent with X-ray non-detection
and radio continuum. Standard photoionization and shock models struggle to
explain simultaneously Oxyster's emission line luminosities, low O32 ratio, and
the non-detection of H$\beta$ line. A plausible explanation could involve the
combination of a recent ($<10^8$ yrs) starburst and a low-luminosity AGN
($L_{\rm{bol}} \sim 1\times10^{42}$ erg/s). While Oxyster's nature awaits
future investigation, its discovery highlights the potential of ground-based
narrow-band imaging to uncover extended emission line nebulae around non-AGN
systems, opening new avenues for studying the CGM of normal galaxies in the
early Universe.

**TL;DR**: 通过分析Gaia Alerts和Gaia Data Release 3数据，本研究利用微引力透镜效应确定了四个高放大率事件，并推断出透镜可能是白矮星或中子星等恒星残骸。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 微引力透镜事件为探测和测量孤立、非发光天体（尤其是暗恒星残骸）的质量提供了独特方法。当微引力透镜光变曲线显示有限源效应时，仅通过测光即可测量这些天体的质量。

Data: 使用了Gaia Alerts和Gaia Data Release 3数据集。

Method: 通过分析微引力透镜光变曲线中的有限源效应，使用DarkLensCode软件基于银河系模型估计透镜的质量、距离和亮度分布。

Result: 研究确定了透镜质量下限（约0.2-0.5太阳质量），DarkLensCode分析进一步支持透镜可能是恒星残骸（质量范围约0.42-1.66太阳质量，暗透镜概率超过60%）。

Abstract: Microlensing events provide a unique way to detect and measure the masses of
isolated, non-luminous objects, particularly dark stellar remnants. Under
certain conditions, it is possible to measure the mass of these objects using
photometry alone, specifically when a microlensing light curve displays a
finite-source (FS) effect. This effect generally occurs in highly magnified
light curves, i.e. when the source and the lens are very well aligned. In this
study, we analyse Gaia Alerts and Gaia Data Release 3 datasets, identifying
four moderate-to-high-magnification microlensing events without a discernible
FS effect. The absence of this effect suggests a large Einstein radius,
implying substantial lens masses. In each event, we constrain the FS effect and
therefore establish lower limits for angular Einstein radius and lens mass.
Additionally, we use the DarkLensCode software to obtain mass, distance, and
brightness distribution for the lens based on the Galactic model. Our analysis
established lower mass limits of $\sim 0.2$ $M_{\odot}$ for one lens and $\sim
0.3-0.5$ $M_{\odot}$ for two others. DarkLensCode analysis supports these
findings, estimating lens masses in the range of$\sim 0.42-1.66$ $M_{\odot}$
and dark lens probabilities exceeding 60\%. These results strongly indicate
that the lenses are stellar remnants, such as white dwarfs or neutron stars.
While further investigations are required to confirm the nature of these
lenses, we demonstrate a straightforward yet effective approach to identifying
stellar remnant candidates.

*Antonio J. Porras-Valverde,Angelo Ricarte,Priyamvada Natarajan,Rachel S. Somerville,Austen Gabrielpillai,L. Y. Aaron Yung*

**TL;DR**: 通过半解析模型（SAMs）研究超大质量黑洞（SMBHs）的质量组装，发现物理模型与观测在局部黑洞质量函数（BHMF）上存在显著差异，但大多数模型在$z \sim 1-4$和JWST观测的宽线AGN BHMF在$z=4-5$上表现一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系与其中心的超大质量黑洞（SMBHs）通过燃料供给和反馈共同演化，但这种共演化的起源和细节尚不明确，且不同建模框架之间存在显著差异。

Data: 使用半解析模型（SAMs）追踪$M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{6-10}, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$范围内的SMBH质量组装。

Method: 通过半解析模型（SAMs）分析SMBH质量组装和吸积历史，特别关注允许超爱丁顿吸积的{\sc Dark Sage}模型。

Result: 研究发现物理模型与观测在局部黑洞质量函数（BHMF）上存在显著差异，但大多数模型在$z \sim 1-4$和JWST观测的宽线AGN BHMF在$z=4-5$上表现一致。{\sc Dark Sage}模型预测的AGN光度函数中的“膝盖”与$z=5-6$的“小红点”光度一致。SMBHs在{\sc Dark Sage}中主要通过盘不稳定性和合并驱动的冷气体吸积增长，黑洞合并仅对$z=0$时最巨大SMBHs的总质量贡献60%。

Abstract: Galaxies grow alongside their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs),
linked through fueling and feedback. However, the origins and details of this
co-evolution remain unclear and differ significantly amongst modeling
frameworks. Using a suite of semi-analytic models (SAMs), we trace SMBH mass
assembly across $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{6-10}, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We find
significant discrepancies between observations and physics-based models of the
local black hole mass function (BHMF), likely due to differences in the
underlying stellar mass function and the scaling relations therefrom used to
infer the BHMF. However, most physics-based models agree at $z \sim 1-4$ and
align reasonably well with broad-line AGN BHMF from JWST observations at
$z=4-5$. Most physics-based models reproduce the bolometric AGN luminosity
evolution, except {\sc Dark Sage}, which predicts an excess deviating from
models and observations. Interestingly, this pronounced ``knee' in the
bolometric AGN luminosity function predicted by {\sc Dark Sage} around $L_{\rm
bol} \sim 10^{46} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ is consistent with the inferred
luminosity of ``Little Red Dots'' at $z=5-6$, assuming that their entire
emission originates from AGN activity. We analyze black hole mass build-up and
accretion histories in {\sc Dark Sage}, which, unlike other models, allows for
super-Eddington accretion. We report that on average, SMBHs in {\sc Dark Sage}
primarily grow through secular disk instabilities and merger-driven cold gas
accretion, while black hole mergers contribute 60\% of the total mass budget
only for the most massive SMBHs by $z=0$.

### [5] [Trials and Tribulations of Chemodynamical Tagging: Investigating the Recovery of Open Clusters in the Gaia DR3-GALAH DR4 Catalog](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11586)
*Nicholas A. Barth,David Mendez,Rana Ezzeddine,Yuxi,Lu,Leslie M. Morales,Zachary R. Claytor,Jamie Tayar*

**TL;DR**: The study evaluates the efficacy of chemodynamical tagging for recovering open clusters using dynamical and chemical data from Gaia DR3 and GALAH DR4, finding that dynamical orbital parameters perform best but recovery rates remain low.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Chemodynamical tagging is a proposed method to trace stars back to their birth clusters, but its effectiveness is debated. This study investigates its application to open clusters using data from Gaia DR3 and GALAH DR4.

Data: The study uses dynamical data from Gaia DR3 and chemical data from GALAH DR4, focusing on open clusters and mock field stars.

Method: A bootstrap analysis evaluates combinations of orbital components (E, JR, Jφ, JZ) and chemical abundances ([X/Fe] for multiple elements) in the clustering algorithm HBDSCAN to assess recovery rates of open clusters.

Result: Dynamical orbital parameters yield the highest recovery rates, but overall recovery rates are low. Adding cuts based on metallicity, age, and birth radii can marginally improve recovery rates.

Abstract: Chemodynamical tagging has been suggested as a powerful tool to trace stars
back to their birth clusters. However, the efficacy of chemodynamical tagging
as a means to recover individual stellar clusters is still under debate. In
this study, we present a detailed investigation of chemodynamical tagging of
open clusters using both dynamical and chemical data from the \textit{Gaia} DR3
and GALAH DR4 surveys, respectively. Using a sample of open clusters and mock
field stars, we conduct a bootstrap analysis to evaluate every unique
combination of orbital components ($E, J_R, J_\phi, J_Z$) and chemical
abundances ([X/Fe] for O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Y, and
Ba) on how well they recover open clusters when used as parameters in the
clustering algorithm, HBDSCAN. We find that using primarily dynamical orbital
parameters leads to the highest recovery rate of open cluster stars.
Nevertheless, even employing the best performing parameter combinations leads
to low open cluster recovery rates. We find that, in most cases, chemodynamical
tagging of open clusters using blind clustering algorithms is not efficient,
which is in line with previous theoretical and observational work. However, we
show that the addition of cuts based on metallicity, age, and birth radii in
order to reduce the size of the clustering catalog can marginally improve the
recovery rate of open clusters.

### [6] [New dwarf galaxy candidates in the M106, NGC3521, and UGCA127 groups with the Hyper Suprime Camera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11608)
*Oliver Müller,Helmut Jerjen,Salvatore Taibi,Nick Heesters,Ethan Crosby,Marcel S. Pawlowski*

**TL;DR**: The study reports the discovery of 21 new dwarf galaxy candidates around nearby isolated luminous host galaxies using Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging, extending previous findings and analyzing their properties and luminosity functions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The local universe contains many undiscovered dwarf galaxies, and deep imaging campaigns are essential for their detection. Previous studies in this series identified dwarf galaxy candidates around M104 and NGC2683, highlighting the need for further exploration.

Data: The study uses imaging data from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam to visually inspect and identify dwarf galaxy candidates around M106, NGC2903, NGC3521, and UGCA127.

Method: Visual inspection of deep imaging data was employed to identify dwarf galaxy candidates, supplemented by artificial galaxy experiments to assess completeness.

Result: The study found 11, 0, 4, and 6 dwarf galaxy candidates around M106, NGC2903, NGC3521, and UGCA127, respectively, extending the total to 55 candidates. The candidates follow known scaling relations, and their luminosity functions were traced down to a magnitude of ≈−9 in the V band. The results suggest similarities between some host galaxies and the Milky Way in terms of dwarf galaxy abundance.

Abstract: The local universe is still full of hidden dwarf galaxies to be discovered
using deep imaging campaigns. Here we present the third paper in a series to
search for low-surface brightness dwarf galaxies around nearby isolated
luminous host galaxies with the Subaru Hyper Suprime Camera. Based on visual
inspection, we found 11, 0, 4, and 6 dwarf galaxy candidates around M106,
NGC2903, NGC3521, and UGCA127, respectively. This adds to the 40 candidates
around M104 and 4 candidates around NGC2683 found in the previous papers.
Artificial galaxy experiments show that we are complete down to a mean
effective surface brightness of 26 mag/arcsec$^2$. The new dwarf galaxy
candidates follow known scaling relation in size, surface brightness and
luminosity, making them good candidates based on their morphology and
photometric properties. We trace the luminosity function of these galaxies down
to magnitude of $\approx-$9 in the V band for all galaxies targeted in our
survey footprint so far. While the most massive galaxy (M104) has a significant
higher abundance of dwarfs, NGC3521, NGC2903, and NGC2683 have a similar
luminosity function as the Milky Way. These latter three galaxies also have a
similar stellar mass and might be considered Milky Way analogs. UGCA127 is a
low-mass galaxy but almost reaches the same number of dwarfs as the Milky Way
at our limiting magnitude. We have searched for hints of lopsidedness in the
satellite distributions, but found none to be significant. The next step will
be to confirm these members through either distance or velocity measurements.

Result: Error

Abstract: Spiral arms are a common feature of local galaxies, but the exact form of the
distribution of mass and light in them is not well known. In this work, we aim
to measure this distribution as accurately as possible, focusing on individual
spiral arms and using the so-called slicing method. The sample consists of 19
well-resolved, viewed face-on spiral galaxies from the S$^4$G survey. We work
primarily with infrared images at 3.6 $\mu$m from the same survey, and,
secondarily, with ultraviolet data from the GALEX telescope. We derive the
properties of the spiral arms step by step, starting from their overall shape,
then measuring their brightness profile and width variation along the arm, and
then examining the fine structure of the profile across the arm, namely its
skewness and S\'{e}rsic index. We construct a 2D photometric function of the
spiral arm that can be used in further decomposition studies, validate it and
identify the most and least important parameters. Finally, we show how our
results can be used to unravel the nature of the spiral arms, supporting the
evidence that NGC 4535 has a density wave in its disc.

**TL;DR**: DESI Milky Way survey data and clustering analysis reveal the Cocytos stream, a disrupted globular cluster likely from the Gaia-Enceladus merger, showcasing the potential of wide-field spectroscopic surveys to study faint stellar structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The census of stellar streams and dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way is crucial for galaxy formation models and dark matter studies. The DESI Milky Way survey, with its extensive footprint and depth, provides a unique opportunity to detect previously undetected streams and dwarf galaxies.

Data: DESI year 3 data and Magellan/MagE spectroscopy.

Method: Clustering analysis with a catalog of giants in the DESI data, supplemented with spectroscopy.

Result: The Cocytos stream is identified as a metal-rich, thick stream at 25 kpc with an internal velocity dispersion of 6.5-9 km s$^{-1}$, likely a disrupted globular cluster from the Gaia-Enceladus merger, and associated with the Pyxis globular cluster.

Abstract: The census of stellar streams and dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way provides
direct constraints on galaxy formation models and the nature of dark matter.
The DESI Milky Way survey (with a footprint of 14,000$~deg{^2}$ and a depth of
$r<19$ mag) delivers the largest sample of distant metal-poor stars compared to
previous optical fiber-fed spectroscopic surveys. This makes DESI an ideal
survey to search for previously undetected streams and dwarf galaxies. We
present a detailed characterization of the Cocytos stream, which was
re-discovered using a clustering analysis with a catalog of giants in the DESI
year 3 data, supplemented with Magellan/MagE spectroscopy. Our analysis reveals
a relatively metal-rich ([Fe/H]$=-1.3$) and thick stream (width$=1.5^\circ$) at
a heliocentric distance of $\approx 25$ kpc, with an internal velocity
dispersion of 6.5-9 km s$^{-1}$. The stream's metallicity, radial orbit, and
proximity to the Virgo stellar overdensities suggest that it is most likely a
disrupted globular cluster that came in with the Gaia-Enceladus merger. We also
confirm its association with the Pyxis globular cluster. Our result showcases
the ability of wide-field spectroscopic surveys to kinematically discover faint
disrupted dwarfs and clusters, enabling constraints on the dark matter
distribution in the Milky Way.

**TL;DR**: 该研究利用AstroSat/UVIT的F154W和N242W成像数据，构建并分析了GOODS-S深场中红移范围z~0.4-0.8的紫外光度函数（UVLF），发现其斜率（α）和特征星等（M*）与先前研究一致，但归一化因子（φ*）存在差异，并揭示了宇宙恒星形成率的快速上升和下降趋势。

Background: 紫外光度函数（UVLF）是研究宇宙恒星形成历史的重要工具，但不同观测设备和红移范围的结果存在差异。本研究旨在通过AstroSat/UVIT的深场观测，进一步验证和补充现有的UVLF参数，并探讨宇宙恒星形成率的演化趋势。

Data: 使用了AstroSat/UVIT的F154W和N242W成像数据，覆盖GOODS-S深场，红移范围包括z<0.13（FUV）和z~0.4-0.8（NUV）。

Method: 通过拟合Schechter函数参数，构建并分析了紫外光度函数（UVLF），并结合文献数据计算了紫外光度密度（ρ_UV），以研究宇宙恒星形成率的演化。

Result: 研究发现UVLF的斜率（α）和特征星等（M*）与先前研究一致，但归一化因子（φ*）在某些红移区间存在差异。宇宙恒星形成率在z~3达到峰值后缓慢下降，且上升和下降的速度比先前研究更快。

Abstract: We characterise the rest-frame 1500 \r{A} UV luminosity Function (UVLF) from
deep AstroSat/UVIT F154W and N242W imaging in the Great Observatories Origins
Survey South (GOODS-S) deep field. The UVLFs are constructed and subsequently
characterised with fitted Schechter function parameters from FUV observations
at z$<0.13$ and NUV observations in seven redshift bins in z~0.8-0.4. The UVLF
slope ($\alpha$) and characteristic magnitude ($M^*$) are consistent with
previous determinations for this redshift range based on AstroSat/UVIT
GOODS-North observations, as well as with those from Galaxy evolution Explorer
and Hubble Space Telescope observations. However, differences in the
normalisation factor ($\phi_{*}$) are present for UVLFs for some redshift bins.
We compute the UV luminosity density, $\rho_{\rm UV}$, combining our determined
UVLF parameters with literature determinations out to z$\sim10$. The $\rho_{\rm
UV}$ trend with redshift implies the rapid increase in cosmic star formation
till its peak at z$\sim3$ (cosmic noon) followed by a slow decline till present
day. Both the initial increase in cosmic star formation and subsequent decline
are found to be more rapid than previous determinations.

**TL;DR**: The study investigates whether a compact dark perturber in the SDSSJ0946+1006 lensing system can be explained by a core-collapsed halo in the self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model, finding challenges in reconciling the model with observational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Previous studies identified an extremely compact dark perturber in the SDSSJ0946+1006 lensing system, challenging the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. This paper explores whether such a perturber could be a core-collapsed halo within the SIDM framework.

Data: Observational data from the SDSSJ0946+1006 lensing system (the "Jackpot") and prior Hubble imaging.

Method: The isothermal Jeans method is used to compute the density profiles of core-collapsed halos across a range of masses.

Result: A core-collapsed halo with a total mass of approximately $10^{11}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ could match the inner density profile and mass within 1 kpc, but the absence of a detectable galaxy in Hubble imaging poses a challenge to the SIDM model.

Abstract: Previous studies, based on precise modeling of a gravitationally lensing
image, have identified what may be a extremely compact, dark perturber in the
well-known lensing system SDSSJ0946+1006 (the "Jackpot"). Its remarkable
compactness challenges the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. In this
paper, we explore whether such a compact perturber could be explained as a
core-collapsed halo described by the self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model.
Using the isothermal Jeans method, we compute the density profiles of
core-collapsed halos across a range of masses. Our comparison with observations
indicates that only a core-collapsed halo with a total mass of approximately
$10^{11}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ could produce an inner density profile and mass
enclosed within 1 kpc that is consistent with observational data. However, such
a massive dark matter halo should host a galaxy detectable by prior Hubble
imaging, which is not observed. Thus, the core-collapsed SIDM halo model
struggles to fully account for the exotic nature of the "little dark dot" in
the "Jackpot" lens.

*Nils Hoyer,Silvia Bonoli,Nate Bastian,Diego Herrero-Carrión,Nadine Neumayer,David Izquierdo-Villalba,Daniele Spinoso,Robert M. Yates,Markos Polkas,M. Celeste Artale*

**TL;DR**: The study introduces a modified version of the L-Galaxies model to simulate star cluster formation and evolution, successfully reproducing observational trends and highlighting the complexity of star cluster populations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The formation history of star cluster populations is linked to their host galaxies, but limited understanding of star cluster assembly hinders their use as tracers of galaxy evolution.

Data: The study uses properties of galaxy components and localized star formation to determine the bound fraction of star formation in disks, along with randomly sampled masses from an environmentally-dependent star cluster initial mass function.

Method: A modified version of the semi-analytical galaxy formation model "L-Galaxies" is employed, incorporating star cluster formation above 10^4 M_Sun and considering physical assumptions affecting their evolution, including stellar evolution, tidal shocks, and dynamical friction.

Result: The simulation reproduces observational quantities like the relationship between the brightest young star clusters and host galaxy star formation rates, and reveals complex star cluster populations at z = 0 due to differential destruction channels and origins.

Abstract: It is established that there exists a direct link between the formation
history of star cluster populations and their host galaxies, however, our
lacking understanding of star cluster assembly prohibits us to make full use of
their ability to trace galaxy evolution. In this work we introduce a new
variation of the 2020 version of the semi-analytical galaxy formation model
"L-Galaxies" that includes the formation of star clusters above 10^4 M_Sun and
probes different physical assumptions that affect their evolution over cosmic
time. We use properties of different galaxy components and localised star
formation to determine the bound fraction of star formation in disks. After
randomly sampling masses from an environmentally-dependent star cluster initial
mass function, we assign to each object a half-mass radius, metallicity, and
distance from the galaxy centre. We consider up to 2000 individual star
clusters per galaxy and evolve their properties over time taking into account
stellar evolution, two-body relaxation, tidal shocks, dynamical friction, and a
re-positioning during galaxy mergers. Our simulation successfully reproduces
several observational quantities, such as the empirical relationship between
the absolute V -band magnitude of the brightest young star clusters and the
host galaxy star formation rate, the mass function of young star clusters, or
mean metallicities of the star cluster distributions versus galaxy masses. The
simulation reveals great complexity in the z = 0 star cluster population
resulting from differential destruction channels and origins, including in-situ
populations in the disk, a major merger-induced heated component in the halo,
and accreted star clusters. Model variations point out the importance of e.g.
the shape of the star cluster initial mass function or the relationship between
the sound speed of cold gas and the star formation rate.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The research focuses on a spectroscopically confirmed protocluster at z=3.24, aiming to understand its evolution into a Virgo-like cluster by z=0 and the properties of its constituent galaxies.

Data: Narrowband imaging data from CFHT/WIRCam and multiwavelength data are used to study the protocluster and its galaxies.

Method: The study employs narrowband imaging to identify [O III] emission line galaxies and analyzes their physical properties using multiwavelength data.

Result: The protocluster contains 24 [O III] emitters, which are medium-mass star-forming galaxies following the main sequence, with spatial offsets from other galaxy populations suggesting different dark matter halo formation epochs.

Abstract: We present a narrowband imaging on a spectroscopically confirmed protocluster
``D4UD01'' at z=3.24 using CFHT/WIRCam. We identify a sample of 24 [O III]
emission line galaxies in the field, which forms a large overdensity in the
protocluster region. The protocluster is expected to evolve into a Virgo-like
cluster by z=0. Utilizing multiwavelength data, we derive the physical
properties of these [O III] emitters and find they are medium mass normal
star-forming galaxies ($\sim10^{10}$M$_\odot$) roughly following the
star-forming main sequence. The [O III] emitters trace an overdensity spatially
offset from that of photometric-redshift and quiescent galaxies, suggesting
these distinct galaxy populations may inhabit dark matter halos that formed at
different epochs. A comparative analysis of [O III] emitter properties shows
similar characteristics in both protocluster and field environments. This
protocluster likely represents an evolved structure that has progressed beyond
its peak star-formation phase, although our limited sample size may prevent
detection of subtle environmental effects.

### [13] [How to use Gaia parallaxes for stars with poor astrometric fits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11528)
*Kareem El-Badry*

**TL;DR**: The study quantifies biases in Gaia parallax measurements for stars with high RUWE, showing that their uncertainties are underestimated and providing an empirical correction to improve distance estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Gaia parallax measurements for stars with high RUWE are often assumed unreliable due to binarity or multiplicity, but the extent of their biases is poorly understood, despite their astrophysical significance.

Data: The study uses realistic simulations of Gaia epoch astrometry and validates results with single-star solutions for Gaia sources with known orbital solutions and wide binaries with elevated RUWE.

Method: An empirical prescription is derived to inflate reported parallax uncertainties based on RUWE, apparent magnitude, and parallax, validated through simulations and observational data.

Result: The research demonstrates that Gaia parallaxes for high-RUWE sources can yield robust distance estimates if uncertainties are appropriately inflated, benefiting studies of binaries, triples, and blended sources.

Abstract: Gaia parallax measurements for stars with poor astrometric fits -- as
evidenced by high renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) -- are often assumed to
be unreliable, but the extent and nature of their biases remain poorly
quantified. High RUWE is usually a consequence of binarity or higher-order
multiplicity, so the parallaxes of sources with high RUWE are often of greatest
astrophysical interest. Using realistic simulations of Gaia epoch astrometry,
we show that the parallax uncertainties of sources with elevated RUWE are
underestimated by a factor that ranges from 1 to 4 and can be robustly
predicted from observables. We derive an empirical prescription to inflate
reported uncertainties based on a simple analytic function of RUWE, apparent
magnitude, and parallax. We validate the correction using (a) single-star
solutions for Gaia sources with known orbital solutions and (b) wide binaries
containing one component with elevated RUWE. The same uncertainty corrections
are expected to perform well in DR4 and DR5. Our results demonstrate that Gaia
parallaxes for high-RUWE sources can still yield robust distance estimates if
uncertainties are appropriately inflated, enabling distance constraints for
triples, binaries with periods too long or too short to be fit astrometrically,
and sources blended with neighboring sources.

### [14] [ALMASOP. Detection of Turbulence-induced Mass Assembly Shocks in Starless Cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11776)
*Shih-Ying Hsu,Sheng-Yuan Liu,Xunchuan Liu,Pak Shing Li,Tie Liu,Dipen Sahu,Kenichi Tatematsu,Shanghuo Li,Naomi Hirano,Chin-Fei Lee,Sheng-Jun Lin*

**TL;DR**: The study uses ALMA observations and MHD simulations to explore the dynamic processes of starless cores in the Orion Molecular Cloud, revealing insights into their growth and the presence of complex organic molecules.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Starless cores, as initial seeds of stars, play a crucial role in star formation, but their origin and growth were previously poorly characterized. The discovery of CH$_3$OH emission at the periphery of these cores adds to the mystery.

Data: Sensitive ALMA (Band~3) observations at 3 mm toward newly identified starless cores in the Orion Molecular Cloud.

Method: Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of star formation in turbulent clouds combined with radiative transfer calculations and imaging simulations.

Result: The study found that CH$_3$OH and N$_2$H$^+$ emissions are morphologically anti-correlated and kinematically offset, suggesting desorption of icy mantle by shocks. The simulations successfully reproduced these observations, providing insights into the growth of starless cores and the presence of complex organic molecules.

Abstract: Star formation is a series of mass assembly processes and starless cores,
those cold and dense condensations in molecular clouds, play a pivotal role as
initial seeds of stars. With only a limited sample of known starless cores,
however, the origin and growth of such stellar precursors had not been well
characterized previously. Meanwhile, the recent discovery of CH$_3$OH emission,
which is generally associated with desorbed icy mantle in warm regions,
particularly at the periphery of starless cores also remains puzzling. We
present sensitive ALMA (Band~3) observations (at 3~mm) toward a sample of newly
identified starless cores in the Orion Molecular Cloud. The spatially resolved
images distinctly indicate that the observed CH$_3$OH and N$_2$H$^+$ emission
associated with these cores are morphologically anti-correlated and
kinematically offset from each other. We postulate that the CH$_3$OH emission
highlights the desorption of icy mantle by shocks resulting from gas piling
onto dense cores in the filaments traced by N$_2$H$^+$. Our magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) simulations of star formation in turbulent clouds combined with radiative
transfer calculations and imaging simulations successfully reproduced the
observed signatures and reaffirmed the above scenario at work. Our result
serves as an intriguing and exemplary illustration, a snapshot in time, of the
dynamic star-forming processes in turbulent clouds. The results offer
compelling insights into the mechanisms governing the growth of starless cores
and the presence of gas-phase complex organic molecules associated with these
cores.

*Sufen Guo,Mikhail Kovalev,Jiao Li,Guoliang Lu,Shi Jia,Zhenwei Li,Jiangdan Li,Jianping Xiong,Mingkuan Yang,Tongyu He,Xuefei Chen,Zhanwen Han*

**TL;DR**: The study derived orbital solutions for 665 SB2 binaries using LAMOST-MRS survey data, employing a modified version of Thejoker, and validated the results through multiple criteria and comparisons with other datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Binary star evolution research is limited by the scarcity of known orbital parameters, highlighting the need for more comprehensive studies.

Data: The study used radial velocity data from 1119 SB2 systems with at least six observations from the LAMOST-MRS survey, and compared results with Kepler, TESS, ZTF light curve data, and Gaia SB1 systems.

Method: A modified version of Thejoker optimized for SB2 binaries was employed to fit radial velocities, with four selection criteria (reduced chi-square, normalized mean absolute error, maximum phase gap, and RV distribution metric) applied to ensure reliability.

Result: The study obtained 665 reliable orbital solutions, showing excellent agreement with other datasets, though some discrepancies were noted due to shorter pulsation periods in light curves, and contributed to understanding binary star evolution and population statistics.

Abstract: The period, mass ratio, eccentricity, and other orbital parameters are
fundamental for investigating binary star evolution. However, the number of
binaries with known orbital parameters remains limited. Utilizing the
LAMOST-MRS survey, we derived orbital solutions for 665 SB2 binaries by fitting
the radial velocities of 1119 SB2 systems with at least six observations,
employing a modified version of Thejoker optimized for SB2 binaries. To ensure
the reliability of the results, four selection criteria were applied: reduced
chi-square, normalized mean absolute error, maximum phase gap, and RV
distribution metric. After applying these criteria, 665 reliable orbits were
retained. Comparison with Kepler, TESS, and ZTF light curve data shows
excellent agreement, with discrepancies in some cases attributed to shorter
pulsation periods observed in light curves. Additionally, good consistency is
found between our periods and those of SB1 systems in Gaia data. These orbital
solutions contribute to understanding binary star evolution and the statistical
properties of binary populations.

### [16] [Anharmonic infrared spectra of cationic pyrene and superhydrogenated derivatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11898)
*Zeyuan Tang,Frederik G. Doktor,Rijutha Jaganathan,Julianna Palotás,Jos Oomens,Liv Hornekær,Bjørk Hammer*

**TL;DR**: The study investigates the anharmonicity in IR spectra of superhydrogenated pyrene, comparing theoretical and experimental spectra to understand interstellar dust properties in the JWST era.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Understanding the vibrational features and chemical properties of interstellar dust, particularly in the JWST era, requires studying the anharmonicity in IR spectra of PAHs at elevated temperatures.

Data: Theoretical IR spectra from classical molecular dynamics simulations and experimental IR spectra from gas-phase action spectroscopy (IRMPD) are used.

Method: Classical molecular dynamics simulations accelerated by a machine learning interatomic potential are compared with experimental IR spectra obtained via IRMPD.

Result: The harmonic approximation works for pristine and partially superhydrogenated pyrene cations, but an MD-based anharmonic treatment is needed for fully superhydrogenated pyrene. Temperature effects on band shifts and broadenings are also detailed.

Abstract: Studying the anharmonicity in the infrared (IR) spectra of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at elevated temperatures is important to
understand vibrational features and chemical properties of interstellar dust,
especially in the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) era. We take pyrene as an
example PAH and investigate how different degrees of superhydrogenation affects
the applicability of the harmonic approximation and the role of temperature in
IR spectra of PAHs. This is achieved by comparing theoretical IR spectra
generated by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental IR
spectra obtained via gas-phase action spectroscopy which utilizes the Infrared
Multiple Photon Dissociation (IRMPD). All simulations are accelerated by a
machine learning interatomic potential, in order to reach first principle
accuracies while keeping low computational costs. We have found that the
harmonic approximation with empirical scaling factors is able to reproduce
experimental band profile of pristine and partially superhydrogenated pyrene
cations. However, a MD-based anharmonic treatment is mandatory in the case of
fully superhydrogenated pyrene cation for matching theory and experiment. In
addition, band shifts and broadenings as the temperature increases are
investigated in detail. Those findings may aid in the interpretation of JWST
observations on the variations in band positions and widths of interstellar
dust.
