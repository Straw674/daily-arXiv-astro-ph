### [1] [What goes around comes around: the fate of stars in stripped tails of gas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11526)

**TL;DR**: 通过高分辨率风洞模拟研究两个大质量星系在随时间演化的冲压剥离过程中剥离尾部内的原位恒星形成，发现尾部恒星主要形成于剥离初期靠近星系盘的位置，且其年龄、速度和金属丰度反映了外部剥离和ICM混合的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究背景聚焦于大质量星系（$M_\text{star}=10^{11}M_\odot$）在冲压剥离过程中剥离尾部内的恒星形成现象，探讨了剥离角度（正面剥离W0和倾斜剥离W45）对恒星形成的影响。

Data: 研究使用了高分辨率风洞模拟数据，分析了两个星系（W0和W45）在剥离过程中的恒星形成情况。

Method: 采用高分辨率风洞模拟方法，模拟了随时间演化的冲压剥离过程，并研究了尾部恒星的形成位置、年龄、速度和金属丰度。

Result: 研究发现尾部恒星主要形成于剥离初期靠近星系盘的位置，年龄分布反映了外部剥离模式；ICM混合导致恒星速度和金属丰度的变化；部分恒星（15--25%）具有负速度，表明气体回落到星系；尾部恒星对星系内光贡献可忽略，但其轨道导致星系周围不对称的恒星分布。

Abstract: We conduct high-resolution wind-tunnel simulations to study in-situ star
formation in the stripped tails of two massive ($M_\text{star}=10^{11}M_\odot$)
galaxies undergoing time-evolving ram-pressure stripping: one is stripped
face-on (W0) and the other is subject to an angled wind (W45). We find that the
majority of stars in the tail are formed close to the galaxy disc at the
beginning of stripping. Most stars have ages that reflect outside-in stripping
-- older stars are found at larger radii than younger stars. The velocities and
metallicities of stars indicate that ICM mixing both increases the velocity and
decreases the metallicity of star-forming gas, leading to faster, lower
metallicity stars at larger distances from the galaxies. However, not all stars
follow this simple model, even in the case of face-on stripping. Indeed, a
considerable number (15--25 per cent) of tail stars are formed with negative
velocities, indicating the fallback of star-forming gas on to the galaxy.
Almost all of the tail stars formed within 20 kpc from the disc will eventually
fall back on to the galaxy, and their contribution to the intracluster light is
negligible. The orbits of the stars formed in the tail result in an extended
(and asymmetric in the case of W45) stellar distribution around the disc. Mock
UV images reveal that the observed vertical distribution of its stars is not
significantly broader than in an undisturbed galaxy, indicating that more stars
would need to form in the stripped tail than we find in our simulations to
observably impact the UV disc width of ram pressure stripped galaxies.

### [2] [Oxyster: A Circumgalactic Low-ionization Oxygen Nebula next to a Starburst Galaxy at $z\sim1$](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11531)
*Pengjun Lu,Mingyu Li,Dalya Baron,Minghao Yue,Song Huang,Zheng Cai*

**TL;DR**: Researchers discovered a large ionized nebula, "Oxyster," near an interacting starburst galaxy at z=0.924, challenging typical AGN light echo explanations and suggesting a combination of recent starburst and low-luminosity AGN activity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Extended emission line nebulae around galaxies or AGNs offer insights into the circumgalactic medium (CGM), but Oxyster's properties differ from typical AGN light echoes, indicating a unique case.

Data: Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam narrow-band imaging, spectroscopic follow-up, HST and JWST images, X-ray non-detection, and radio continuum data.

Method: Narrow-band imaging, spectroscopic analysis, spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, and comparison with photoionization and shock models.

Result: Oxyster exhibits extended [OII] and [OIII] emission lines, low O32 ratio, and non-detection of Hβ, suggesting a recent starburst and low-luminosity AGN activity, though its nature remains unclear.

Abstract: Extended emission line nebulae around galaxies or active galactic nuclei
(AGNs) provide a unique window to investigate the galactic ecosystem through
the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Using Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam narrow-band
imaging and spectroscopic follow-up, we serendipitously discover "Oxyster" - a
large ionized nebula next to an interacting starburst galaxy at $z=0.924$. The
nebula is traced by extended [OII]3726,3729 ($\sim 30$ kpc) and [OIII]5007
($\sim 20$ kpc) emission lines. On the nebula luminosity-size plane, Oxyster
surpasses the extended narrow-line regions around low-$z$ AGNs, resembling a
higher-$z$ analog of "Hanny's Voorwerp". However, its uniformly low
[OIII]/[OII] ratio (O32) sets it apart from typical AGN light echoes. For the
host galaxy, HST and JWST images reveal a disturbed red disk galaxy with a
single blue spiral "arm". Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting suggests
the $2-6\times 10^{10} ~\rm M_{\odot}$ host galaxy sits above the star-forming
main sequence with an ongoing starburst, especially in the "arm", and have
$<5\%$ luminosity contribution from AGN, consistent with X-ray non-detection
and radio continuum. Standard photoionization and shock models struggle to
explain simultaneously Oxyster's emission line luminosities, low O32 ratio, and
the non-detection of H$\beta$ line. A plausible explanation could involve the
combination of a recent ($<10^8$ yrs) starburst and a low-luminosity AGN
($L_{\rm{bol}} \sim 1\times10^{42}$ erg/s). While Oxyster's nature awaits
future investigation, its discovery highlights the potential of ground-based
narrow-band imaging to uncover extended emission line nebulae around non-AGN
systems, opening new avenues for studying the CGM of normal galaxies in the
early Universe.

**TL;DR**: 通过分析Gaia Alerts和Gaia Data Release 3数据，研究发现了四个中等至高放大率的微透镜事件，并利用有限源效应约束了透镜的质量下限，表明这些透镜可能是白矮星或中子星等恒星残骸。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 微透镜事件是探测和测量孤立、非发光天体（尤其是暗恒星残骸）质量的独特方法。有限源效应（FS效应）在高度放大的光变曲线中尤为显著，可用于通过光度测量确定天体质量。

Data: Gaia Alerts和Gaia Data Release 3数据集。

Method: 通过分析微透镜光变曲线中的有限源效应，约束角爱因斯坦半径和透镜质量下限，并使用DarkLensCode软件基于银河系模型估计透镜的质量、距离和亮度分布。

Result: 研究确定了四个透镜的质量下限（约0.2-0.5 $M_{\odot}$），DarkLensCode分析进一步支持透镜质量为0.42-1.66 $M_{\odot}$，且暗透镜概率超过60%，表明这些透镜可能是恒星残骸。

Abstract: Microlensing events provide a unique way to detect and measure the masses of
isolated, non-luminous objects, particularly dark stellar remnants. Under
certain conditions, it is possible to measure the mass of these objects using
photometry alone, specifically when a microlensing light curve displays a
finite-source (FS) effect. This effect generally occurs in highly magnified
light curves, i.e. when the source and the lens are very well aligned. In this
study, we analyse Gaia Alerts and Gaia Data Release 3 datasets, identifying
four moderate-to-high-magnification microlensing events without a discernible
FS effect. The absence of this effect suggests a large Einstein radius,
implying substantial lens masses. In each event, we constrain the FS effect and
therefore establish lower limits for angular Einstein radius and lens mass.
Additionally, we use the DarkLensCode software to obtain mass, distance, and
brightness distribution for the lens based on the Galactic model. Our analysis
established lower mass limits of $\sim 0.2$ $M_{\odot}$ for one lens and $\sim
0.3-0.5$ $M_{\odot}$ for two others. DarkLensCode analysis supports these
findings, estimating lens masses in the range of$\sim 0.42-1.66$ $M_{\odot}$
and dark lens probabilities exceeding 60\%. These results strongly indicate
that the lenses are stellar remnants, such as white dwarfs or neutron stars.
While further investigations are required to confirm the nature of these
lenses, we demonstrate a straightforward yet effective approach to identifying
stellar remnant candidates.

### [4] [Tracking the assembly of supermassive black holes: a comparison of diverse models across cosmic time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11566)
*Antonio J. Porras-Valverde,Angelo Ricarte,Priyamvada Natarajan,Rachel S. Somerville,Austen Gabrielpillai,L. Y. Aaron Yung*

**TL;DR**: The study compares semi-analytic models (SAMs) of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth, highlighting discrepancies with observations and identifying unique predictions of the Dark Sage model, including super-Eddington accretion and alignment with high-redshift AGN data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Galaxies and their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) co-evolve, but the mechanisms and details of this process remain unclear, with significant differences among modeling frameworks.

Data: The study uses semi-analytic models (SAMs) to trace SMBH mass assembly across a range of masses ($M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{6-10}, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) and compares results with observations, including JWST data at $z=4-5$.

Method: The research employs a suite of semi-analytic models (SAMs) to analyze SMBH mass assembly, focusing on discrepancies between models and observations, and examines the unique features of the Dark Sage model, such as super-Eddington accretion.

Result: Discrepancies exist between physics-based models and observations of the local black hole mass function (BHMF), but models generally agree at $z \sim 1-4$ and align with JWST data at $z=4-5$. The Dark Sage model predicts a unique "knee" in the AGN luminosity function, consistent with high-redshift "Little Red Dots," and shows SMBHs grow primarily through secular disk instabilities and cold gas accretion.

Abstract: Galaxies grow alongside their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs),
linked through fueling and feedback. However, the origins and details of this
co-evolution remain unclear and differ significantly amongst modeling
frameworks. Using a suite of semi-analytic models (SAMs), we trace SMBH mass
assembly across $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{6-10}, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. We find
significant discrepancies between observations and physics-based models of the
local black hole mass function (BHMF), likely due to differences in the
underlying stellar mass function and the scaling relations therefrom used to
infer the BHMF. However, most physics-based models agree at $z \sim 1-4$ and
align reasonably well with broad-line AGN BHMF from JWST observations at
$z=4-5$. Most physics-based models reproduce the bolometric AGN luminosity
evolution, except {\sc Dark Sage}, which predicts an excess deviating from
models and observations. Interestingly, this pronounced ``knee' in the
bolometric AGN luminosity function predicted by {\sc Dark Sage} around $L_{\rm
bol} \sim 10^{46} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}}$ is consistent with the inferred
luminosity of ``Little Red Dots'' at $z=5-6$, assuming that their entire
emission originates from AGN activity. We analyze black hole mass build-up and
accretion histories in {\sc Dark Sage}, which, unlike other models, allows for
super-Eddington accretion. We report that on average, SMBHs in {\sc Dark Sage}
primarily grow through secular disk instabilities and merger-driven cold gas
accretion, while black hole mergers contribute 60\% of the total mass budget
only for the most massive SMBHs by $z=0$.

*Nicholas A. Barth,David Mendez,Rana Ezzeddine,Yuxi,Lu,Leslie M. Morales,Zachary R. Claytor,Jamie Tayar*

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过结合动力学和化学数据评估了化学动力学标记在恢复开放星团中的效果，发现动力学参数表现最佳，但整体恢复率仍较低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 化学动力学标记被提出作为追踪恒星起源的有力工具，但其有效性仍存在争议。

Data: 研究使用了来自Gaia DR3的动力学数据和GALAH DR4的化学数据。

Method: 通过自举分析评估了轨道参数和化学丰度的组合在聚类算法HBDSCAN中的表现。

Result: 动力学参数表现最佳，但恢复率仍较低；通过添加金属丰度、年龄和出生半径的筛选可略微提高恢复率。

Abstract: Chemodynamical tagging has been suggested as a powerful tool to trace stars
back to their birth clusters. However, the efficacy of chemodynamical tagging
as a means to recover individual stellar clusters is still under debate. In
this study, we present a detailed investigation of chemodynamical tagging of
open clusters using both dynamical and chemical data from the \textit{Gaia} DR3
and GALAH DR4 surveys, respectively. Using a sample of open clusters and mock
field stars, we conduct a bootstrap analysis to evaluate every unique
combination of orbital components ($E, J_R, J_\phi, J_Z$) and chemical
abundances ([X/Fe] for O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Y, and
Ba) on how well they recover open clusters when used as parameters in the
clustering algorithm, HBDSCAN. We find that using primarily dynamical orbital
parameters leads to the highest recovery rate of open cluster stars.
Nevertheless, even employing the best performing parameter combinations leads
to low open cluster recovery rates. We find that, in most cases, chemodynamical
tagging of open clusters using blind clustering algorithms is not efficient,
which is in line with previous theoretical and observational work. However, we
show that the addition of cuts based on metallicity, age, and birth radii in
order to reduce the size of the clustering catalog can marginally improve the
recovery rate of open clusters.

*Oliver Müller,Helmut Jerjen,Salvatore Taibi,Nick Heesters,Ethan Crosby,Marcel S. Pawlowski*

**TL;DR**: 通过深空成像活动发现了11个新的低表面亮度矮星系候选体，并验证了它们的形态和光度特性符合已知的尺度关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 本地宇宙中仍存在大量未被发现的矮星系，通过深空成像活动可以揭示这些隐藏的天体。

Data: 使用Subaru Hyper Suprime Camera对M106、NGC2903、NGC3521和UGCA127等孤立明亮宿主星系周围的矮星系进行观测。

Method: 基于视觉检查发现矮星系候选体，并通过人工星系实验验证观测的完整性。

Result: 发现了11个新的矮星系候选体，验证了它们符合已知的尺度关系，并追踪了这些星系的光度函数至V波段≈−9星等。

Abstract: The local universe is still full of hidden dwarf galaxies to be discovered
using deep imaging campaigns. Here we present the third paper in a series to
search for low-surface brightness dwarf galaxies around nearby isolated
luminous host galaxies with the Subaru Hyper Suprime Camera. Based on visual
inspection, we found 11, 0, 4, and 6 dwarf galaxy candidates around M106,
NGC2903, NGC3521, and UGCA127, respectively. This adds to the 40 candidates
around M104 and 4 candidates around NGC2683 found in the previous papers.
Artificial galaxy experiments show that we are complete down to a mean
effective surface brightness of 26 mag/arcsec$^2$. The new dwarf galaxy
candidates follow known scaling relation in size, surface brightness and
luminosity, making them good candidates based on their morphology and
photometric properties. We trace the luminosity function of these galaxies down
to magnitude of $\approx-$9 in the V band for all galaxies targeted in our
survey footprint so far. While the most massive galaxy (M104) has a significant
higher abundance of dwarfs, NGC3521, NGC2903, and NGC2683 have a similar
luminosity function as the Milky Way. These latter three galaxies also have a
similar stellar mass and might be considered Milky Way analogs. UGCA127 is a
low-mass galaxy but almost reaches the same number of dwarfs as the Milky Way
at our limiting magnitude. We have searched for hints of lopsidedness in the
satellite distributions, but found none to be significant. The next step will
be to confirm these members through either distance or velocity measurements.

### [7] [Examination of the functional form of the light and mass distribution in spiral arms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11642)
*Ilia V. Chugunov,Alexander A. Marchuk,Sergey S. Savchenko*

**TL;DR**: This study measures the mass and light distribution in spiral arms of 19 face-on galaxies using infrared and ultraviolet data, developing a 2D photometric function to analyze arm properties and supporting density wave evidence in NGC 4535.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Spiral arms are common in local galaxies, but their mass and light distribution is not well understood, prompting this detailed study.

Data: Infrared images at 3.6 $\mu$m from the S$^4$G survey and ultraviolet data from GALEX telescope.

Method: The slicing method is used to analyze spiral arms, deriving properties like shape, brightness profile, width variation, skewness, and S\'{e}rsic index.

Result: A 2D photometric function for spiral arms is developed, validated, and applied to support density wave evidence in NGC 4535.

Abstract: Spiral arms are a common feature of local galaxies, but the exact form of the
distribution of mass and light in them is not well known. In this work, we aim
to measure this distribution as accurately as possible, focusing on individual
spiral arms and using the so-called slicing method. The sample consists of 19
well-resolved, viewed face-on spiral galaxies from the S$^4$G survey. We work
primarily with infrared images at 3.6 $\mu$m from the same survey, and,
secondarily, with ultraviolet data from the GALEX telescope. We derive the
properties of the spiral arms step by step, starting from their overall shape,
then measuring their brightness profile and width variation along the arm, and
then examining the fine structure of the profile across the arm, namely its
skewness and S\'{e}rsic index. We construct a 2D photometric function of the
spiral arm that can be used in further decomposition studies, validate it and
identify the most and least important parameters. Finally, we show how our
results can be used to unravel the nature of the spiral arms, supporting the
evidence that NGC 4535 has a density wave in its disc.

**TL;DR**: The paper characterizes the Cocytos stream, a metal-rich and thick stellar stream likely originating from a disrupted globular cluster, using DESI survey data and Magellan/MagE spectroscopy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The census of stellar streams and dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way is crucial for galaxy formation models and dark matter studies.

Data: DESI Milky Way survey data (14,000 deg² footprint, depth of r < 19 mag) and Magellan/MagE spectroscopy.

Method: Clustering analysis with a catalog of giants in DESI year 3 data, supplemented with spectroscopy.

Result: Discovery of the Cocytos stream: metal-rich ([Fe/H] = -1.3), thick (width = 1.5°), at 25 kpc, with velocity dispersion of 6.5-9 km s⁻¹, likely a disrupted globular cluster from the Gaia-Enceladus merger.

Abstract: The census of stellar streams and dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way provides
direct constraints on galaxy formation models and the nature of dark matter.
The DESI Milky Way survey (with a footprint of 14,000$~deg{^2}$ and a depth of
$r<19$ mag) delivers the largest sample of distant metal-poor stars compared to
previous optical fiber-fed spectroscopic surveys. This makes DESI an ideal
survey to search for previously undetected streams and dwarf galaxies. We
present a detailed characterization of the Cocytos stream, which was
re-discovered using a clustering analysis with a catalog of giants in the DESI
year 3 data, supplemented with Magellan/MagE spectroscopy. Our analysis reveals
a relatively metal-rich ([Fe/H]$=-1.3$) and thick stream (width$=1.5^\circ$) at
a heliocentric distance of $\approx 25$ kpc, with an internal velocity
dispersion of 6.5-9 km s$^{-1}$. The stream's metallicity, radial orbit, and
proximity to the Virgo stellar overdensities suggest that it is most likely a
disrupted globular cluster that came in with the Gaia-Enceladus merger. We also
confirm its association with the Pyxis globular cluster. Our result showcases
the ability of wide-field spectroscopic surveys to kinematically discover faint
disrupted dwarfs and clusters, enabling constraints on the dark matter
distribution in the Milky Way.

*Souradeep Bhattacharya,Kanak Saha*

**TL;DR**: The study characterizes the UV luminosity function (UVLF) using AstroSat/UVIT data in GOODS-S, finding consistency with previous results but noting differences in normalization, and reveals a rapid evolution in cosmic star formation history.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The research builds on existing studies of the UVLF using AstroSat/UVIT data, comparing results with previous observations from GOODS-North, GALEX, and HST, while addressing discrepancies in normalization factors.

Data: AstroSat/UVIT F154W and N242W imaging data from the GOODS-S deep field, covering FUV observations at z < 0.13 and NUV observations in seven redshift bins (z ~ 0.8-0.4).

Method: The UVLF is constructed and characterized using fitted Schechter function parameters, with comparisons to literature data.

Result: The UVLF slope and characteristic magnitude align with previous studies, but normalization differences exist. The UV luminosity density trend indicates a rapid rise and decline in cosmic star formation, faster than prior estimates.

Abstract: We characterise the rest-frame 1500 \r{A} UV luminosity Function (UVLF) from
deep AstroSat/UVIT F154W and N242W imaging in the Great Observatories Origins
Survey South (GOODS-S) deep field. The UVLFs are constructed and subsequently
characterised with fitted Schechter function parameters from FUV observations
at z$<0.13$ and NUV observations in seven redshift bins in z~0.8-0.4. The UVLF
slope ($\alpha$) and characteristic magnitude ($M^*$) are consistent with
previous determinations for this redshift range based on AstroSat/UVIT
GOODS-North observations, as well as with those from Galaxy evolution Explorer
and Hubble Space Telescope observations. However, differences in the
normalisation factor ($\phi_{*}$) are present for UVLFs for some redshift bins.
We compute the UV luminosity density, $\rho_{\rm UV}$, combining our determined
UVLF parameters with literature determinations out to z$\sim10$. The $\rho_{\rm
UV}$ trend with redshift implies the rapid increase in cosmic star formation
till its peak at z$\sim3$ (cosmic noon) followed by a slow decline till present
day. Both the initial increase in cosmic star formation and subsequent decline
are found to be more rapid than previous determinations.

**TL;DR**: The study investigates whether a compact dark perturber in the SDSSJ0946+1006 lensing system can be explained by a core-collapsed halo in the self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model, finding inconsistencies with observational data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Previous studies identified an extremely compact dark perturber in the SDSSJ0946+1006 lensing system, challenging the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm.

Data: Observational data from the SDSSJ0946+1006 lensing system and prior Hubble imaging.

Method: The isothermal Jeans method was used to compute density profiles of core-collapsed halos across a range of masses.

Result: A core-collapsed halo with a mass of ~$10^{11}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ fits the data but should host a detectable galaxy, which is not observed, suggesting the SIDM model struggles to explain the perturber.

Abstract: Previous studies, based on precise modeling of a gravitationally lensing
image, have identified what may be a extremely compact, dark perturber in the
well-known lensing system SDSSJ0946+1006 (the "Jackpot"). Its remarkable
compactness challenges the standard cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm. In this
paper, we explore whether such a compact perturber could be explained as a
core-collapsed halo described by the self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model.
Using the isothermal Jeans method, we compute the density profiles of
core-collapsed halos across a range of masses. Our comparison with observations
indicates that only a core-collapsed halo with a total mass of approximately
$10^{11}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ could produce an inner density profile and mass
enclosed within 1 kpc that is consistent with observational data. However, such
a massive dark matter halo should host a galaxy detectable by prior Hubble
imaging, which is not observed. Thus, the core-collapsed SIDM halo model
struggles to fully account for the exotic nature of the "little dark dot" in
the "Jackpot" lens.

Abstract: It is established that there exists a direct link between the formation
history of star cluster populations and their host galaxies, however, our
lacking understanding of star cluster assembly prohibits us to make full use of
their ability to trace galaxy evolution. In this work we introduce a new
variation of the 2020 version of the semi-analytical galaxy formation model
"L-Galaxies" that includes the formation of star clusters above 10^4 M_Sun and
probes different physical assumptions that affect their evolution over cosmic
time. We use properties of different galaxy components and localised star
formation to determine the bound fraction of star formation in disks. After
randomly sampling masses from an environmentally-dependent star cluster initial
mass function, we assign to each object a half-mass radius, metallicity, and
distance from the galaxy centre. We consider up to 2000 individual star
clusters per galaxy and evolve their properties over time taking into account
stellar evolution, two-body relaxation, tidal shocks, dynamical friction, and a
re-positioning during galaxy mergers. Our simulation successfully reproduces
several observational quantities, such as the empirical relationship between
the absolute V -band magnitude of the brightest young star clusters and the
host galaxy star formation rate, the mass function of young star clusters, or
mean metallicities of the star cluster distributions versus galaxy masses. The
simulation reveals great complexity in the z = 0 star cluster population
resulting from differential destruction channels and origins, including in-situ
populations in the disk, a major merger-induced heated component in the halo,
and accreted star clusters. Model variations point out the importance of e.g.
the shape of the star cluster initial mass function or the relationship between
the sound speed of cold gas and the star formation rate.

*Ke Shi,Jun Toshikawa,XianZhong Zheng,Zheng Cai,DongDong Shi*

**TL;DR**: A narrowband imaging study of the protocluster D4UD01 at z=3.24 reveals 24 [O III] emitters, indicating an evolved structure with galaxy populations possibly formed at different epochs.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The study focuses on the protocluster D4UD01 at z=3.24, which is expected to evolve into a Virgo-like cluster by z=0, addressing the spatial and evolutionary differences among galaxy populations within such structures.

Data: Narrowband imaging data from CFHT/WIRCam and multiwavelength data are used to analyze the protocluster.

Method: Narrowband imaging and multiwavelength analysis are employed to identify and study [O III] emitters and their properties.

Result: The protocluster contains 24 [O III] emitters, medium-mass star-forming galaxies, with spatial offsets from other galaxy populations, suggesting different formation epochs for their dark matter halos.

Abstract: We present a narrowband imaging on a spectroscopically confirmed protocluster
``D4UD01'' at z=3.24 using CFHT/WIRCam. We identify a sample of 24 [O III]
emission line galaxies in the field, which forms a large overdensity in the
protocluster region. The protocluster is expected to evolve into a Virgo-like
cluster by z=0. Utilizing multiwavelength data, we derive the physical
properties of these [O III] emitters and find they are medium mass normal
star-forming galaxies ($\sim10^{10}$M$_\odot$) roughly following the
star-forming main sequence. The [O III] emitters trace an overdensity spatially
offset from that of photometric-redshift and quiescent galaxies, suggesting
these distinct galaxy populations may inhabit dark matter halos that formed at
different epochs. A comparative analysis of [O III] emitter properties shows
similar characteristics in both protocluster and field environments. This
protocluster likely represents an evolved structure that has progressed beyond
its peak star-formation phase, although our limited sample size may prevent
detection of subtle environmental effects.

### [13] [How to use Gaia parallaxes for stars with poor astrometric fits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11528)
*Kareem El-Badry*

**TL;DR**: The study quantifies biases in Gaia parallax measurements for high-RUWE stars and provides an empirical method to correct underestimated uncertainties, enabling reliable distance estimates for binary and multiple systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Gaia parallax measurements for stars with high renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) are often assumed unreliable due to biases from binarity or higher-order multiplicity, yet these biases remain poorly quantified.

Data: Simulated Gaia epoch astrometry data, single-star solutions for Gaia sources with known orbital solutions, and wide binaries with one high-RUWE component.

Method: Realistic simulations of Gaia epoch astrometry and empirical derivation of a prescription to inflate reported uncertainties based on RUWE, apparent magnitude, and parallax.

Result: Parallax uncertainties for high-RUWE sources are underestimated by a factor of 1 to 4, and a robust correction method is validated, enabling reliable distance estimates for various astrophysical systems.

Abstract: Gaia parallax measurements for stars with poor astrometric fits -- as
evidenced by high renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) -- are often assumed to
be unreliable, but the extent and nature of their biases remain poorly
quantified. High RUWE is usually a consequence of binarity or higher-order
multiplicity, so the parallaxes of sources with high RUWE are often of greatest
astrophysical interest. Using realistic simulations of Gaia epoch astrometry,
we show that the parallax uncertainties of sources with elevated RUWE are
underestimated by a factor that ranges from 1 to 4 and can be robustly
predicted from observables. We derive an empirical prescription to inflate
reported uncertainties based on a simple analytic function of RUWE, apparent
magnitude, and parallax. We validate the correction using (a) single-star
solutions for Gaia sources with known orbital solutions and (b) wide binaries
containing one component with elevated RUWE. The same uncertainty corrections
are expected to perform well in DR4 and DR5. Our results demonstrate that Gaia
parallaxes for high-RUWE sources can still yield robust distance estimates if
uncertainties are appropriately inflated, enabling distance constraints for
triples, binaries with periods too long or too short to be fit astrometrically,
and sources blended with neighboring sources.

### [14] [ALMASOP. Detection of Turbulence-induced Mass Assembly Shocks in Starless Cores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11776)
*Shih-Ying Hsu,Sheng-Yuan Liu,Xunchuan Liu,Pak Shing Li,Tie Liu,Dipen Sahu,Kenichi Tatematsu,Shanghuo Li,Naomi Hirano,Chin-Fei Lee,Sheng-Jun Lin*

**TL;DR**: ALMA observations reveal anti-correlated CH$_3$OH and N$_2$H$^+$ emissions in starless cores, suggesting shock-induced desorption of icy mantles during core growth in turbulent clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Starless cores are initial seeds of stars, but their origin and growth are poorly understood. Recent CH$_3$OH emission discoveries around these cores remain puzzling.

Data: Sensitive ALMA (Band~3) observations at 3~mm toward newly identified starless cores in the Orion Molecular Cloud.

Method: Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of star formation in turbulent clouds combined with radiative transfer calculations and imaging simulations.

Result: Observed anti-correlated CH$_3$OH and N$_2$H$^+$ emissions, explained by shock-induced desorption of icy mantles, providing insights into starless core growth and complex organic molecules.

Abstract: Star formation is a series of mass assembly processes and starless cores,
those cold and dense condensations in molecular clouds, play a pivotal role as
initial seeds of stars. With only a limited sample of known starless cores,
however, the origin and growth of such stellar precursors had not been well
characterized previously. Meanwhile, the recent discovery of CH$_3$OH emission,
which is generally associated with desorbed icy mantle in warm regions,
particularly at the periphery of starless cores also remains puzzling. We
present sensitive ALMA (Band~3) observations (at 3~mm) toward a sample of newly
identified starless cores in the Orion Molecular Cloud. The spatially resolved
images distinctly indicate that the observed CH$_3$OH and N$_2$H$^+$ emission
associated with these cores are morphologically anti-correlated and
kinematically offset from each other. We postulate that the CH$_3$OH emission
highlights the desorption of icy mantle by shocks resulting from gas piling
onto dense cores in the filaments traced by N$_2$H$^+$. Our magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) simulations of star formation in turbulent clouds combined with radiative
transfer calculations and imaging simulations successfully reproduced the
observed signatures and reaffirmed the above scenario at work. Our result
serves as an intriguing and exemplary illustration, a snapshot in time, of the
dynamic star-forming processes in turbulent clouds. The results offer
compelling insights into the mechanisms governing the growth of starless cores
and the presence of gas-phase complex organic molecules associated with these
cores.

**TL;DR**: The study derived orbital solutions for 665 SB2 binaries using LAMOST-MRS data, employing a modified version of Thejoker, and validated results with Kepler, TESS, and ZTF data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Binary star evolution research is hindered by the limited number of binaries with known orbital parameters.

Data: LAMOST-MRS survey data for 1119 SB2 systems with at least six observations.

Method: A modified version of Thejoker optimized for SB2 binaries, with four selection criteria for reliability.

Result: 665 reliable orbital solutions were obtained, showing good agreement with Kepler, TESS, ZTF, and Gaia data.

Abstract: The period, mass ratio, eccentricity, and other orbital parameters are
fundamental for investigating binary star evolution. However, the number of
binaries with known orbital parameters remains limited. Utilizing the
LAMOST-MRS survey, we derived orbital solutions for 665 SB2 binaries by fitting
the radial velocities of 1119 SB2 systems with at least six observations,
employing a modified version of Thejoker optimized for SB2 binaries. To ensure
the reliability of the results, four selection criteria were applied: reduced
chi-square, normalized mean absolute error, maximum phase gap, and RV
distribution metric. After applying these criteria, 665 reliable orbits were
retained. Comparison with Kepler, TESS, and ZTF light curve data shows
excellent agreement, with discrepancies in some cases attributed to shorter
pulsation periods observed in light curves. Additionally, good consistency is
found between our periods and those of SB1 systems in Gaia data. These orbital
solutions contribute to understanding binary star evolution and the statistical
properties of binary populations.

### [16] [Anharmonic infrared spectra of cationic pyrene and superhydrogenated derivatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11898)
*Zeyuan Tang,Frederik G. Doktor,Rijutha Jaganathan,Julianna Palotás,Jos Oomens,Liv Hornekær,Bjørk Hammer*

**TL;DR**: The study explores the anharmonicity in IR spectra of superhydrogenated pyrene, comparing harmonic approximation and molecular dynamics simulations to experimental data, revealing insights for JWST observations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Understanding the anharmonicity in IR spectra of PAHs is crucial for interpreting interstellar dust features, especially with JWST's capabilities. Current research lacks detailed analysis of superhydrogenation effects and temperature roles.

Data: Theoretical IR spectra from molecular dynamics simulations and experimental IR spectra via gas-phase action spectroscopy (IRMPD) are used.

Method: Classical molecular dynamics simulations accelerated by a machine learning interatomic potential are compared to experimental IR spectra.

Result: Harmonic approximation works for pristine and partially superhydrogenated pyrene, but anharmonic treatment is needed for fully superhydrogenated pyrene. Temperature effects on band shifts and broadenings are detailed.

Abstract: Studying the anharmonicity in the infrared (IR) spectra of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at elevated temperatures is important to
understand vibrational features and chemical properties of interstellar dust,
especially in the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) era. We take pyrene as an
example PAH and investigate how different degrees of superhydrogenation affects
the applicability of the harmonic approximation and the role of temperature in
IR spectra of PAHs. This is achieved by comparing theoretical IR spectra
generated by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental IR
spectra obtained via gas-phase action spectroscopy which utilizes the Infrared
Multiple Photon Dissociation (IRMPD). All simulations are accelerated by a
machine learning interatomic potential, in order to reach first principle
accuracies while keeping low computational costs. We have found that the
harmonic approximation with empirical scaling factors is able to reproduce
experimental band profile of pristine and partially superhydrogenated pyrene
cations. However, a MD-based anharmonic treatment is mandatory in the case of
fully superhydrogenated pyrene cation for matching theory and experiment. In
addition, band shifts and broadenings as the temperature increases are
investigated in detail. Those findings may aid in the interpretation of JWST
observations on the variations in band positions and widths of interstellar
dust.
