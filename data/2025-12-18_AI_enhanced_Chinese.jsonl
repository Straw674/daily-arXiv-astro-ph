Hydrodynamical simulations suggest a backsplash population of galaxies that have been environmentally stripped by interactions with a host and ejected from the system, though they have not yet been definitively observed in the local universe. Considering their quenched stellar populations, indicated by the lack of coincident GALEX emission, relative distances, and fitting models, the galaxies are consistent with a backsplash origin and are pending follow-up. Analysis is performed to test whether the system's population can be explained by standard cosmology. A potential correlation is found between satellite abundances and halo masses calibrated by tidal indices in a sample of nearby MW-like galaxies, suggesting the importance of environmental density in the formation of dark matter subhaloes, though a larger sample is required.

However, some recent JWST studies have shown the existence of a population of dwarf galaxies with an unexpectedly large dust attenuation. Using the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science Survey (CEERS) data, we identified a sample of 1361 highly extincted low-mass (HELM) galaxies, defined as dwarf galaxies ($M_*<10^{8.5}$) with Av>1mag or more massive galaxies with an exceptionally high dust attenuation given their stellar mass (i.e., $Av>1.6log_{10}(M_*/Mo)-12.6$). The selection is performed using the multiparameter distribution obtained through a comprehensive spectral energy distribution fitting analysis, based on optical to near-infrared data. After excluding possible contaminants, like brown dwarfs, little red dots, high-z (z>8.5) and ultra-high-z (z>15) galaxies, the sample mainly includes sources at z<1, with a tail extending up to z=7.2. The sample has a median stellar mass of $10^7$ Mo and a median dust attenuation of Av=2mag. We analysed the morphology, environment and star-formation rate of these sources to investigate the reason of their large dust attenuation. In particular, HELM sources have sizes (effective radii, Re) similar to non-dusty dwarf galaxies and no correlation is visible between the axis ratios (b/a) and the dust attenuation. This findings indicate that it is unlikely that the large dust attenuation is due to projection effects, but a prolate or a disk-on oblate geometry are still possible, at least for a subsample of the sources. We have found that the distribution of HELM sources is slightly skewed toward more clustered environments than non-dusty dwarfs and tend to be slightly less star forming. This finding, if confirmed by spectroscopic follow-up, indicates that HELM sources could be going through some environmental processes, such as galaxy interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "基于CEERS数据发现1361个高消光低质量星系（HELM），其异常高尘埃消光（中值Av=2mag）与投影效应无关，可能由星系相互作用等环境过程导致。", "background": "研究聚焦于恒星形成星系（star-forming galaxies）中尘埃含量与恒星质量（stellar mass）的正相关性，并探讨矮星系（dwarf galaxies）中异常高尘埃衰减（dust attenuation）现象的成因。", "data": "数据来源于宇宙演化早期发布科学调查（CEERS）的光学至近红外数据，通过全面的光谱能量分布拟合分析获得多参数分布用于样本选择。", "method": "基于光学至近红外数据，采用综合光谱能量分布（SED）拟合分析获得多参数分布进行样本筛选。", "result": "发现了一类具有异常高尘埃衰减（Av>1mag）的矮星系（HELM星系），其分布偏向于比非尘埃矮星系更密集的环境且恒星形成率略低，暗示环境过程（如星系相互作用）可能是其高尘埃衰减的原因。"}}

Submitted to A&A", "summary": "The recent discovery of a large population of overmassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe challenges the validity of the BH-host galaxy coevolution framework. However, the reliability of the estimated BH masses (M$_{BH}$) is being questioned, as these are typically derived using single-epoch (SE) relations calibrated locally. Calibrating SE relations at high redshift would therefore enable more accurate M$_{BH}$ estimates and help identify potential biases. In this work, we release a data-reduction technique for JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations that doubles the effective wavelength coverage, enabling detection of otherwise inaccessible emission. Whenever adjacent dispersers are required, observers should carefully evaluate the tradeoff between integrating longer in the bluer configuration alone versus distributing the exposure time across two dispersers. We apply this pipeline to a sample of 5 quasars at z~2 with M$_{BH}$ independently measured through reverberation mapping (RM). This enables a joint analysis of both H$β$ and H$α$; the latter lying beyond the nominal wavelength range. We assess the reliability of the most widely adopted SE calibrations, finding that H$β$ yields the closest agreement with RM-based M$_{BH}$ estimates, whereas H$α$-based estimators exhibit a larger scatter. For the least massive BH in our sample ($M_{BH,RM}$~$10^{7.5}M_\\odot$), which is accreting at a rate close to the Eddington limit ($λ_{Edd}=0.8$), all SE calibrators overestimate M$_{\\rm BH, RM}$ by one order of magnitude. This may indicate a systematic overestimation of M$_{BH}$ for highly accreting BHs at high redshift. Finally, we provide the first high-redshift SE calibration based on H$α$ and H$β$.

Many of these open problems are encoded in the detailed morphology of the Gaia HR diagram, where precise spectroscopic characterization is essential for interpreting the underlying physical processes. Spectroscopic characterization, obtainable with current and future ESO facilities, can provide the effective temperatures and surface gravities that are required to derive accurate white dwarf masses, cooling ages, and luminosities. These fundamental parameters not only enable studies of spectral evolution, interior physics, and the origin of magnetic and high-mass white dwarfs, but also guarantee the construction of robust mass distributions and luminosity functions, essential for constraining the initial-to-final mass relation, probing the initial mass function, and reconstructing the star formation history of the local Galaxy, among other applications.

Their formation is typically attributed to a head-on collision of a massive galaxy with a compact satellite (intruder), triggering density waves that, propagating outward, produce the characteristic ring morphology. Here, we present the discovery and detailed analysis of GS18660, the most distant ring galaxy known to date, at z=3.08, identified in JWST/NIRSpec IFS observations as part of the GA-NIFS programme. This work aims to characterise the physical and dynamical properties of GS18660 and shed light into the formation of its ring. Specifically, we analyse the ionized gas properties, stellar populations, and gas kinematics of the system, and use the observed geometry to constrain the timescale of the collision. Our analysis is based on NIRSpec IFS data, including low-resolution (R~100) spectroscopy covering ~0.2-1.3um rest-frame, and high-resolution (R~2700) spectroscopy covering 0.4-0.8um rest-frame. Multi-wavelength techniques are applied to derive nebular gas conditions and stellar population properties. Gas kinematic analysis reveals that GS18660 exhibits a rotating disk component with an additional radial expansion velocity of ~200 km/s, consistent with a propagating collisional wave. Nebular line diagnostics indicate intense star formation (SFR ~100 Msun/yr) along the ring and in the nucleus. Stellar population analysis shows that the most recent star formation episode, occurring within the last ~50 Myr, predominantly took place in the ring.

Consequently, age-dependent relations - such as the age-metallicity and age-velocity dispersion relations of the Milky Way, or the age-rotation-activity relation of low-mass stars - are subject to potentially large uncertainties, despite the well-defined trends observed at the population level. White dwarfs, the most common stellar remnants, follow a relatively simple and well-understood cooling process. When found in wide binary systems with main-sequence companions, they can therefore provide the much-needed precise age estimates. The total age of such systems depends not only on the white dwarf cooling time but also on the lifetime of the main-sequence progenitor. Estimating this lifetime requires knowledge of the progenitor mass, which is typically inferred by adopting an initial-to-final mass relation. However, the observational constraints on this relation are still poorly defined, introducing a source of uncertainty in white dwarf age determinations. To mitigate this issue, we focus on a large sample of massive white dwarfs (>~0.7 Msun), for which the main-sequence progenitor lifetime is negligible.

We determine what can drive an $α$-bimodality of the disc in a zoom-in hydrodynamical simulated galaxy which has had no major mergers and negligible radial migration. Using a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the FIRE-2 suite of simulations, we analyse gas flows in the disc together with its star formation and merger history, as well as the chemical evolution of the hot corona, to investigate their connection to transitions in the chemo-dynamical structure of the stellar disc and its radial distribution. The simulated galaxy exhibits high and low-$α$ sequences without having experienced major mergers nor significant radial migration. A high-$α$ thick disc forms during the early chaotic clustering phase. Afterwards, as the star formation rate declines, a dip in the stellar number density appears, coinciding with the dilution of the galactic corona by a minor merger, which subsequently halts the rise of [Fe/H] in the disc. Later, accreted gas onto the disc from minor mergers, mildly enhances the star formation rate and generates the low-$α$ sequence in the outer disc, with radial inward flows of this material feeding the low-$α$ inner disc. Furthermore, we find that even at fixed radii, newly formed stars retain a sizable spread in their chemical abundances, reflecting chemical differences between the in-situ and the infalling gas from which they formed, further indicating that instantaneous gas mixing is invalid.

Specifically, we use Basilisk, a Bayesian hierarchical tool for forward modeling the kinematics and abundance of satellite galaxies extracted from spectroscopic data, to first constrain the galaxy-halo connection precisely and accurately. We then demand self-consistency in that the galaxy-halo connection predicts the correct galaxy luminosity function, which constrains the halo mass function and thereby cosmology. Crucially, the method accounts for baryonic effects and is free of halo assembly bias issues. We validate the method against realistic SDSS-like mock data, demonstrating unbiased recovery of the input cosmology. Applying it to the SDSS-DR7, we infer that $Ω_{\\rm m} = 0.324 \\pm 0.012$, $σ_8 = 0.775 \\pm 0.063$ and $S_8 \\equiv σ_8 \\sqrt{Ω_{\\rm m}/0.3} = 0.81 \\pm 0.05$, in perfect agreement with the cosmic microwave background constraints from Planck.

Hence, unlike many low-redshift analyses of large-scale structure data, we find no indication of $S_8$ tension.

These observables encode the combined effects of early dissipative star formation, subsequent accretion and mergers, and internal feedback processes.

They are likely massive, heavily dust-obscured star-forming galaxies (SFGs) that substantially contribute to the cosmic SFR density at z > 3. To identify drivers of their high dust attenuation and their role in early universe galaxy evolution, we analyse the stellar morphology of 65 OFGs (from 1892 SFGs at 3<z<4) using NIRCAM/F444W imaging from the PRIMER and CEERS fields. We study correlations between dust attenuation ($A_{v}$) and galaxy properties, like stellar mass, size, and orientation, and compare scaling relations between OFGs and typical SFGs. We find that OFGs are ~8-9 times more massive and ~4 times more dust attenuated than the parent sample. Structurally, OFGs resemble parent SFGs in median $R_e$ and median $Σ_{R_e}$ but may be slightly rounder on average. While $A_v$ strongly correlates with stellar mass, it does not show significant dependence on stellar mass-normalised effective radius and stellar mass surface density, Sérsic index, axis ratio, or SFR surface density. The mass-size and mass-surface density relations place OFGs as a higher-mass extension of SFGs, with no concrete proof of evolutionary differences between them. This suggests that OFGs are heavily dust-obscured primarily due to their high stellar masses, which facilitates dust production and retention, with older stellar populations likely contributing as well. Although some OFGs exhibit high $Σ_\\mathrm{R_e}$ and occupy regions of the mass-size plane similar to quiescent galaxies, the overall sample is not representative of this.

In this study, we propose a self-supervised method called contrastive learning to upgrade the unsupervised machine learning (UML) part of the \\texttt{USmorph} framework, aiming to improve the efficiency of feature extraction in this step. The upgraded UML method primarily consists of the following three aspects. (1) We employ a Convolutional Autoencoder to denoise galaxy images and the Adaptive Polar Coordinate Transformation to enhance the model's rotational invariance. (2) A pre-trained dual-encoder convolutional neural network based on ConvNeXt and ViT is used to encode the image data, while contrastive learning is then applied to reduce the dimension of the features.

We compare these methods to un-nulled (or standard) cosmic shear at the data vector level and assess whether these methods are able to reduce the bias on cosmological constraints using a Fisher forecast. We find that the nulling techniques considered can have a large impact on reducing the bias on $S_8$ and Dark Energy parameters. The cross-correlation method is effective at reducing biases in $S_8$, but requires additional information from galaxy clustering.

In addition, we used archival near-infrared spectra to assess the dominant excitation mechanism of OI 8446. We detect, for the first time, variability in OI 8446 on day timescales. The fractional rms amplitude is $\\sim 4$% over the 4-week campaign.

We find clear differences in the properties of the HII regions between the nuclear disc, the bar and the disc, that could be explained by an enhancement in the molecular gas concentration in the central parts driven by bar-induced gas flows. As this gas is channelled towards the galaxy centre, the most extreme values in the analysed properties are found for the circumnuclear HII regions.

These changes arise from two mechanisms: churning, which modifies angular momentum, and blurring, which induces eccentric orbits without major angular momentum change. To assess whether churning or blurring dominates the dynamical evolution of Gaia-ESO stars, we refine Galactic chemical-evolution models by constructing finer grids that span a wider age range. Using a generalised additive model (GAM), we estimate stellar birth radii beyond the limits of binned metallicity models and compare them with dynamical parameters derived from Gaia parallaxes and proper motions, and Galpy. Our metallicity-stratified sample, grouped through hierarchical clustering of 21 chemical abundances, reveals clear migratory signatures: metal-rich stars formed in the inner disc preferentially move outwards, while more metal-poor stars formed at larger radii tend to migrate inwards.

The idea is that the number of strongly lensed GW events and the distribution of their lensing time delays encode imprints of the cosmological parameters. From the observed number of lensed GW events (tens of thousands) and their time delay distribution, this method can provide a new probe of cosmology, obtaining information at intermediate redshifts. In this work, we explore the possibility of doing lensing cosmography using upcoming observations of the upgraded LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. This requires incorporating the detector network selection effects in the analysis, which was neglected earlier. We expect dozens of lensed GW events to be detected by upgraded LVK detectors, potentially enabling modest constraints on cosmological parameters.

Finally, white dwarf binaries play a crucial role in influencing star formation and chemical evolution of the Galaxy by injecting energy into, and enriching, the interstellar medium with material ejected during nova eruptions and SN Ia explosions. In the next decade, the advent of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) at the Vera Rubin Observatory will lead to the discovery of hundreds of thousands of white dwarf binaries.

For stars in particular, surface magnetism polarization that can be detected and measured with spectro-polarimetry. Many questions about these surface fields remain unanswered due to a lack of dedicated instruments capable of probing weak and strong surface magnetic fields for the entire mass range of stars, from M-dwarfs (and even substellar objects) to massive O-type stars at different evolutionary stages and metallicities. These questions range from the origin of these fields to their true incidence rate throughout the stellar population and the dependence on metallicity. Magnetic fields, although currently often excluded from stellar evolution models, play an important role in stellar evolution. Connecting the surface fields to internal fields through asteroseismology will instigate a new era of understanding stellar evolution and the transport of angular momentum and chemical elements throughout stellar interiors, also impacting our understanding of star-planet interactions and stellar remnants. Polarimetry is also an under-utilized tool to observationally constrain the mode identification of nonradial oscillations, which lies at the basis of accurate asteroseismic parameter estimation at percentage-level for stellar radii, masses, ages, internal rotation, and magnetic field strengths. Combining strong constraints on mode identification and surface magnetic properties through the acquisition of time-resolved, high-resolution and high-signal-to-noise (S/N) spectro-polarimetry and spectroscopy promises to bring leaps forward in our understanding of stellar structure, particularly when combined with long-term space photometric data from past, current, and future missions.", "AI": {"tldr": "该论文提出利用高分辨率、高信噪比（S/N）的时域分光偏振测量（spectro-polarimetry）结合星震学（asteroseismology）研究恒星（从M型矮星到O型星）表面磁场特性与非径向振荡模式，以揭示恒星内部磁场结构、角动量传输及化学元素混合机制，推动恒星演化模型的发展。", "background": "恒星表面磁场（surface magnetism polarization）的偏振观测及其对恒星演化、角动量传输和化学元素混合的影响是研究的核心科学主题。", "data": "数据来源为时间分辨的高分辨率、高信噪比（S/N）光谱偏振测量（spectro-polarimetry）和光谱数据，并结合过去、现在及未来任务的长期空间测光数据。", "method": "采用高分辨率、高信噪比(S/N)的时间分辨光谱偏振测量(spectro-polarimetry)结合星震学(asteroseismology)分析恒星表面磁场与内部磁场的关联。", "result": "偏振测量（polarimetry）是研究恒星表面磁场（surface magnetism）及其对恒星演化、角动量传输和化学元素混合影响的关键工具，结合高分辨率时域光谱偏振观测与空间测光数据可显著提升对恒星内部结构的认识。"}}

While recent simulations suggest that stream dissipation occurs rapidly, how the weakly bound debris subsequently loses its thermal energy to assemble a compact disk near the circularization radius remains uncertain. We investigate this cooling process using axisymmetric radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of quasi-hydrostatic 'TDE envelopes', initialized with the total mass, angular momentum, and binding energy expected from a complete stellar disruption. The envelopes, supported by radiation pressure on large scales and rotation near the circularization radius, evolve through a combination of radiative diffusion, turbulent mixing, and polar outflows. In our fiducial model, a quasi-steady state is achieved in which a polar outflow radiates and expels matter at several times the Eddington luminosity. This enables the envelope to cool and contract, forming a dense, rotationally supported ring near the circularization radius, but on a timescale roughly ten times shorter than the naive photon-diffusion timescale. Comparative models without radiation transport confirm that cooling, not purely adiabatic evolution, is essential to driving this rapid inflow. Nevertheless, across a range of envelope masses, the effective envelope cooling time scales only weakly with its optical depth, implying that advective and wind-driven energy transport dominate over diffusion. Our results demonstrate the cooling-induced contraction, even absent viscosity and associated black hole accretion, can produce luminosities and large photosphere radii consistent with early UV/optical TDE emission.

Each 1D-RCE model assumes heat redistribution in the planet's atmosphere consistent with that in the corresponding 3D-GCM's photosphere. Comparing corresponding models, the dayside average pressure-temperature (PT) structures can be broken into four vertical regions, each influencing wavelength-dependent differences in their spectra. Furthermore, the dayside average 3D-GCM PTs for planets with Teq=1400 K exhibit a temperature inversion, whereas corresponding 1D-RCE models do not. We find that spectral differences between 1D-RCE models and 3D-GCMs with the same parameters decrease for hotter planets because the spectral shapes more closely resemble blackbodies. To a lesser extent, spectral differences increase for planets with longer rotation periods because of smaller day-night temperature contrasts in the photosphere.

We found that the optimal GPTA energy range runs about 0.1 to 5 GeV, but we also examined Compton/MeV instruments. With the caveat that the MSP spectra models are extrapolated beyond observational constraints, we found low signal-to-background ratios, yielding few MSP detections. GeV-band concepts would detect 10$^3$ to 10$^4$ MSPs and achieve GW sensitivity on par with and surpassing the current generation of radio PTAs, reaching the GW self-noise regime. When considering two possible scenarios for the formation of MSPs in the Galactic bulge, the collective signal from which is a potential source of an excess GeV signal observed towards the Galactic center, we find that most of the concepts can both detect this bulge population and distinguish the production channel. In summary, the high discovery potential, strong GW performance, and tremendous synergy with radio PTAs all argue for the pursuit of next-generation gamma-ray pulsar timing.", "AI": {"tldr": "通过模拟银河系毫秒脉冲星（MSP）群体并开发高保真伽马射线光谱预测方法，研究发现下一代伽马射线脉冲星计时阵（GPTA）在0.1-5 GeV能段可探测10^3-10^4个MSP，其引力波（GW）灵敏度与当前射电脉冲星计时阵（PTA）相当甚至更优，并能区分银河系核球区域MSP群体的形成机制。", "background": "该研究聚焦于利用毫秒脉冲星（MSPs）的伽马射线脉冲星计时阵（GPTA）探测纳赫兹引力波（nHz GWs），并评估其在下一代伽马射线天文台中的性能潜力。", "data": "研究中使用的数据来源包括费米大面积望远镜（Fermi LAT）对约100颗毫秒脉冲星（MSPs）的全天监测数据，以及通过模拟银河系MSPs群体生成的高保真伽马射线光谱预测数据。", "method": "采用伽马射线能谱预测方法模拟银河系毫秒脉冲星（MSP）群体，并结合费米大面积望远镜（LAT）观测数据验证模型准确性。", "result": "GPTA（伽马射线脉冲星计时阵）在0.1至5 GeV能段表现最优，可探测10^3至10^4颗毫秒脉冲星（MSPs），其引力波（GWs）灵敏度与当前射电PTA相当或更优，并能区分银河系核球区MSPs的不同形成机制。"}}

Accepted by MNRAS", "summary": "Mass-loss from massive stars is fundamental to stellar and galactic evolution and enrichment of the interstellar medium. Reliable determination of mass-loss rate is dependent upon unravelling details of massive star outflows, including optical depth structure of the stellar wind. That parameter introduces significant uncertainty due to the nearly ubiquitous presence of large-scale optically thick wind structure. We utilize suitable available ultraviolet spectra of 20 Large and Small Magellanic Cloud (LMC, SMC) OB stars to extend existing Galactic results quantifying uncertainty inherent in individual observations to lower metallicity environments. This is achieved by measuring standard deviations of mean optical depths of multiple observations of suitable wind-formed absorption profiles as a proportion of their mean optical depths. We confirm earlier findings that wind structure is prevalent at low metallicities and demonstrate that quantifying the consequent uncertainty is to some extent possible, despite the near-complete absence of time series UV spectroscopic observations in those environments. We find that the uncertainty inherent in any single observation of stellar wind optical depth at low metallicity is of similar magnitude to that already identified at Galactic metallicity (up to 45% for cooler OB stars). We further demonstrate how the effect of varying narrow absorption components in wind-formed UV spectral profiles is unlikely to be properly accounted for in existing mass-loss models. We present further evidence of a binary companion to the SMC O-type giant star AzV 75. The importance of obtaining high cadence multi-epoch, or genuine time series, UV spectroscopic observations at low metallicities is highlighted.", "AI": {"tldr": "通过分析大麦哲伦云（LMC）和小麦哲伦云（SMC）20颗OB型恒星的紫外光谱，证实低金属丰度环境下恒星风（stellar wind）普遍存在大尺度光学厚结构（optically thick wind structure），其导致的光学深度（optical depth）观测不确定性（最高达45%）与银河系金属丰度环境相当，并揭示了现有质量损失率（mass-loss rate）模型难以准确处理风形成紫外谱线中窄吸收成分（narrow absorption components）变化的影响。", "background": "研究聚焦于大质量恒星的质量流失（mass-loss）对恒星和星系演化及星际介质（interstellar medium）富集的关键作用，尤其关注恒星风（stellar wind）光学深度结构对质量流失率测定不确定性的影响。", "data": "研究中使用的数据来源于20颗大麦哲伦云（LMC）和小麦哲伦云（SMC）OB型恒星的紫外光谱观测数据。", "method": "采用紫外光谱测量大麦哲伦云（LMC）和小麦哲伦云（SMC）20颗OB型恒星风形成吸收剖面的平均光学深度标准差与均值比例，量化低金属丰度环境下恒星风结构引入的不确定性。", "result": "大质量恒星风（stellar wind）光学深度（optical depth）在低金属丰度环境下的不确定性幅度与银河系金属丰度下已确认的幅度相似（较冷OB星可达45%）。"}}
