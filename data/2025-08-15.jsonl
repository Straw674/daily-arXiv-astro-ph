With CGM gas properties parametrized by the density, velocity, and\ntemperature profiles, a self-shielding calculation is carried out to obtain the\nneutral gas distribution with ionizing photons from the ultraviolet (UV)\nbackground and star formation in the galaxy. Our calculation reveals three\ntypes of systems with distinct neutral gas distribution: non-shielded systems\nwith the CGM being highly ionized across all radii, shielded systems with a\nneutral gas shell shielding the UV background, and transitional systems in\nbetween. Ly$\\alpha$ SB profiles are obtained through Ly$\\alpha$ radiative\ntransfer (RT) simulations, performed for the CGM models with three kinds of\nLy$\\alpha$ sources: the star formation from central and satellite galaxies, and\nthe recombination in the CGM. We build emulators to efficiently predict\nLy$\\alpha$ SB profiles for given model parameters and Ly$\\alpha$ sources, based\non Gaussian process regression. After being trained with only 180 RT\nsimulations for each Ly$\\alpha$ source, the emulators reach an overall accuracy\nat the level of $\\sim 20$ per cent.

The full FDM dynamics are\nimplemented in reionization simulations, along with a new ansatz on modulation\nof the FDM HMF by the linear overdensity. Not only does the suppression of FDM\nhalos on small scales give rise to delay of the signature epochs during cosmic\nreionization, but these epochs are also shortened relative to the cold dark\nmatter cosmology.

The recently discovered Ursa Major III/UNIONS\n1 (UMa3/U1) object, with its measured velocity dispersion, provides a rare\nobservational anchor in this regime. Despite its cluster-like compactness, its\ninferred dynamical mass-to-light ratio (M_dyn/L) suggests a dark\nmatter-dominated nature, prompting interpretations of UMa3/U1 as a microgalaxy,\nthough current measurements remain inconclusive. Thousand-level M_dyn/L values\nare not unique to galaxies; self-gravitating dark star clusters (DSCs) can\nreach comparable levels via energy injection driven by a centrally segregated\nblack hole subsystem (BHSub), which accelerates the evaporation of luminous\nstars and leads to a super-virial appearance with elevated velocity dispersion.\nTo assess whether UMa3/U1 is a DSC, we conducted direct N-body simulations and\nidentified a model that successfully reproduces both its compact structure and\nelevated M_dyn/L, supporting a self-gravitating cluster origin. We find the\ncluster entered the DSC phase around 4 Gyr ago, with its luminous stars\nexpected to be depleted within the next 1 Gyr, followed by the gradual\ndisruption of the central BHSub over the subsequent Gyr. We broaden our\nanalysis by mapping DSC evolutionary tracks in the size versus total luminosity\n(L) and M_dyn/L-L spaces, showing that DSCs occupy a region overlapping with\nfaint, ambiguous satellites. In the M_dyn/L-L diagram, DSCs trace a\ntransitional channel bridging globular clusters and dwarf galaxies as they rise\nfrom M_dyn/L ~ 2 to 10^4 M_sun/L_sun."}

The full FDM dynamics are\nimplemented in reionization simulations, along with a new ansatz on modulation\nof the FDM HMF by the linear overdensity. Not only does the suppression of FDM\nhalos on small scales give rise to delay of the signature epochs during cosmic\nreionization, but these epochs are also shortened relative to the cold dark\nmatter cosmology. In addition, we find that while the FDM effects on the 21-cm\npower spectrum are dominated by its linear dynamics early in Cosmic Dawn, a\ncorrect FDM HMF resulting from nonlinear wave dynamics must be considered when\nX-ray heating begins. We forecast the constraints on the FDM model parameters\nfrom upcoming 21-cm power spectrum measurements by SKA1-Low (central area).

We focus on\nthe Dark Scattering (DS) model, describing pure momentum transfer between dark\nmatter -- dark energy through the parameter $A_{\\rm ds}$. To capture DS\neffects, we adopt the halo model reaction framework within $\\tt{ReACT}$,\ncompute the nonlinear DS spectrum, and validate it against $N$-body\nsimulations. We further include baryonic feedback and massive neutrinos,\nfinding degeneracies between DS and baryonic effects but not with neutrinos.

Growing evidence, however, suggests greater diversity in their\nobserved lightcurves (and spectra) than thought previously. This is usually\nattributed to a variety of WD explosion mechanisms and progenitor system\nproperties, but a direct link between the explosion mechanisms and Type-Ia SN\nobservables remains elusive. Here we present a novel approach to identify\nexplosion mechanisms of Type-Ia SNe, by analyzing the sizes of small-scale\nturbulent substructures of different elements in their extended ejecta, i.e.,\nin Supernova Remnants (SNRs). Our three-dimensional hydrodynamical models show\nthat substructures in an SNR dominated by iron-group elements may have a\ntypical size different from substructures dominated by intermediate mass\nelements (e.g., Si, S) in the same SNR. This size difference is governed by the\nexplosion mechanism. Applying this approach to Tycho's SNR, we find that its\nobserved structure is most consistent with the explosion of a sub-Chandrasekhar\nmass WD via the double-detonation mechanism. Extending this method to other\nwell-characterized SNRs can let us connect the inferred explosion mechanism to\nthe associated historical SNe, which often have spectra reconstructed through\nlight echo observations."}
