Compared to their MHz\ncounterparts, bolometers operating in this frequency range are less common\nbecause of their large absorber size and fragility. TIME aims to fabricate a\ntotal of 1920 high frequency (HF) and low frequency (LF) detectors to fully\npopulate the focal plane. TIME has successfully developed HF (230 to 325 GHz)\nand LF (183 to 230 GHz) wafers that are physically robust and perform well at\ncryogenic temperatures (300 mK). Recent laboratory tests have shown high\noptical efficiencies for the LF wafers (30 to 40%), but low device yield for\nthe HFs. To address this, new HF modules have been designed with improved\ncabling and a reduced backshort distance, and are expected to perform similarly\nto LFs in a similar lab setting. We report on the development of these\ndetectors as well as recent laboratory and on sky tests conducted at the\nArizona Radio Observatory's (ARO) 12 meter prototype antenna at Kitt Peak\nNational Observatory."}

Our goal is to investigate the origin of\nturbulence and the emission of molecular gas, as well as low- and\nintermediate-ionization gas, in the inner few kpc of both AGN hosts and SF\ngalaxies. We use JWST MIRI/MRS observations of a sample consisting of 54\ngalaxies at z<0.1.

AGNs exhibit broader emission lines than SFGs, with the\nlargest velocity dispersions observed in radio-strong (RS) AGNs. H2 gas is less\nturbulent compared to ionized gas, while coronal gas presents higher velocity\ndispersions. The W80 values for the ionized gas exhibits a decrease from the\nnucleus out to radii of approximately 0.5--1 kpc, followed by an outward\nincrease up to 2-3 kpc. In contrast, the H2 line widths generally display\nincreasing profiles with distance from the center. Correlations W80 and line\nratios such as H2 S(5)/[ArII] and [FeII]/[ArII] indicate that the most\nturbulent gas is associated with shocks, enhancing H2 and [FeII] emissions. We\nspeculate that these shocked gas regions are produced by AGN outflows and\njet-cloud interactions in AGN-dominated sources, while in SFGs, they may be\ncreated by stellar winds and mergers. This shock-induced gas heating may be an\nimportant mechanism of AGN (or stellar) feedback, preventing the gas from\ncooling and forming new stars."}

We find for both mass ranges that only $\\sim$ 1 percent of\nMW-like galaxies contain a PoS similar to that of the MW. Nevertheless, these\noutliers occur naturally in $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We analyze the formation,\nenvironment, and evolution of the PoS for nine systems that are most MW-like.\nWe suggest that a PoS can form from one or more of at least five different\nprocesses. A massive Magellanic~Cloud (MC)-like satellite is found in 1/3 of\nthe systems and probably plays an important role in the PoS formation. We find\na tendency for about half of the satellites to have recently arrived at $z <\n0.5$, indicating that a MW-like PoS is a recent and transient phenomenon. We\nalso find that a spin up of the angular momentum amplitude of the most massive\nsatellites is an indicator of the recent in-fall of the PoS satellites."}

According to the hierarchical merging\nscenario, such objects would be expected to merge on a timescale of a few\nhundred Myr. However, estimating the accurate merging timescales for the two\nnuclei is still a complex challenge. Aims. Using our numerical N-body code, we\ncan trace the full evolution of central black holes during all phases:\ndynamical friction of unbound black holes, binary black hole formation,\nhardening of the system due to two-body scattering, and emission of\ngravitational waves leading to the final merger. Methods. Our model has next\ncomponents: the bulge contains two dense stellar nuclei, each of which hosts a\nblack hole. The most massive black hole in the center of the galaxy has a mass\nof 1.54x10^8 Msol and the least massive black hole in the offset second\nstripped nucleus has a mass of 6.33x10^6 Msol. We followed the dynamical\nevolution of the system up to a final separation of four Schwarzschild radii.\nThe black holes were added as special relativistic particles and their equation\nof motion contains a full post-Newtonian approximation - 2.5 term. Results.\nInitially, the black holes are not gravitationally bound and, thus, the system\nspends more than 60 Myr in the phase of dynamical friction while tightening the\norbit. The two-body scattering phase takes place from 60 Myr up to 120 Myr. In\nthe last 10 Myr, the black hole's separation is seen to be rapidly shrinking\ndue to the gravitational wave emission. Starting from the physical separation\nobserved today, the total merging time in our model is 130 (10) Myr.\nConclusions.

Sky-projected continuum and polarization maps at 1 GHz\nwere computed from five 3D-RMHD simulations by integrating the synthesized\nemissivity data along the line of sight, with the integration path chosen to\nreflect the GRG evolution in the sky plane. The emissivities were derived from\nthese RMHD simulations, featuring FR-I and FR-II jets injected from different\nlocations of the large-scale environment. The jet-cocoon morphologies are\nstrongly shaped by the triaxiality of the environment, resulting in features\nlike wings and asymmetric cocoons, thereby making morphology a crucial\nindicator of GRG formation mechanisms. The decollimation of the bulk flow in\nGRG jets gives rise to intricate cocoon features, most notably filamentary\nstructures-magnetically dominated threads with lifespans of a few Myr.\nHigh-jet-power cases frequently display enhanced emission zones at mid-cocoon\ndistances (alongside warmspots around the jet-head), contradicting the\ninterpretations of the GRG as a restarting source. In such cases, examining the\nlateral intensity variation of the cocoon may reveal the source's state, with a\ngradual decrease in emission suggesting a low-active stage.

We aim to investigate the\nproperties, formation, and significance of CRDs in a sample of Milky Way mass\ngalaxies using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations. We select 260 central\nlate-type galaxies (i.e. $M_{\\rm tot} \\approx 10^{12}$, $D/T>0.5$, $N_{\\rm\nstar}>10^5$). For each galaxy, we measure the circularity of its stellar\nparticles and define the CRD by considering all particles with circularity\n$\\epsilon < -0.7$, which are located within the spatial extension of the main\ndisk. We then characterize the mass fraction, spatial extent, and star\nformation history of the CRDs. Out of the 260 galaxies, we find that 26 host\nsignificant CRDs (i.e. contributing at least 1\\% of the total stellar mass of\nthe disk). This means that CRDs are rare, consistent with the results from\nobservations. We also find that the most of the CRDs are compact (i.e. 88\\%),\nin-situ dominated (i.e.73\\%), and exhibit bursty SFHs whose peaks often\ncoincide with external perturbations. This means that external perturbations\nare able to catalyze star formation, even when a majority of the CRD's star\npopulation is in-situ. Finally, we find that a variety of formation pathways\ncan lead to CRDs, including interaction-induced in-situ bursts and smooth\naccretion of misaligned gas. Overall, our results suggest that CRDs are rare\nbut diverse in origin. In most cases, their formation is linked to the\naccretion of retrograde gas, either through mergers or environmental inflow,\nsuggesting that these structures are sensitive tracers of the galaxy's past\naccretion history."}

Stellar flybys can gravitationally\nperturb objects in the outer comet reservoir, altering their orbits and\npotentially injecting them into the inner system, thereby triggering exocomet\nshowers.\n  We aim to assess the contribution of stellar flybys to the observed exocomet\nactivity by reconstructing the stellar encounter history of beta Pictoris in\nthe past and future.\n  We used Gaia DR3 data, supplemented with radial velocities from complementary\nspectroscopic surveys, to compile a catalogue of stars currently within 80 pc\nof beta Pictoris. Their orbits were integrated backward and forward in time in\nan axisymmetric Galactic potential (Gala package) to identify encounters within\n2 pc of the system.\n  We identified 99 416 stars within 80 pc of beta Pictoris at present with\nresolved kinematics. Among these, 49 stars (including the eight components of\nfive binaries) encounter beta Pictoris within 2 pc between -1.5 Myr and +2 Myr.\nFor four of the binaries, the centre-of-mass trajectories also pass within 2\npc. We estimate the sample to be more than 60 % complete within 0.5 Myr of the\npresent.\n  Despite beta Pictoris being the eponym of its famous moving group, none of\nthe identified encounters involved its moving group members; all are unrelated\nfield stars. We find no encounter capable of shaping observed disc structures,\nalthough stellar flybys may contribute to the long-term evolution of a\npotential Oort Cloud. Our catalogue constitutes the most complete\nreconstruction of the beta Pictoris encounter history to date and provides a\nrobust foundation for future dynamical simulations."}

Benchmarks show that microJAX matches\nthe accuracy of established packages and attains up to a factor of $\\sim$5-6\nspeed-up in the small-source, limb-darkened regime on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. Since\nthe model is fully differentiable, it integrates seamlessly with probabilistic\nprogramming frameworks, enabling scalable Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and\nvariational inference workflows. Although the present work focuses on standard\nmicrolensing magnification models, the modular architecture is designed to\nsupport upcoming implementations of microlensing higher-order effects, while\nremaining compatible with external likelihood frameworks that incorporate\nadvanced noise models. microJAX thus provides a robust foundation for precise\nand large-scale surveys anticipated in the coming decade, including the Nancy\nGrace Roman Space Telescope, where scalable, physically self-consistent\ninference will be essential for maximizing scientific return."}

These anomalies are often attributed to\ndark matter subhalos, but the baryonic components of the lens can also play a\nsignificant role. This study investigates the impact of galactic bars, a common\nfeature in spiral galaxies, on flux ratio anomalies. We conduct a systematic\nanalysis using a sample of 21 barred galaxies from the high-resolution Auriga\ncosmological simulations. First, we model the projected mass distribution of\nthese galaxies with the Multi-Gaussian Expansion formalism. This method yields\nsmooth lens potentials that preserve the primary bar structure while mitigating\nnumerical noise. We then perform strong lensing simulations and quantify the\nflux ratio anomalies by measuring their deviation from the theoretical\ncusp-caustic relation. To characterize the structural properties of the bars,\nwe use a Fourier decomposition of the surface mass density in the bar region.\nOur primary finding is a strong, statistically significant correlation between\nthe magnitude of the flux ratio anomaly and the strength of higher-order even\nFourier modes. Specifically, the strengths of the boxy/peanut and hexapole\ncomponents show an exceptionally tight correlation with the flux anomaly, with\nSpearman correlation coefficients of r=0.85 and 0.89, and p-values on the order\nof 1e-6 and 1e-8, respectively. This demonstrates that flux ratio anomalies are\nhighly sensitive to the complex, non-axisymmetric features of galactic bars. We\nconclude that the flux ratio anomaly can be a powerful indicator of a galactic\nbar's complex morphology. Failing to account for a bar's complex morphology can\nlead to a misinterpretation of the lensing signature, potentially causing an\noverestimation of the dark matter subhalo population."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "We report here on observations of a tidal disruption event, XMMSL2\nJ1404-2511, discovered in an XMM-Newton slew, in a quiescent galaxy at z=0.043.\nX-ray monitoring covered the epoch when the accretion disc transitioned from a\nthermal state, with kT~80 eV, to a harder state dominated by a warm,\noptically-thick corona. The bulk of the coronal formation took place within 7\ndays and was coincident with a temporary drop in the emitted radiation by a\nfactor 4. After a plateau phase of ~100 days, the X-ray flux of XMMSL2\nJ1404-2511 decayed by a factor 500 within 230 days. We estimate the black hole\nmass in the galaxy to be $M_{BH}=4\\pm{2}\\times10^{6}$ solar masses and the peak\nX-ray luminosity $L_{X}\\sim6\\times10^{43}$ ergs/s. The optical/UV light curve\nis flat over the timescale of the observations with $L_{opt}\\sim\n2\\times10^{41}$ ergs/s. We find that TDEs with coronae are more often found in\nan X-ray sample than in an optically-selected sample. Late-time monitoring of\nthe optical sample is needed to test whether this is an intrinsic property of\nTDEs or is due to a selection effect. From the fast decay of the X-ray emission\nwe consider that the event was likely due to the partial stripping of an\nevolved star rather than a full stellar disruption, an idea supported by the\ndetection of two further re-brightening episodes, two and four years after the\nfirst event, in the SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey."}

Based on the data of 5,859\ntargets observed in M31 by Gu et al (\\citeyear{2024ApJS..273....9G}), we\nselected 30 contact binaries by visual inspection for further study. Using the\nPHOEBE software and employing Bayesian optimization and Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo sampling, we determined the physical parameters of these 30 systems. The\nresults show that 10 systems exhibit the O'Connell effect, which is well\nexplained by introducing a dark spot on the primary star. 11 systems have mass\nratios below 0.15, classifying them as extremely low mass ratio contact\nbinaries, making them promising candidates for binary mergers. Six systems have\nprimary star temperatures exceeding 10,000 K, classifying them as early-type\ncontact binaries. The absolute physical parameters reveal that two contact\nbinary systems contain massive stellar components, which may eventually evolve\ninto compact binary star systems. To compare the effects of different galactic\nenvironments on the evolution of contact binaries, we constructed evolutionary\ndiagrams for these 30 targets and for contact binaries in the Milky Way. The\nresults show that, at the same mass, our targets have larger radii, higher\nluminosities, and lower orbital angular momenta than contact binaries in the\nMilky Way, indicating that they are at more advanced evolutionary stages. This\nmay be attributed to the higher metallicity in M31 compared to the Milky Way."}

In contrast to relativistic CRs, transport of\nlower-energy particles in the envelopes is generally heavily affected by\nionization losses; furthermore, both CR protons and electrons contribute to\nwave excitation.

In this work, we present results of XMM-Newton mosaic\nobservations of a third, southwestern, cold front at a radius of $r \\approx\n250$ kpc, originally discovered with Suzaku. All three cold fronts are likely\nto be parts of an enormous swirling pattern, rooted in the core. The comparison\nwith a numerical simulation of a binary cluster merger indicates that these\ncold fronts were produced in the same single event $-$ likely the infall of M49\nfrom the northwest of Virgo and it is now re-entering the cluster from the\nsouth. This outermost cold front has probably survived for $2-3$ Gyr since the\ndisturbance. We identified single sharp edges in the surface brightness\nprofiles of the southern and southwestern sections of the cold front, whereas\nthe western section is better characterized with double edges. This implies\nthat magnetic fields have preserved the leading edge of the cold front, while\nits western side is beginning to split into two cold fronts likely due to\nKelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. The slopes of the 2D power spectrum of the\nX-ray surface brightness fluctuations, derived for the brighter side of the\ncold front, are consistent with the expectation from Kolmogorov turbulence. Our\nfindings highlight the role of cold fronts in shaping the thermal dynamics of\nthe intracluster medium beyond the cluster core, which has important\nimplications for cluster cosmology. Next-generation X-ray observatories, such\nas the proposed AXIS mission, will be ideal for identifying and characterizing\nancient cold fronts."}
