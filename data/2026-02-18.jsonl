Because these features are extremely faint, alternative tracers such as globular clusters (GCs) provide a powerful tool to study cluster assembly. We use deep VLT/FORS $V$- and $I$-band imaging to investigate the GC population in the nearby Hydra I galaxy cluster ($\\sim 45.7$ Mpc). GC candidates were selected from the $VI$ colour-magnitude diagram and divided into blue and red subpopulations. We find a clear spatial dichotomy: red GCs are concentrated around the massive central galaxies NGC 3311 and NGC 3309, while blue GCs are more extended and offset from the centre, coinciding with a secondary peak of X-ray-emitting gas. In the central regions, GC spatial distributions further depend on stellar population properties: young metal-rich GCs are more extended and may be linked to ram-pressure stripping, whereas old metal-poor GCs are more centrally concentrated, possibly originating from disrupted dwarf galaxies. Comparing the GC number density profiles to the surface brightness profile of NGC 3311, we find that the red GCs closely follow the galaxy light, while the blue population significantly deviates from it and traces the global gravitational potential of the cluster. This is also reflected in the specific frequency of blue GCs, which is approximately $\\sim 5\\times$ higher in the ICL-dominated outskirts than in the inner regions dominated by red GCs. Finally, we present a novel method to constrain the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function of the cluster using GC specific frequencies and colour distributions, yielding a past faint-end slope of $α=-1.81^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$ compared to $α=-1.41^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ today, consistent with high-redshift observations and cosmological simulations."}

Previous observations of barium stars have found evidence that they form through mass transfer from a companion asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star or through radiative levitation. The chemical abundance and kinematic information of barium stars may help constrain AGB stellar nucleosynthesis, binary star evolution, and internal evolutionary processes that affect surface abundances. Using ~450,000 stars from the GALactic Archaeology with Hermes (GALAH) survey, we identify nearly 3000 new barium-rich stars and separate them into hot (Teff > 6000 K) and cool (Teff < 6000 K) populations. Cross-matching with Gaia DR3, we find that 47.7% of our barium stars within 1 kpc have elevated re-normalized unit weight error (RUWE >= 1.4), compared to 16.3% of a comparable sample of the GALAH field, suggesting multiplicity plays an important role in the formation of both populations of barium stars. A subset of hot barium stars exhibit low RUWE (RUWE < 1.2) and [alpha/Fe] < -0.2, supporting radiative levitation as an origin as well. We determine Galactic memberships using both kinematics and chemistry and find that barium stars exist in the thin disk, thick disk, and halo though they are slightly more prevalent at lower metallicities. Overall, we show evidence for barium stars produced by mass transfer and for those produced by radiative levitation, with both formation mechanisms occurring ubiquitously across the Galaxy."}

Most theoretical work is based on analytic calculations or idealised simulations, which has yielded several theories of spiral structure. The radial profile of the spiral arm rotation speed - the pattern speed - is a key observable prediction of these theories. However, observations that infer spiral pattern speeds reveal a mixed picture with no clear consensus. Here, we expand on theoretical efforts by examining the pattern speed profiles in the Auriga Superstars set of high-resolution cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulatons of Milky Way-mass spiral disc galaxies. These simulations combine galaxy formation in a cosmological environment with the high dynamical fidelity afforded by an $\\sim 800$ $\\rm M_{\\odot}$ star particle resolution, giving $\\sim 100$ million star particles in the disc. We show that several different spiral arm theories are realised among our simulations, including large-scale kinematic density waves, manifold spirals, dynamic (co-rotating) spirals, and overlapping modes. In particular, we demonstrate that a strong tidal interaction leads to clear kinematic density waves, and that manifold spirals are present in a strongly-barred galaxy. Interestingly, we find that the same galaxy may show qualitative evolution of their spiral pattern speed profiles, indicating that the nature of spiral arms can evolve on potentially sub-Gigayear timescales. Our results demonstrate that in the absence of a strong external encounter or a strong bar, galactic spiral structure is highly transitional and complex with no clear long-lived underlying wave."}

Our results provide strong evidence for significant differences ($\\sim$3$σ$) between the triggering mechanisms of the different sub-types of powerful radio AGN. The high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs) show a high rate of morphological disturbance (62$^{+6}_{-7}$ per cent) -- an excess of $\\sim$4$σ$ compared with the control sample -- consistent with them being predominantly triggered in galaxy mergers and interactions. In contrast, the low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) show a much lower rate of morphological disturbance (36$^{+7}_{-6}$ per cent), consistent with the control sample, and suggesting a different dominant triggering mechanism, such as the accretion of gas from the hot X-ray haloes of the host galaxies or galaxy clusters. We also demonstrate that, when considering the radio morphology, the FRII HERG sources preferentially reside in disturbed morphologies, a difference of $\\sim$3$σ$ to the FRII LERG objects. This suggests that the FRII LERG sources do not solely represent a `switched-off' phase in the HERG lifecycle of the same parent galaxy population as the FRII HERGs."}

We have deployed real-time ingestion of newly acquired data and a dedicated interface for observers to manage these data. Our ADASS 2024 poster identified the new technologies chosen: Plotly-Dash, a low-code framework that exploits event-driven callbacks to simplify the handling of user interactions; R-tree spatial indexing to speed up spatial searches by x20; a VO-compliant TAP middleware, already in use at the NASA Exoplanet Archive and NEID archive; and mViewer, a visualization engine in the Montage Image Mosaic toolkit that is optimized for astronomy images.\n  These technologies will underpin new services that can be hosted on web pages or in Jupyter notebooks, and when completed, will replace the current query infrastructure. We have completed two new services now in beta release. The first is the Data Discovery Service, a web-based dashboard that returns spatial and temporal queries of the entire archive in seconds. It supports filtering observations by keywords, previewing results in an interactive data grid, and visualizing images, and it offers data downloads. The second is a Jupyter notebook that performs interactive visualization of Keck observations of protostars in the Rho Oph Dark Cloud and uses data from CDS and IRSA, as well as KOA."}

If the atmosphere is near hydrostatic equilibrium and is stable to convection, then it can remain nearly homogeneous, as long as it is not too dense. But if its density is great enough, it becomes prone to producing a rain of cold clouds that fall toward the galaxy's center and accrete onto its central black hole. Here we explain how relatively weak magnetic fields enhance a galactic atmosphere's tendency to produce cold clouds and how the cold gas becomes organized into vertically elongated, highly magnetized filaments descending at sub-Keplerian speeds. It is intended to complement recent numerical simulations of the process and to serve as a guide to interpreting both simulations and observations of the filamentary gas in hot galactic atmospheres."}

Such triggers are essential for coordinating rapid electromagnetic follow-up. In this work, we introduce GW-FALCON, a novel feature-driven DL framework for early-time detection between GW signal+noise and noise-only data in next-generation detectors. Instead of feeding raw time series to CNN or more complex neural network architectures, we first extract a large set of statistical, temporal, and spectral quantities from short observational time windows using the TSFEL library. The resulting fixed-length feature vectors are then used as input to feed-forward ANNs suitable for low-latency operation. We demonstrate the method using simulated BNS and NSBH inspiral waveforms injected into colored Gaussian noise generated from the ET and CE design PSDs. We train separate ANNs on feature sets extracted from partial-inspiral windows characterized by different maximum instantaneous frequencies, enabling early-warning triggers from tens to hundreds of seconds before merger. Across all detector configurations and datasets, the resulting classifiers achieve high accuracy and detection efficiency, with ET-like networks typically reaching test accuracies of order 90% and CE-like ones exceeding 97% at low false-alarm probability. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first comprehensive feature-based DL detection framework for Next-generation GW observatories, connecting feature extraction from strain time series data to robust signal-noise classification within a setup that can be extended to real data and to more advanced neural network architectures."}

With the aim to generate synthetic empirical data for fine-tuning LSS classification algorithms, as well as to train machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) models for the same purpose, this work presents a purely geometrical simulation based on statistical spatial properties found in LSS surveys, using the spectroscopic main galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogue up to a redshift of z~0.1 as a specific use case. A parallelism between the LSS and the Voronoi tessellation was utilised, in which the nodes, links, surfaces, and cells of the diagram correspond to clusters, filaments, walls, and voids, respectively. The simulation used random positions within voids as seeds for tessellating the 3D space. The resulting structures were randomly populated with galaxies that adhere to the statistical properties of their observational respective structures. As the galaxies were generated, they were tagged with their corresponding structure. In each simulation, six LSS mock catalogues were generated, following the statistical behaviour observed in the SDSS catalogue, depending on the structure they belong to. The Malmquist bias and the Fingers of God effect were simulated as well. We present a novel geometrical LSS simulator, where generated galaxies mimic the statistical properties of their observational belonging structure. The simulator was tuned to mimic the SDSS catalogue, although any other catalogue can be considered. With the generated catalogue, it is possible to adjust the LSS classification algorithms, train and test ML/DL models, and benchmark several LSS classification methods using this pre-labelled data to contrast their results and performance."}

We compare the properties (morphologies, the presence of interactions, rest-frame colours and environment) of our AGN to galaxies in a control sample, which are drawn from the non-variable population and matched in redshift and stellar mass to their AGN counterparts. The fraction of AGN with early-type morphology ($\\sim$55 per cent) and the fraction that is interacting ($\\sim$23 per cent) are similar to what is observed in the controls, suggesting that these AGN are not primarily triggered by interactions. Similarly, the AGN and controls do not show strong differences in their rest-frame $(u-z)$ colours or local environment, suggesting that neither the recent star formation histories nor the surroundings of the AGN are strongly atypical of the general galaxy population. This study provides a glimpse into forthcoming AGN science using the LSST. With vastly improved statistics, LSST will offer unprecedented insights into AGN demographics, host-galaxy evolution and the processes that fuel supermassive black holes, potentially reshaping our understanding of their place in the Universe."}

To this end, we focus on the class of $f(R,T)$ models defined by $f(R,T)=R+F(T)$, which provide a simple yet theoretically consistent realization of nonminimal matter-gravity interactions and can be reformulated as general relativity minimally coupled to a modified matter Lagrangian. Using nonstandard global monopole solutions as a toy model for realistic particles, we show that the spatial average of $F$ typically differs significantly from $F$ evaluated at the spatially averaged trace of $T$, implying that homogeneous cosmological models generally fail to capture the correct large-scale dynamics of the Universe. We further show that dust in these theories generally exhibits a non-vanishing proper pressure. Our results underscore the necessity of properly accounting for spatial averaging when modeling cosmology in theories with nonminimal matter-gravity couplings."}

We present a theoretical framework based on the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) semi-analytic model. We extracted portions of simulated volumes that include isolated galaxies, pairs, group, and filament members at z ~ 0, specifically avoiding massive clusters. Galaxies were classified using both intrinsic (halo-based) and observational (2D projected) parameterizations, reconstructing their environmental histories from z = 2 and identifying mergers, tidal interactions, ram pressure stripping (RPS), and starvation. 2D information decreases isolated and group fractions while doubles pairs. More than half of galaxies remain unaffected by the investigated processes since z = 2. Among affected galaxies, mergers dominate at high stellar masses (40-60% at log(M*/Msun) > 10.5). Tidal interactions are less frequent, and their incidence increases with stellar mass. RPS dominates in groups and filaments at intermediate masses (~50%), while starvation ranges from 20 to 30%. The incidence of the different mechanisms depends strongly on both mass and environment, though their imprints on global properties are often subtle. Distinct evolutionary pathways emerge: log(M*/Msun) < 9.5, galaxies in groups and filaments have a faster mass growth than galaxies in the other environments, especially those undergoing starvation, mergers and, to less extent, RPS. Differences are reduced moving to higher masses, where no clear dependence on physical mechanism emerge, even though at these masses a clear star formation suppression is evident in mergers and starved galaxies.

We further question whether the aggressively filtered subset used in Watters et al. (2026) demonstrates a meaningful improvement in sample purity, given the twenty-fold reduction in sample size. Our simple, visual check does not suggest that it does. The subset further lacks complete temporal information and is seriously statistically underpowered for testing the reported Earth-shadow deficit. We emphasise that the horizontal separation metric used for plate assignment and time reconstruction as in Watters et al. (2026) depends on the inclusion of the cos(Dec) factor to ensure geometric consistency. Any omission would alter plate assignment and inferred observation times. Moreover, the analyses presented in Watters et al. (2026) do not include uncertainty estimates or error propagation, limiting the interpretability of the claimed null results. We conclude that the principal findings reported in Villarroel et al. (2025) and Bruehl & Villarroel (2025) are not invalidated by the analyses presented in Watters et al. (2026)."}

Here we use GPS carrier phase archival data to perform a retrospective search for exotic low-mass fields (ELFs) that might be emitted by the binary neutron-star merger GW170817, complementing gravitational wave and electromagnetic modalitiesnin multi-messenger astronomy. Such ultra-relativistic fields would imprint a dispersive, anti-chirp signature in clock-frequency time series, delayed with respect to the LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave detection. We construct network-median pseudo-frequency data from eighteen Rb satellite clocks referenced to a terrestrial hydrogen maser and conduct a template-bank search spanning ELF pulse duration, arrival delay, and characteristic frequency. No statistically significant signal is observed after accounting for noise statistics and template-bank trials. We derive 95\\% confidence-level lower bounds on the interaction energy scale $Λ_α$ of quadratic couplings driving variations in electromagnetic fine-structure constant.

Exploiting Hodge dualities, the theory is formulated in terms of two scalar functions that are associated with the conjugate momentum, and the three-form dual vector in an isotropic background. The resulting Lagrangian yields a stable scaling attractor where the three-form energy density tracks the dominant background fluid. A dynamical mechanism is also identified that naturally drives the system out of this regime toward a late-time accelerated phase distinguishable from a cosmological constant. This constitutes the first realization of scaling behavior within a three-form dark energy framework."}

The star-forming gas (SFG) in HII regions and young stars (YSs) trace the recent evolutionary history of the galaxy. We aim to assess the extent to which the joint analysis of metallicity gradient alignment in YSs and SFG can constrain the recent evolutionary history of galaxies. Using the high-resolution run of the EAGLE project, we derived radial, azimuthally averaged oxygen abundance profiles for YSs (age < 2 Gyr) and SFG and measured their gradients as the slopes of linear fits to these profiles. We classified galaxies into four groups based on the signs (N for negative and P for positive) of the slopes: NN, NP, PP, and PN (the first letter is for YSs and the second for SFG). We found that galaxies with NN, NP, PP, and PN combinations of metallicity profiles reflect different evolutionary paths over the past ~ 2 Gyr. NN galaxies exhibit sustained inside-out growth accompanied by high star formation efficiency, whereas NP and PP systems show evidence of recent or ongoing feedback-driven disruption, with PP galaxies likely being predominantly shaped by supernova feedback. PN galaxies, by contrast, show evidence of past violent events followed by gradient recovery, highlighting the interplay between inflows, feedback, and gas cooling in shaping metallicity distributions. The degree of alignment between the stellar and gas metallicity gradients provides a way to time the occurrence of significant events in the evolutionary history of galaxies, which contribute through a combination of gas inflows, star formation triggering, and metal mixing. They could also serve as probes of sub-grid physics when observations provide suitable comparison datasets. [Abridged]"}

Unfortunately, slow altitude drifts of the sodium layer compromise focus measurements, generating the so-called slow focus error, and, consequently, a natural guide star (NGS) is needed to compensate for that error. Our goal is to develop and operationalize a focal plane wavefront sensing (FPWFS) technique for slow focus tracking for the Keck I telescope, which can significantly increase sky coverage and allow slow focus tracking at higher frequencies, reducing the lag error. We develop, characterize, and compare three different FPWFS algorithms, namely Gerchberg-Saxton (GS), linearized focal plane technique (LiFT), and Gaussian fit (Gf). These algorithms were studied for the specific purpose of slow focus sensing in the NIR (H and K bands) using numerical simulations and data collected at Keck in 2025 (bench and on-sky). The three algorithms were studied and characterized against different criteria such as linearity, computational costs, and resistance to low signal-to-noise ratio and/or residuals. From the results obtained, the main candidate for an on-sky deployment was GS. On-sky tests showed promising results, with GS successfully compensating for purposely introduced focus errors, even under the presence of high turbulence conditions. This work can also be extrapolated to other existing 8-10 m class telescopes, or even future 30-40 m class telescopes, where the use of FPWFS can significantly improve sky coverage and reduce the lag error."}

In this study, we investigate how deviations from the standard nearly-scale-free primordial power spectrum impact observables for the fully compact, orientable Euclidean topologies ($E_1$--$E_6$). We examine how such deviations modify the detectability of the underlying topology, depending on whether they are an intrinsic consequence of non-trivial topology or independent of it. We compute CMB temperature correlation matrices across a range of topologies, fundamental domain sizes, and observer locations for both standard and modified primordial power spectra. The impact of these modifications on the detectability of topology is quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, providing an estimate of the distinguishability of non-trivial and simply-connected topologies based solely on CMB temperature observations. In addition, we employ the CatBoost machine learning algorithm to classify harmonic-space realizations of CMB temperature maps and thereby assess the observational prospects for topology detection. Signatures of non-trivial topology are encoded in the off-diagonal structure of the CMB temperature correlation matrices and are most prominent on the largest angular scales. Deviations from the simple power-law primordial spectrum at these scales can substantially alter the detectability of topology, either enhancing its characteristic CMB imprints or suppressing them below observational sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in the primordial power spectrum must be carefully accounted for in robust searches for cosmic topology using the CMB."}

PIFF is widely used in leading weak-lensing surveys, including the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The PSF characterizes how a point source, such as a star, is imaged after its light traverses the atmosphere and telescope optics, effectively representing the \"blurred fingerprint'' of the entire imaging system. Accurate PSF modeling is essential for weak gravitational lensing analyses, as biases in its estimation propagate directly into cosmic shear measurements -- one of the primary cosmological probes of the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of large-scale structure for dark energy studies. To address the limitations of PIFF, which constructs PSF models independently for each CCD and therefore loses spatial coherence across the focal plane, we introduce a deep-learning-based framework for PSF reconstruction. In this approach, an autoencoder is trained on stellar images obtained with the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) of the Subaru Telescope and combined with a Gaussian process to interpolate the PSF across the telescope's full field of view. This hybrid model captures systematic variations across the focal plane and achieves a reconstruction error of $3.4 \\times 10^{-6}$ compared to PIFF's $3.7 \\times 10^{-6}$, laying the foundation for integration into the LSST Science Pipelines."}

The quasar (QSO) number densities are a powerful probe for understanding the effects of intervening material. Absorption lines in QSO spectra reveal the presence of interstellar and intergalactic gas, which can change observed fluxes through dust extinction and plasma lensing. By combining observations from radio (VLASS), infrared (WISE), and optical bands (DESI), we assembled a sample of QSOs: ~4000 sources with MgII absorbers, and ~12, 000 non-absorbers. In the radio band, the MgII sample shows a moderate excess at the bright end of the flux distribution, which is broadly consistent with plasma lensing predications. In the optical, the MgII sample turns over at higher g-band fluxes and exhibits a steeper decline at the faint end than the non-MgII sample. Control samples were constructed by matching in redshift, infrared (W1), and optical (g) luminosities. In these comparisons, the radio excess becomes less prominent, suggesting that the apparent magnification may not be robust evidence for plasma lensing. Nevertheless, a weak contribution cannot be ruled out, especially given residual excess observed at the bright end relative to the non-MgII sample. Dust extinction along the line-of-sight remains a plausible alternative. Regardless of the dominant mechanism, the multi-wavelength differences offer a valuable probe of the physical state of the intervening medium."}

When embedded within extended matter distributions such as prolate, shell-like halos, they give rise to complex gravitational fields that often drive nearby particles into chaotic orbits. The inherently nonlinear nature of such motion, shaped by general relativity, makes direct analysis highly challenging. To overcome this, pseudo-Newtonian potentials are used to approximate relativistic effects within a Newtonian framework. In this study, we model the central SMBH using the Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov (1996) potential to mimic the rotational effects of a Kerr-like black hole. The surrounding prolate halo is treated as an axisymmetric, shell-like mass distribution, represented through a multipole expansion including dipole and quadrupole components. Poincare sections and the Maximum Lyapunov Exponent (MLE) reveal how the SMBH-halo system drives both order and chaos, with the SMBH spin modulating the dynamics by enhancing or suppressing chaos depending on its direction and magnitude."}

The method exploits analytic structure in the relevant Wigner-3j symbol configurations appearing in temperature and polarization coupling matrices, expressing all required quantities in terms of a small set of recurrence-generated values which are precomputed and stored in lookup tables. This approach reduces the computational cost of constructing the full coupling matrices whilst maintaining numerical accuracy.\n  We demonstrate the performance of the threej_cosmo implementation using realistic survey masks from current CMB experiments. Relative to standard recursion-based approaches used in existing pseudo-C_l pipelines, the method achieves speedups of 6-25x in practical coupling-matrix constructions, with the largest gains occurring at high multipoles. The algorithm admits efficient parallelisation on both CPUs and GPUs, the latter providing additional acceleration, up to a further order of 50 on modern hardware, without altering the underlying formalism.\n  Beyond full matrix construction, the approach is naturally suited to applications in which only a restricted set of l3 modes is required for each (l1,l2) pair, such as in the computation of band-limited coupling matrices and analytic covariance terms. These features make threej_cosmo a practical backend for pseudo-C_l estimation and related calculations in next-generation CMB analysis pipelines."}

To be submitted to JCAP. Comments are welcome!", "summary": "21cm radiation from neutral hydrogen serves as a direct probe of the Epoch of Reionization. However, both its detection and physical interpretation are severely hindered by contamination from astrophysical foreground emission and instrumental noise that are several orders of magnitude brighter than the signal of interest. A promising way to tackle these challenges is to cross-correlate the 21cm signal with other independent tracers of large-scale structure, most notably high-redshift galaxies. Besides validating putative 21cm detections, such joint analyses are expected to provide independent insights into the properties of ionizing sources and the evolving morphology of ionized regions during reionization. The 21cm signal, however, is intrinsically highly non-Gaussian, limiting the effectiveness of conventional two-point cross-correlation statistics, which capture information only up to the second order. In this work, we therefore investigate the utility of k-nearest-neighbour cumulative distribution functions (kNN CDF), which encode information from the joint clustering at all orders, as an alternative framework for probing 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations. Using self-consistently simulated mock 21cm fields and a catalog of line-emitting galaxies at z = 7, we conducted a proof-of-concept study comparing the kNN CDF formalism and the two-point cross-correlation approach. We find that the kNN CDF statistics outperform the two-point statistics in detecting 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations, even in the presence of instrumental noise and aggressive foreground filtering. Moreover, at a fixed global ionized fraction, it is even able to differentiate between reionization models that remain indistinguishable using two-point statistics. These results demonstrate the power and unexplored potential of exploiting higher-order statistics for extracting maximal information from 21cm-galaxy synergies."}

After a month-long recovery effort, a 13.8 kg iron meteorite was discovered near Ådalen, representing the first instrumentally recorded and recovered fall of its type and the first iron meteorite with a derivable heliocentric orbit; the event also exhibited the lowest terminal height measured for a well-documented fireball. We combine optical, infrasound, and seismic data to reconstruct the luminous trajectory and employ a Monte Carlo model to simulate the dark flight phase and predicted strewn field, while also investigating the plausibility of a ricochet prior to final deposition.

It was equipped with the Mars Dust Counter (MDC) which was an impact ionisation dust detector. MDC detected 96 dust particle impacts when the spacecraft was in Earth orbit and later in interplanetary space, before its operation ended in April 2002 due to a technical failure on board. We compare the Nozomi dust measurements with the dust measurements obtained with the dust detector on board the Ulysses spacecraft. Impact speeds and masses of dust particles measured by Nozomi MDC are overall consistent with the measurements obtained by Ulysses in the same region of interplanetary space. Based on the impact speeds measured while Nozomi was in Earth orbit, MDC detected neither dust particles of natural origin that were bound to the Earth nor space debris. The dust impact rate measured in interplanetary space varied by approximately a factor of 2, consistent with theoretical predictions by the Interplanetary Meteoroid Engineering Model. The particle impact direction was concentrated towards the ecliptic plane, in agreement with an interplanetary origin of the majority of the measured dust particles. No impacts of cometary trail particles could positively be identified during known cometary trail crossings of Nozomi. The Nozomi dust data may become a valuable reference for the dust measurements to be obtained in the same region of interplanetary space with future space missions like, for example, MMX and DESTINY$^+$."}

We also construct models which generate such NMOs as solutions within the two-scalar theory and scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity inspired by string theory. The orbits of the photon and massive particles are investigated in the background, where there is a negative mass object which realises a kind of effective anti-gravity. It is explicitly found that the bound system consisting of a positive mass object and a negative mass object can be formed in spite that a positive mass object suffers the repulsive force from the NMO. The possibility that such exotic objects might be observed is discussed. A simple conjecture about their possible masses is made, too. As an even more exotic object, we consider a non-trivial object with vanishing mass and investigate its properties."}

Our dataset includes 14,747 sources with multi-band photometry from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE, combined with recent distance and extinction estimates. For a subsample of 2,494 Mira variables, we model multi-band light curves to derive accurate mean magnitudes.\n  Stellar and circumstellar parameters are obtained by fitting observations with a large grid of synthetic spectra computed with the DUSTY radiative transfer code using COMARCS atmospheres. We derive effective temperature, optical depth, and gas mass-loss rate for each source. The distributions peak around Teff = 3150 K, with mass-loss rates spanning 1e-11 to 1e-4 Msun/yr and inner dust temperatures near 1000 K. We find a correlation between variability amplitude and mass-loss rate.\n  This framework provides a statistically robust view of carbon stars across environments with different metallicities.

Because these features are extremely faint, alternative tracers such as globular clusters (GCs) provide a powerful tool to study cluster assembly. We use deep VLT/FORS $V$- and $I$-band imaging to investigate the GC population in the nearby Hydra I galaxy cluster ($\\sim 45.7$ Mpc). GC candidates were selected from the $VI$ colour-magnitude diagram and divided into blue and red subpopulations. We find a clear spatial dichotomy: red GCs are concentrated around the massive central galaxies NGC 3311 and NGC 3309, while blue GCs are more extended and offset from the centre, coinciding with a secondary peak of X-ray-emitting gas. In the central regions, GC spatial distributions further depend on stellar population properties: young metal-rich GCs are more extended and may be linked to ram-pressure stripping, whereas old metal-poor GCs are more centrally concentrated, possibly originating from disrupted dwarf galaxies. Comparing the GC number density profiles to the surface brightness profile of NGC 3311, we find that the red GCs closely follow the galaxy light, while the blue population significantly deviates from it and traces the global gravitational potential of the cluster. This is also reflected in the specific frequency of blue GCs, which is approximately $\\sim 5\\times$ higher in the ICL-dominated outskirts than in the inner regions dominated by red GCs. Finally, we present a novel method to constrain the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function of the cluster using GC specific frequencies and colour distributions, yielding a past faint-end slope of $α=-1.81^{+0.16}_{-0.16}$ compared to $α=-1.41^{+0.08}_{-0.05}$ today, consistent with high-redshift observations and cosmological simulations."}

Moreover, also the starburst ring of these sources is bright in the radio and hence, a potential source of $γ$-rays and neutrinos.\n  We aim to explain the non-thermal features of these two sources with our homogeneous steady-state Seyfert-starburst composite model, which we refined in this work. Hereby, we account for stochastic diffuse acceleration and energy losses within the corona and $γγ$-pair attenuation of the escaping $γ$-rays. Since the non-thermal features of Seyfert sources contribute only marginally to the electromagnetic spectrum, only few data points can be assigned to the starburst ring or the AGN corona. Hence, prior information on the physical parameters is incorporated within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to avoid overfitting.\n  Based on this Bayesian parameter study we show, that the non-thermal features of NGC 1068 can be explained well. Still a more detailed treatment of the spatial inhomogeneities in the central region of the AGN could further improve the fit results. This manifests itself even more clearly in the case of NGC 7469, where the mm-bump needs to emerge from a coronal size $R_{\\rm c}>100\\,\\mathcal{R}_{\\rm s}$, whereas (TeV-PeV)-neutrino emission requires $R_{\\rm c}< 10\\,\\mathcal{R}_{\\rm s}$. Similar to what has previously been shown in other wavebands, our analysis highlights that the spatial extension of the so-called AGN corona depends the considered energy of the messenger. Hence, it seems that there is not a unique edge of the corona and a substantial progress in the understanding of these phenomena is expected if future analysis account for these spatial inhomogeneities."}

Most theoretical work is based on analytic calculations or idealised simulations, which has yielded several theories of spiral structure. The radial profile of the spiral arm rotation speed - the pattern speed - is a key observable prediction of these theories. However, observations that infer spiral pattern speeds reveal a mixed picture with no clear consensus. Here, we expand on theoretical efforts by examining the pattern speed profiles in the Auriga Superstars set of high-resolution cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulatons of Milky Way-mass spiral disc galaxies. These simulations combine galaxy formation in a cosmological environment with the high dynamical fidelity afforded by an $\\sim 800$ $\\rm M_{\\odot}$ star particle resolution, giving $\\sim 100$ million star particles in the disc. We show that several different spiral arm theories are realised among our simulations, including large-scale kinematic density waves, manifold spirals, dynamic (co-rotating) spirals, and overlapping modes. In particular, we demonstrate that a strong tidal interaction leads to clear kinematic density waves, and that manifold spirals are present in a strongly-barred galaxy. Interestingly, we find that the same galaxy may show qualitative evolution of their spiral pattern speed profiles, indicating that the nature of spiral arms can evolve on potentially sub-Gigayear timescales. Our results demonstrate that in the absence of a strong external encounter or a strong bar, galactic spiral structure is highly transitional and complex with no clear long-lived underlying wave."}

Over the past decade, growing observational evidence has suggested a possible continuity between slow- (IIP) and fast-declining (IIL) SNe. We investigate the continuity of the SNe IIP/L subclasses through a data-driven statistical analysis of spectral time series, aiming to determine whether significant correlations exist between overall spectral shapes and light-curve decline rates. We introduce a novel standardization method for SN II spectra. After empirically flattening the spectra via continuum normalization, we interpolate the resulting \"feature spectra\" onto a fixed grid of epochs using Gaussian Process regression. The interpolated spectra are then analyzed using Principal Component Analysis to explore correlations. We find that SNe IIP and IIL form a continuum spectroscopically, though some clustering remains. The spectral diversity is characterized mainly by two components: one continuous group with well-defined P-Cygni profiles and another with \"less-regular\" features likely driven by enhanced circumstellar material (CSM) interaction. Our results reveal that the spectral diversity of SNe IIP/L diminishes over time. We confirm observational correlations: steeper light-curve declines correspond to weaker spectral features, indicating that SNe IIL tend to show weaker emission and, in some cases, a lack of distinct absorption lines. These trends seemingly break down by enhanced CSM interaction that affects the P-Cygni profiles. Our data-driven method reveals underlying spectral correlations and supports a continuous distribution between IIP and IIL subtypes. This method paves the way for more refined classification algorithms."}

We measured $\\sim 2\\%$ distances to the Large (LMC) and Small Magellanic Clouds (SMC), $18.447^{+0.036}_{-0.042}$ mag ($48.9 \\pm 0.9$ kpc) and $18.898^{+0.049}_{-0.054}$ mag ($60.2 \\pm 1.4$ kpc), respectively, using a single well calibrated photometric system: RP (spectro-)photometry from GDR3. Our new TRGB distances, whose absolute scale derives from Gaia parallaxes, are fully independent of the well-known detached eclipsing binary (DEB) distances and agree with them to within the uncertainties. Combining our new TRGB and existing DEB distances, we illustrate how additional constraints may be incorporated in the Local Distance Network and obtain $H_0 = 73.52 \\pm 0.80$ km/s/Mpc. Expected improvements due to the upcoming fourth Gaia data release are discussed."}

To be submitted to JCAP. Comments are welcome!", "summary": "21cm radiation from neutral hydrogen serves as a direct probe of the Epoch of Reionization. However, both its detection and physical interpretation are severely hindered by contamination from astrophysical foreground emission and instrumental noise that are several orders of magnitude brighter than the signal of interest. A promising way to tackle these challenges is to cross-correlate the 21cm signal with other independent tracers of large-scale structure, most notably high-redshift galaxies. Besides validating putative 21cm detections, such joint analyses are expected to provide independent insights into the properties of ionizing sources and the evolving morphology of ionized regions during reionization. The 21cm signal, however, is intrinsically highly non-Gaussian, limiting the effectiveness of conventional two-point cross-correlation statistics, which capture information only up to the second order. In this work, we therefore investigate the utility of k-nearest-neighbour cumulative distribution functions (kNN CDF), which encode information from the joint clustering at all orders, as an alternative framework for probing 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations. Using self-consistently simulated mock 21cm fields and a catalog of line-emitting galaxies at z = 7, we conducted a proof-of-concept study comparing the kNN CDF formalism and the two-point cross-correlation approach. We find that the kNN CDF statistics outperform the two-point statistics in detecting 21cm-galaxy cross-correlations, even in the presence of instrumental noise and aggressive foreground filtering. Moreover, at a fixed global ionized fraction, it is even able to differentiate between reionization models that remain indistinguishable using two-point statistics. These results demonstrate the power and unexplored potential of exploiting higher-order statistics for extracting maximal information from 21cm-galaxy synergies."}

Existing studies of gravitational wave production from evaporating PBHs typically assume vacuum evaporation, neglecting the fact that PBHs in the early Universe are embedded in a hot thermal plasma. In this work, we investigate gravitational wave production from primordial black holes whose evaporation is thermally influenced by their surrounding environment. We adopt a thermal evaporation framework in which interactions with the ambient plasma modify the effective decay rate of the black hole, leading to enhanced mass loss at early times and a redistribution of the evaporation history compared to the standard non-thermal vacuum case. Since graviton emission is intrinsically tied to the evaporation history of PBHs, these thermal effects play a crucial role in determining the timing and spectral properties of the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background. Our results provide a consistent framework for incorporating thermal effects into gravitational wave production from evaporating primordial black holes and set the stage for a detailed analysis of their observational signatures."}

Research conducted as part of the RECA Internship Program 2025 (https://www.astroreca.org/en/internship)", "summary": "We present the development of a data-driven, AI-based model of the Point Spread Function (PSF) that achieves higher accuracy than the current state-of-the-art approach, \"PSF in the Full Field-of-View'' (PIFF). PIFF is widely used in leading weak-lensing surveys, including the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey, and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The PSF characterizes how a point source, such as a star, is imaged after its light traverses the atmosphere and telescope optics, effectively representing the \"blurred fingerprint'' of the entire imaging system. Accurate PSF modeling is essential for weak gravitational lensing analyses, as biases in its estimation propagate directly into cosmic shear measurements -- one of the primary cosmological probes of the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of large-scale structure for dark energy studies. To address the limitations of PIFF, which constructs PSF models independently for each CCD and therefore loses spatial coherence across the focal plane, we introduce a deep-learning-based framework for PSF reconstruction. In this approach, an autoencoder is trained on stellar images obtained with the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) of the Subaru Telescope and combined with a Gaussian process to interpolate the PSF across the telescope's full field of view. This hybrid model captures systematic variations across the focal plane and achieves a reconstruction error of $3.4 \\times 10^{-6}$ compared to PIFF's $3.7 \\times 10^{-6}$, laying the foundation for integration into the LSST Science Pipelines."}

In this paper, we show that in a broad class of single-field inflation models with sufficiently small energy scales, an extremely efficient tachyonic instability develops at the end of inflation. This instability rapidly drives the system into a nonlinear regime before coherent oscillations can be established, leading to a first-order phase-transition--like phenomenon without tunneling or barrier crossing. The resulting ultra-relativistic shock fronts surrounding the bubble interiors expand to near the Hubble scale, corresponding to the most strongly enhanced tachyonic modes, and collide with one another, producing energetic inflaton particles and gravitational waves. As a result, the post-inflationary dynamics can differ significantly from the conventional high-scale inflationary scenario. Interestingly, inflation at MeV--EeV energy scales can be probed via gravitational-wave observations, including pulsar timing arrays, ground-based detectors, and future space-based experiments. Recent limits from the LIGO--KAGRA--Virgo collaboration already constrain EeV-scale inflation, while pulsar timing array results may be interpreted as evidence for gravitational waves generated by GeV-scale inflation. We also briefly discuss further implications of the resulting tachyonic shocks."}
