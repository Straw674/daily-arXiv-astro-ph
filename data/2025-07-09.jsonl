Ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at\nintermediate redshifts ($3 < z < 5$) currently present one of the most pressing\nproblems for theoretical modeling, since very few mechanisms can be invoked to\nexplain how such galaxies formed so early in the history of the Universe. Here,\nwe exploit the fact that these galaxies all reside within significant\noverdensities to explain their masses. To this end, we construct and release a\nmodified version of the Extreme Value Statistics (EVS) code which takes into\naccount galaxy environment by incorporating clustering in the calculation. With\nthis new version of EVS, we find that ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at\n$3<z<5$ do not present as serious a tension with simple models of galaxy\nformation when the analysis of a given galaxy is conditioned on its\nenvironment."}

Our comparison\nshows minimal differences in the elliptical host galaxies, but significant\nvariations in the physical properties of satellite galaxies. The weak SN\nfeedback model produces a larger number of satellite galaxies compared to the\nFiducial model, and significantly more than observed. For satellite galaxies\nwith stellar masses above $10^{8}$ $M_{\\odot}$, the weak SN feedback model\ngenerates approximately five times more satellites than observed in the xSAGA\nsurvey.

The detection of H$_2$S\nices, which are thought to be one of the main sulfur reservoirs, has not been\nachieved yet, and the only S-bearing species detected in the ices to date is\nOCS. PRODIGE large survey observations with NOEMA of several Class 0/I\nprotostars in the Perseus Molecular Cloud provide a perfect opportunity to\nstudy the H$_2$S and OCS composition of the ices through the volatiles\nsublimated in the warm inner core (T$>$100K, n $\\sim10^6$cm$^{-3}$) of these\nprotostars. Our aim is to determine the H$_2$S/OCS ratio in the warm inner core\nof 24 protostars in order to study how it is affected by different factors\nduring its evolution. We used the NOEMA millimeter observations from the\nPRODIGE program of H$_2$S, H$_2^{33}$S, OCS, OC$^{33}$S and OC$^{34}$S to\nestimate the H$_2$S and OCS column densities in the warm inner cores. We used\nSO and SO$_2$ data from the ALMA archive to give a rough estimate of the total\nsulfur abundance. We explore the chemistry of H$_2$S and OCS in the warm cores\nusing chemical and dynamical simulations of the collapse of a dense core to\nform a protostar. The estimated H$_2$S/OCS ratio reveals a segregation of the\nsources into ``OCS-poor'' and ``OCS-rich'' protostars, where the OCS-poor\nprotostars present higher H$_2$S/OCS ratios than the OCS-rich ones. Total\nsulfur abundance is always dominated by either H$_2$S or OCS, grows with\nevolution during the Class 0 phase up to $D_S<8$, and decreases again in the\nClass I. Simulations show that temperature changes in the pre-stellar phase and\nduring the collapse can produce substantial differences in the H$_2$S and OCS\nabundances and in the H$_2$S/OCS ratio. Our analysis shows that the H$_2$S/OCS\nratio is strongly influenced by the environment and the initial conditions of\nthe cloud."}

Its\nbrightness suggests a maximum radius of ~10km (A/0.05)^{-1/2} for an asteroid\nwith an albedo A. I show that interstellar objects with that radius would\namount to an interstellar mass density that is well above the expected mass\nbudget of interstellar comets or asteroids. Given this budget, the detection\nrate of objects like 3I/ATLAS implies that it is a comet with a small core\nradius <0.6km, or a member of a rare population with a number density\n<5x10^{-8}au^{-3}} for R<10km. The second possibility would suggest that the\nrare population of 3I/ATLAS objects favors plunging orbits towards the inner\nsolar system to accommodate their inferred detection rate."}

We have 163 magnetic targets in this sample, 87 of which\nare new discoveries, making this the largest volume-limited survey of magnetic\nwhite dwarfs to date. We discuss the distribution of multiple parameters,\nincluding mass, cooling age, and field strength. We find strong evidence of two\npopulations of magnetic white dwarfs that form through separate mechanisms\nbased on a cluster analysis of these parameters. The young, high mass objects\ntypically have high field strengths which indicate a merger origin, while old,\naverage mass objects have weaker fields that likely originated through a\ncrystallization-induced dynamo or previous evolution stages. When comparing\nyoung and old objects, two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests yield statistically\nsignificant differences between the field strengths and masses of the magnetic\ntargets. We use a Gaussian mixture model to identify where these populations\nlie in parameter space, and we find two groups centered at distinct cooling\nages, masses, and field strengths: 2.9 Gyr, 0.71 $M_{\\odot}$, 3.7 MG and 1.8\nGyr, 0.96 $M_{\\odot}$, 84 MG respectively. Our results further support the dual\nformation channel previously reported in the literature. The occurrence of\nmagnetism strongly correlates with the onset of crystallization. However, given\nthe breakout times required for a crystallization dynamo, we find that many of\nour older, average mass objects can be better explained with a core-convective\ndynamo that forms on the main-sequence."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "The growing evidence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) being present in the\nearly Universe poses challenges to their traditional formation pathways.\nSeparately, studies suggest that merging SMBH binaries with total masses\n$\\gtrsim 10^9 M_\\odot$ could be the primary sources of the nanohertz\ngravitational wave background detected by the Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs).\nOwing to their extreme masses, these SMBHs have a higher probability of forming\nearlier than their lower-mass counterparts. In this work, we provide a\nformalism to calculate the implications of early seeded SMBHs for the PTA\nsignal. As an application, we explore the two most prominent scenarios of\nhigh-$z$ SMBHs seeding mechanisms: direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) and\ncollapse of supermassive dark stars (SMDSs). We show that SMDS-seeded SMBHs,\nwith comoving seed number density of $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-3}) \\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-3}$\ncan be the dominant contributor to the PTA signal, with mass $> 10^9 M_\\odot$\nbinaries acquiring a peak merger rate at $z< 1$. By contrast, SMBHs seeded via\nthe DCBH channel may contribute only sub-dominantly unless produced with a much\nlarger number density than implied by numerical simulations. Our analysis\nfurther suggests that the seed number density should be $< \\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})\n\\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ in order to not over-predict the expected PTA signal."}

As a result, we\ndiscovered six previously uncatalogued variable stars, including RS~CVn, BY\nDraconis, ellipsoidal, and solar-type variables, and refined classifications\nand periods for six known objects.
