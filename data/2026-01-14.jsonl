Gas accretion onto stellar black hole clusters in galactic central molecular zones", "categories": ["astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "To be published in Astronomy & Astrophysics; 6 pages, 2 figures", "summary": "The stellar dynamical evolution of massive star clusters formed during starburst periods leads to the segregation of $\\gtrsim10^4 M_\\odot$ stellar-mass black hole sub-clusters in their centres. In gas-rich environments, such as galactic central molecular zones, these black hole clusters are likely to accrete large amounts of the gas from their surroundings, which in turn affects their internal dynamics. In this Letter we estimated the corresponding accretion rate onto the black hole cluster and its radiative feedback. We assessed whether such an accretion flow can lead to the collapse of the black hole cluster into an intermediate-mass black hole. The estimates were obtained analytically, considering the astrophysical conditions and star formation history reported for the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. We find that a stellar black hole cluster with mass $\\gtrsim10^4 M_\\odot$ located in the twisted ring of molecular clouds with radius $\\approx100$ pc that is observed in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy can accrete about the same mass in gas on a timescale of a few million years. We suggest that this is sufficient for its subsequent collapse into an intermediate-mass black hole. Based on an estimate of the dynamical friction inspiral time, we further argue that the locations of the intermediate-mass black hole candidates recently observed in the central molecular zone are compatible with their formation therein during the last starburst period reported to have occurred $\\approx1$ Gyr ago."}

In this work, we present the first systematic search for molecules in the Milky Way wind. We use the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) to observe the 12CO(2-1) emission line in 19 fields centered on previously known high-velocity atomic hydrogen (HI) clouds associated with the outflow. Over 200 CO clumps are detected within 16 different HI clouds. These clumps have typical radii of 1 - 3 parsec, high velocity dispersions of 1 - 6 km/s and molecular gas masses ranging from a few to several hundred solar masses. Molecular clumps in the wind sit on the low-mass end of the mass - size relation of regular molecular clouds, but are far displaced from the mass (or size) - linewidth relation, being generally more turbulent and showing high internal pressures. Nearly 90% of the clumps are gravitationally unbound with virial parameters >> 10 - 100, indicating that these structures are either being disrupted or they must be confined by external pressure from the surrounding hot medium. While the observed properties of CO clumps do not seem to evolve clearly with latitude, we find that molecular gas is not detected in any of the 6 HI clouds with projected distances over 1 kpc from the Galactic Center, suggesting the existence of a maximum timescale of ~ 3 Myr for the dissociation of molecular gas within the wind. Overall, current observations in the Galactic center support a scenario in which a hot wind entrains cold gas clouds from the disk, driving their progressive transformation from molecular to atomic and ultimately ionized gas through stripping, turbulence, and dissociation."}

Combining strong and weak lensing data for massive clusters, we map their total mass--dominated by dark matter--over the dynamic range needed to confront small-scale predictions for collisionless cold dark matter (CDM). Using state-of-the-art lens models, we extract four key subhalo properties: the mass function, projected radial distribution, internal density profile, and tidal truncation radius. We find that the subhalo mass function and truncation radii are consistent with CDM expectations. In contrast, the inner density profiles and radial distribution of subhalos are strongly discrepant with CDM. The incidence of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) from subhalo cores exceeds CDM predictions by nearly an order of magnitude, requiring inner density slopes as steep as $γ\\gtrsim 2.5$ within $r \\lesssim 0.01\\,R_{200}$ consistent with core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), while the same subhalos behave as collisionless in their outskirts. Additionally, the observed radial distribution of subhalos hosting bright cluster member galaxies, explicitly modeled in the lens reconstructions, remains incompatible with CDM. Together, these small-scale stress tests reveal an intriguing paradox and challenge the dark matter microphysics of purely collisionless CDM and motivate hybrid scenarios, such as a dual-component model with both CDM and SIDM, or entirely new classes of dark matter theories."}

The background contamination and statistical fluctuations of typical astronomical images make this a challenging statistical task, particularly for X-ray images with low surface brightness. We develop a three-step Bayesian procedure to identify the boundaries of irregularly shaped sources. We first apply a Bayesian multiscale reconstruction algorithm known as LIRA to obtain posterior pixelwise probability distributions of the source intensity that properly account for known structures, astrophysical background, and the effect of the telescope point spread function. Next, we adopt an Ising model to group pixels with similar intensities into cohesive regions corresponding to background and source. Finally, the boundary is derived on the basis of the most likely aggregation of pixels into the source region. Because the overall model combines LIRA and the Ising model, we call it LIRA-Ising. We verify the proposed method using a set of simulation studies. We then apply it to the Chandra X-ray Observatory images of two high redshift quasars, PKS J1421-0643 and 0730+257, to determine the extent and morphology of X-ray jets. Our method shows a uniform X-ray surface brightness of PKS J1421-0643 jet, and identifies knotty structure in the X-ray jet of 0730+257."}

We present a self-consistent linear-perturbation analysis taking into account pressure and density gradients in the background medium. We explore two different steady-state configurations for the unperturbed gas: hydrostatic equilibrium and infall into a gravitational potential well. We show that in both cases the instability criterion is the classical Jeans criterion, which, contrary to previous claims, is not modified by the presence of the external gravitational field. While in the case of hydrostatic equilibrium linear local perturbations are always gravitationally stable, the conditions for gravitational instability can be met in the case of infalling gas, also in the presence of additional non-gravitational forces such as that due to a wind. We conclude that the Jeans criterion can have a role in regulating the formation of clumps and star clusters in streams or shells of gas infalling into galactic gravitational potential wells, as well as, on smaller scales, the fragmentation of gas in collapsing molecular clouds."}

RFI mitigation algorithms aim to remove this interference and improve the chance of detection of transients, but with the growing number of techniques, selecting the most appropriate method for a given survey can be problematic. The choice of method is particularly important in real-time searches planned for next-generation telescopes such as those of the SKAO, where there is no possibility to reprocess the data. In this paper, we explore the algorithm selection problem by injecting pulses into data which simulates several RFI environments. A set of these files is then cleaned using RFI mitigation algorithms and run through a single pulse search pipeline to analyse the recovery of the injected pulses. We examine the recovery of the injected single pulses with an emphasis on a number of cases spanning a range of pulse brightness, width and dispersion measure. The efficacy and side effects of a few popular RFI excision methods, namely IQRM, SKF, and ZDMF are evaluated."}

Cosmic voids are underdense regions of the Universe that provide a unique environment to study galaxy evolution in relative isolation. Galaxy triplets in voids are rare systems where local interactions may strongly influence galaxy properties.\n  Aims. We study the stellar populations, morphologies, mass assembly histories, and dynamical properties of six galaxies belonging to two void triplets from the Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY): CAVITY5273X and VGS31.\n  Methods. We used integral-field unit spectroscopy and performed full spectral fitting with the FADO code, which models stellar and nebular emission simultaneously. Spatially resolved maps of stellar age, metallicity, and star formation rate were reconstructed using the integrated nested Laplace approximation. Morphological properties were derived using morfometryka, emission-line diagnostics were applied, and mass assembly functions were computed. Stellar masses and metallicities were compared to the mass-metallicity relation for void galaxies.\n  Results. The two triplets show different evolutionary behaviours. CAVITY52731 is a massive quenched galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus, while its companions and all galaxies in VGS31 are dominated by young stellar populations and recent star formation. Five galaxies experienced rapid stellar mass growth in the last 2 Gyr. Disturbed morphologies, including asymmetries and tidal features, indicate ongoing interactions. Galaxies in CAVITY5273X follow the expected void mass-metallicity relation, while VGS31 members show significant deviations.\n  Conclusions.

Future higher contrast systems, like the Extremely Large Telescope's Planetary Camera System, will require higher performance wavefront sensing. A further performance improvement could be achieved with a polychromatic pyramid wavefront sensor by using additional information over a broader wavelength range. The development of such systems is becoming more feasible with the emergence of new detector technologies such as Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector arrays. These are arrays of superconductor detectors that give a position, arrival time and measure of the energy for each incident photon. This paper introduces the polychromatic pyramid wavefront sensor concept by defining the technologies and techniques employed and their requirements. A method is developed to track the optical gains, taking advantage of the additional wavelength information, and used to compensate for optical gains within an optimised reconstructor to minimise noise propagation. An overview of expected performance improvement, using end-to-end simulations, is provided using the Keck II adaptive optics system as a reference design. The polychromatic pyramid wavefront sensor was shown to increase the limiting magnitude by 1 to 2 magnitudes, and the contrast by factors of 1.5 to 4, versus single band pyramid wavefront sensors, by sensing over a wavelength range approximately five to ten times broader (800-1800 nm) compared to Z band (152 nm wide) and H band (300 nm wide).

We find that, compared to higher-luminosity AGN, these low-luminosity AGN exhibit distinct properties in their emission of ionized gas, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and molecular hydrogen (H$_2$). Specifically, the low-luminosity AGN exhibit relatively weak high-ionization potential lines (e.g., [Ne V] and [O IV]), and the line ratios suggest that fast radiative shocks (with $v_{\\rm s}$ of $\\sim \\rm 100s\\,km\\,s^{-1}$) are the primary excitation source of ionized gas therein. Under the low-excitation conditions of their nuclear regions, these low-luminosity AGN generally exhibit a higher fraction of PAHs with large size ($N_{\\rm C} \\gtrsim 200$), reflecting the preferential destruction of smaller PAH molecules by AGN feedback. Furthermore, the H$_2$ transitions in these low-luminosity AGN are not fully thermalized, with slow, plausibly jet-driven molecular shocks (with $v_{\\rm s} \\leq \\rm 10\\,km\\,s^{-1}$) likely being the extra excitation source. Taken together with results from the literature, these findings indicate that feedback operates in both low- and high-luminosity AGN, albeit its impact varies with AGN luminosity. In particular, systematic variations in PAH band ratios are found across AGN, demonstrating the differing influence of feedback in AGN of varying luminosities and highlighting the potential of PAH band ratios as diagnostics for distinguishing kinetic- and radiative-mode AGN feedback."}

Our goal is to evaluate its performance against the number of training images, classical Tikhonov deconvolution and to assess its generalization capability under varying seeing conditions and noise levels.\n  Methods: Realistic astronomical observations are simulated using the GalSim toolkit, incorporating random transformations, PSF convolution (accounting for both optical and atmospheric effects), and Gaussian white noise. A U-Net model is trained using a Mean Square Error (MSE) loss function on datasets of varying sizes, up to 40,000 images of size 48x48 from the COSMOS Real Galaxy Dataset. Performance is evaluated using PSNR, SSIM, and cosine similarity metrics, with the latter employed in a two-model framework to assess solution stability.\n  Results: The U-Net model demonstrates effectiveness in blind deconvolution, with performance improving consistently as the training dataset size increases, saturating beyond 5,000 images. Cosine similarity analysis reveals convergence between independently trained models, indicating stable solutions. Remarkably, the U-Net outperforms the oracle-like Tikhonov method in challenging conditions (low PSNR/medium SSIM). The model also generalizes well to unseen seeing and noise conditions, although optimal performance is achieved when training parameters include validation conditions. Experiments on synthetic $C^α$ images further support the hypothesis that the U-Net learns a geometry-adaptive harmonic basis, akin to sparse representations observed in denoising tasks. These results align with recent mathematical insights into its adaptive learning capabilities."}

To be submitted to OJA", "summary": "We revisit the Great Attractor using the Manticore-Local suite of digital twins of the nearby Universe. The Great Attractor concept has been proposed as an answer to three distinct questions: what sources the Local Group velocity in the cosmic microwave background frame, where present-day velocity streamlines converge, and where the Local Group is moving to. Addressing the original motivation of the Great Attractor -- explaining the Local Group cosmic velocity -- we find that mass within $155~h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ accounts for only ${\\sim}72\\%$ of that velocity magnitude with ${\\sim}38\\,°$ directional offset. We show that even in the purely linear regime convergence within this volume is not guaranteed, particularly when also accounting for small-scale contributions to the observer velocity; no single structure, including the proposed Great Attractor, would be expected to dominate the velocity budget. Streamline convergence is smoothing-scale-dependent, transitioning from Virgo at small scales through the Hydra--Centaurus region at intermediate scales to Shapley at large scales; at intermediate smoothing the convergence point lies near Abell 3565 with an asymmetric basin of mass $\\log( M / (h^{-1} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot)) = 16.4 \\pm 0.1$ that excludes Norma. To address the third question, we evolve the Manticore-Local realisations to scale factor $a = 10$ in a new Beyond-Present-Time simulation suite and identify the asymptotic future location of the Local Group. We find that the dominant motion is towards Virgo, but even it contributes at most one third of the Local Group velocity. Our results demonstrate that the classical Great Attractor is not a dynamically dominant structure but an artifact of the instantaneous velocity field, and that no single attractor is likely to account for the Local Group motion in the cosmic rest frame."}

However, the mechanisms driving their quenching remain elusive. We conduct a multi-wavelength analysis of 155 RQEs, along with their precursors (preRQEs) and descendants (postRQEs), focusing on their neutral hydrogen (HI) content and star formation properties. Contrary to conventional quenching models emphasizing gas depletion, RQEs retain substantial HI reservoirs ($f_{\\text{gas}} \\geq 17\\%$), suggesting that quenching is not primarily driven by gas exhaustion. We identify a critical halo mass threshold at $\\log M_{\\text{halo}} = 12.1 M_{\\odot}$, delineating different evolutionary pathways for RQEs. This threshold aligns with the transition from cold-mode to hot-mode gas accretion in theoretical models. RQEs in lower-mass halos ($\\log M_{\\text{halo}} < 12.1 M_{\\odot}$) likely experience rapid quenching, possibly initiated by major mergers, followed by brief AGN activity and sustained LINER emission. We propose two evolutionary pathways: (a) rapid quenching via major mergers followed by AGN/LINER activity and passive evolution, and (b) rapid quenching followed by rejuvenation through minor mergers before evolving into more massive, long-term quenched ellipticals. These results challenge the conventional understanding of galaxy quenching, especially in low-density environments where RQEs typically reside. Our findings suggest that while RQEs may follow a rapid quenching pathway, their evolution is influenced by interactions between gas accretion modes, feedback mechanisms, and environmental factors. Future observations with advanced radio interferometers like SKA will be crucial for elucidating the quenching mechanisms in RQEs and their role in galaxy evolution."}

Most implementations use either Jacobi coordinates or democratic heliocentric coordinates (DHC) for the Hamiltonian splitting, resulting in slightly different algorithms. In this paper we report results from numerical experiments, which show that integrations of the Solar System using DHC coordinates with typical timesteps of a few days suppress instabilities of the planet Mercury. We further show that this is due to an eccentricity dependent artificial numerical precession introduced by the DHC splitting. While the DHC splitting converges to the correct results at shorter timesteps of ~0.6 days, we argue that Jacobi coordinates remain reliable to significantly longer timesteps when orbits become moderately eccentric, and are thus a better choice when the innermost planet can reach high eccentricities."}

We employ Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to reconstruct the calibration relation directly from the data.

The calibrated GRB sample is used to constrain the Amati relation, and we systematically compare the outcomes obtained from different calibration techniques and datasets.

Depending on selection method, observing wavelength, and brightness, AGNs are assigned distinct labels, yet the relationship between different selection methods and the diversity of time-domain behavior within and across classes remains difficult to characterize in a unified framework. Changing-look AGNs (CLAGNs), which transition between classifications over time, further complicate this picture. In this work, we learn a data-driven, low-dimensional representation of multi-wavelength photometric light curves of AGNs, in which the structure of the projected manifold correlates with AGN class and independent spectroscopic properties. Using the NASA Fornax Science Platform, we assemble light curves from ZTF, Pan-STARRS, Gaia, and WISE/NEOWISE for two samples: (1) a heterogeneous set of $\\sim$2000 AGNs spanning $z \\lesssim 1$, including SDSS quasars, variability-selected sources, and CLAGNs; and (2) a homogeneous sample of $\\sim$65000 narrow-line AGNs at $z \\approx 0.1$ with well-characterized optical emission-line measurements. Without using class labels during training, the learned manifolds organize variability-selected AGNs into coherent regions of the low-dimensional space, distinguish between turn-on and turn-off CLAGNs, and place tidal disruption events in distinct regions. Manifold coordinates correlate with key spectroscopic and host-galaxy properties, including stellar mass, [OIII] luminosity, and D$_n$(4000), demonstrating that heterogeneous multi-band variability can be combined in a purely data-driven manner to recover correlations with independent physical diagnostics, without requiring explicit physical modeling. These results show that manifold learning offers a practical, assumption-light approach for integrating time-domain surveys and prioritizing spectroscopic follow-up."}

Using 80 BBH mergers selected for adequate localization, redshift reach, observing-epoch overlap, and ZTF sky coverage, we construct a likelihood for the flare-associated fraction, $f_{\\rm flare}$, that combines each event's 3D localization with a locally estimated flare number density derived from a 3D Voronoi tessellation, while explicitly accounting for survey boundaries and incomplete catalog coverage.

In earlier papers in this series we have shown that a significant fraction of metals newly synthesized by type II supernovae are promptly lost to galactic winds -- i.e., galactic winds are metal loaded. Here we investigate whether the elements returned by type Ia supernovae and AGB stars are similarly metal loaded, or whether metal loading varies significantly with nucleosynthetic site. We use a series of high-resolution ``tall box'' simulations of the interstellar medium with the \\quokka~GPU-accelerated code, within which we systematically vary the galaxy gas surface density, metallicity, and the scale heights and relative rates of the different nucleosynthetic sources. We show that the metal loadings of galactic winds differ substantially between metals produced by different sources, with typical variations at the level of $\\approx 0.3$ dex, a phenomenon we term differential metal loading. Which set of metals suffers preferential loss from this phenomenon varies depending on the galactic environment, and is not easily predictable \\textit{a priori}.

We present RotCurves, a parametric forward-modeling tool designed for rotation curve analysis at high-z, correcting for ``beam smearing\" by projecting and convolving the beam PSF in the plane of the galaxy. We benchmark RotCurves against the established parametric code dysmalpy using synthetic observations. The typical runtime with RotCurves is a few ~10ms, a factor 250 faster than dysmalpy for a single realization. For well-resolved systems (PSF FWHM < Reff), the mock observed rotation and dispersion curves agree to within 5% up to 3Reff, where most of the discrepancies are in the inner disk. whereas in marginally resolved systems (PSF FWHM > 1.5 Reff) discrepancies increase to up to 15%. Using a built-in MCMC fitting procedure, RotCurves recovers well the intrinsic model parameters across a wide range of galaxy properties and accounting for realistic noise patterns. Systematic biases emerge for the effective radius and for low disk masses (Mdisk < 3x10^9 Msun). We show excellent parameter recovery at high signal-to-noise ratios (S/N > 25), with increasing deviations in parameter recovery at lower S/N.

Accurately accounting for the effects of aerosols is key to reconstructing atmospheric properties from transit spectra, yet this remains a significant challenge. To advance this effort, it is invaluable to examine the spectral features of well-characterized planetary atmospheres. Here, we synthesize empirical transit spectra of Mars across different seasons based on data from the NOMAD's Solar Occultation channel onboard ExoMars/TGO, which operates at wavelengths of 0.2-0.65 and 2-4 micron. In the generated empirical transit spectra, the atmosphere below 25 km is found to be largely opaque due to the presence of micron-sized dust and water ice clouds, both of which substantially weaken spectral features. The spectra exhibit CO2 absorption features at 2.7-2.8 micron and signatures of sub-micron-sized mesospheric water ice clouds around 3.1 micron, accompanied by a continuum slope. The amplitudes of these spectral features are found to vary with the Martian seasons, where the dust storms weaken the CO2 signatures and strengthen the water ice features, which serve as potential indicators of a dusty planet like Mars. If TRAPPIST-1f possessed a Mars-like atmospheric structure, both CO2 and water ice features would be detectable at a noise level of 3 ppm, a level likely beyond current observational capabilities. Nevertheless, the 3.1 micron feature produced by sub-micron-sized mesospheric water ice clouds offers a novel avenue for characterizing the atmospheres of habitable-zone exoplanets."}

Our uGMRT images reveals an interesting diffuse emission surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), with its edge spatially coinciding with the sloshing cold front and roughly with the cooling radius. Furthermore, a low star formation rate and uniform metal abundance up to the sloshing edge are consistent with the earlier findings of suppression of star formation and metallicity homogenisation by mixing core gas through sloshing. Finally, the spatial correlation between the mini-halo and the observed X-ray features indicates that ICM sloshing, rather than AGN feedback, plays a dominant role in powering the proposed radio mini-halo emission."}

A recent population study of optical variables by Anderson & Hunt 2025 shows that the population of optical variables in open clusters clearly changes over cluster age; this pilot study gives evidence that the X-ray population also changes with time, and demonstrates the need for a broader multiwavelength study of Galactic open clusters."}

Understanding their structure and dynamics-particularly during and after breakout from the merger ejecta-is crucial for interpreting GRB afterglows, especially for off-axis observers. Traditional models often assume simple angular or radial jet profiles, potentially missing key features emerging for jets piercing through realistic environments. This work aims to investigate the formation and evolution of the jet structure as it propagates through a non-homogeneous, anisotropic BNS merger environment. We focus on how the interaction with the ambient medium shapes the jet's angular and velocity distributions and assess the impact of this realistic structure on the resulting afterglow light curves. We perform a series of 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jets launched in post-merger environments, exploring different injection conditions. Simulations are evolved to late times, approaching the ballistic regime, where further dynamical evolution becomes negligible. From the resulting outflows, we extract energy and velocity profiles and compute multi-wavelength afterglow light curves using a semi-analytic model that includes radial stratification and the full 3D jet geometry. More energetic or earlier-launched jets drill more efficiently through the ejecta, but all develop asymmetries that leave clear imprints in the off-axis afterglow light curves. All models exhibit a complex multi-shock breakout structure responsible for an early, dimmer peak in the afterglow. Despite structural differences, all simulated jets are consistent with the observational data of the multi-messenger BNS merger event GW170817."}

Starting from a universally conformally coupled matter sector, we rewrite the field equations in terms of the invariant set $\\{{\\cal I}_1,{\\cal I}_2,{\\cal I}_3,\\hat g_{μν}\\}$, so that Machian requirements can be stated independently of conformal frame. Sciama's causal postulate is implemented not by modifying the local dynamics, but as a selection rule on the solution space of the invariant scalar equation: the admissible configuration is the retarded response to the matter distribution in the causal past, with any source-free contribution removed. In a spatially flat FLRW universe, and in the light, slowly varying regime, the prescription reduces to an explicit temporal kernel that links the background scalar evolution to the matter content within the Hubble region, reproducing the expected Machian scaling in an expanding background. Universal coupling to a single physical metric implies that structureless test bodies share the same acceleration in a given external configuration, so that the Eötvs parameter vanishes at leading order. Nonuniversal effects can arise only when gravitational binding energy contributes appreciably to the total mass, as in strongly self-gravitating objects. Thus, the theory implements a causal Machian determination of the cosmological inertial scale while remaining consistent with standard weak-field tests."}

However, we recently found several heavily-obscured ($A_V > 50$ mag) AGNs with broad H$α$ detections: MCG -3-34-64, UGC 5101, and Mrk 268. To investigate the origin of the observed broad line in these AGNs, we performed multi-epoch optical spectroscopic observations to search for flux variability of the broad H$α$ line. For MCG -3-34-64 and UGC 5101, no significant variability was detected, suggesting that the broad line of these AGNs may arise from sources other than the BLR. Spectral fitting analysis suggests possible large contribution of ionized outflows to the observed broad component of MCG -3-34-64, while both the outflow and scattering by polar material can explain that of UGC 5101. For Mrk 268, we detected a significant ($4.3σ$) flux variation of the broad H$α$ line by using the flux ratio of the H$α$ complex and the [SII]$λ\\lambda6716$, 6731 doublet, indicating that the broad line originates directly from the BLR. The lack of significant flux variation in the optical continuum implies that the line of sight to the nucleus of Mrk 268 is mildly obscured. Our results demonstrate that the observed broad H$α$ lines in obscured AGNs likely have multiple origins. Such complexity may introduce additional uncertainties in black hole mass measurements of distant AGNs revealed by e.g., JWST."}

Accepted to MNRAS", "summary": "Rotation curves are a fundamental tool in the study of galaxies across cosmic time, and with the advent of large integral field unit (IFU) kinematic surveys there is an increasing need for efficient and flexible modelling tools. We present RotCurves, a parametric forward-modeling tool designed for rotation curve analysis at high-z, correcting for ``beam smearing\" by projecting and convolving the beam PSF in the plane of the galaxy. We benchmark RotCurves against the established parametric code dysmalpy using synthetic observations. The typical runtime with RotCurves is a few ~10ms, a factor 250 faster than dysmalpy for a single realization. For well-resolved systems (PSF FWHM < Reff), the mock observed rotation and dispersion curves agree to within 5% up to 3Reff, where most of the discrepancies are in the inner disk. whereas in marginally resolved systems (PSF FWHM > 1.5 Reff) discrepancies increase to up to 15%. Using a built-in MCMC fitting procedure, RotCurves recovers well the intrinsic model parameters across a wide range of galaxy properties and accounting for realistic noise patterns. Systematic biases emerge for the effective radius and for low disk masses (Mdisk < 3x10^9 Msun). We show excellent parameter recovery at high signal-to-noise ratios (S/N > 25), with increasing deviations in parameter recovery at lower S/N. RotCurves is best suited for inclinations of 10 < i < 80. RotCurves is built as an exploratory tool for rapid testing of mass model assumptions, parameter studies and for efficiently processing large samples of observational data from large IFU surveys. The code is publicly available on github."}

In this paper we show that these difficulties arise from the abruptness of the truncation rather than from the finite extent itself. We introduce a general and infinitely differentiable radial truncation scheme that can be applied to any density profile, and illustrate its behaviour using the Hernquist model. We find that softly truncated models are dynamically consistent provided that the truncation is sufficiently gradual, and we determine the corresponding critical truncation sharpness. Their distribution functions display a characteristic bump-dip feature near the truncation energy that signals the transition between consistent and inconsistent cases. In contrast to sharply truncated models, softly truncated systems can support an extensive family of Osipkov-Merritt orbital structures, including moderately radial ones. Soft truncations therefore offer a general and physically motivated route to constructing finite-extent dynamical models with well-controlled outer-edge behaviour."}

The rotation curve was selected in such a way that there would be no dominant burst of circular velocities in the central ($R<2$ kpc) region of the Galaxy. As a result, we constructed two two-component models of the galactic potential, which include contributions from the disk and the halo of invisible matter, as well as a three-component model with a small-mass bulge added in advance.

We analyse the stellar masses using different modelling assumptions and with new data of three galaxies (S1, S2 and S3), whose NIRCam/grism redshifts were consistent with $z>5$. These three optically dark galaxies have previously been reported to host exceptionally high stellar masses and star-formation rates, implying extremely high star-formation efficiencies. Recent NIRSpec/IFU observations for S1 indicate a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\\rm spec}=3.2461^{+0.0001}_{-0.0002}$, which is lower than previously reported. Using the Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling tool \\texttt{Prospector}, we investigate the impact of key model assumptions on stellar mass estimates, such as the choice of star-formation history (SFH) priors (constant versus rising SFH base for the non-parametric prior), the dust attenuation law, and the treatment of emission line fluxes. Our analysis yields revised stellar masses of $\\log(M_{\\star}/M_{\\odot}) \\approx 10.36^{+0.47}_{-0.32}, 10.95^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ and $10.31^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$ for S1, S2, and S3, respectively. We find that adopting a rising SFH base prior results in lower inferred stellar masses compared to a constant SFH base prior. We identify a significant degeneracy between the dust attenuation curve slope, the amount of dust attenuation, and stellar mass. Our results highlight various systematics in SED modelling due to SFH priors and dust attenuation that can influence stellar mass estimates of heavily dust obscured sources.

Combining strong and weak lensing data for massive clusters, we map their total mass--dominated by dark matter--over the dynamic range needed to confront small-scale predictions for collisionless cold dark matter (CDM). Using state-of-the-art lens models, we extract four key subhalo properties: the mass function, projected radial distribution, internal density profile, and tidal truncation radius. We find that the subhalo mass function and truncation radii are consistent with CDM expectations. In contrast, the inner density profiles and radial distribution of subhalos are strongly discrepant with CDM. The incidence of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) from subhalo cores exceeds CDM predictions by nearly an order of magnitude, requiring inner density slopes as steep as $γ\\gtrsim 2.5$ within $r \\lesssim 0.01\\,R_{200}$ consistent with core-collapsed self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), while the same subhalos behave as collisionless in their outskirts. Additionally, the observed radial distribution of subhalos hosting bright cluster member galaxies, explicitly modeled in the lens reconstructions, remains incompatible with CDM. Together, these small-scale stress tests reveal an intriguing paradox and challenge the dark matter microphysics of purely collisionless CDM and motivate hybrid scenarios, such as a dual-component model with both CDM and SIDM, or entirely new classes of dark matter theories."}

By scanning rotation angles and reflection axes, we obtain TI curves whose local minima identify symmetry operations. We validate the method on a wind-rose pattern and then apply it to planetary nebulae, where the recovered axes trace bipolar and multipolar lobes consistent with morphology-based classifications. Applying TI to supernova remnants yields estimate axes associated with protrusions, rims, and substructure. To emphasize global morphology, we introduce a thresholded two-level variant that compares binary silhouettes and can reveal outline-driven symmetries. Finally, we quantify symmetry using a minima prominence-to-width score and show that this compact descriptor separates Type Ia and core-collapse remnants into distinct populations for an X-ray sample. TI provides a non-parametric, reproducible framework for symmetry identification, classification and population studies."}

Recent works suggest there are periods when the Sun encountered massive cold clouds which compressed the heliosphere to within Earth's orbit. This would expose Earth to increased galactic cosmic rays and MeV-energy particles of heliospheric origin. We model 10Be production in Earth's atmosphere during possible cold cloud encounters, and estimate their detectability in marine records of variable temporal resolution. We find that an AU-scale cold cloud encounter can be detected using ocean sediment measurements of 10Be if Earth spends time inside the compressed heliosphere. For typical relative speeds between the Sun and local interstellar clouds, this translates to a crossing time of ~100 years. A cloud must have an extension on the scale of parsecs to tens-of-parsecs (crossing time 0.1-1 Myr) to be detectable through 10Be measurements in iron-manganese crusts."}

We combine these with published values for stellar temperature, luminosity, rotation period, circumstellar disk status, and binarity; we are predominantly interested in how the last two factors may affect the rotation speeds of the stars. We find evidence to support theories that interaction with circumstellar disks may slow the rotation of TTSs compared to Class III stars in both clusters. We also identify a higher fraction of slow-rotating Class III stars in IC 348 compared to other clusters; we suggest that some fraction of these may be stars that recently lost their disks. We find that a higher fraction of binary stars are rapid rotators compared to single stars, though not to a statistically significant degree. We also combine our v sin i measurements with rotation periods to estimate projected stellar radii, which we compare to predictions from stellar evolution models using a maximum likelihood method. We continue to show that models with increasing starspot coverage reduce radius inflation and align better with published age estimates than models without starspots."}

The blazars Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 have shown multiwavelength variability on all observed timescales, and have been well studied at high energies on short timescales. We aim to characterise the long-term temporal behaviour of these blazars at synchrotron energies, namely optical, UV, and X-ray, in order to assess current models of these objects and their processes. Methods. Amongst the longest light curves ever studied for these sources, we investigated 20 years of data (2005-2025) from the Swift-UVOT and Swift-XRT telescopes. We examined spectral models, fractional variabilities, flux distributions, and X-ray photon index vs flux relations, as well as carrying out in-depth time series analysis using structure functions, Lomb-Scargle periodograms, and discrete correlation functions. Results. Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 both showed intriguing variability in all studied wavelengths; this variability has been found to be energy dependent, as has the trend of lognormality in flux distributions. X-ray photon indices fluctuated greatly throughout the entire period, showing an overall harder-when-brighter trend. Hints of a quasi-periodicity have been found in the X-ray of Mrk 501 (host frame time scale $\\sim390$ days, >3$σ$) but not in the UV or X-ray of Mrk 421, or in the UV of Mrk 501. No correlation at any time lag was found between the optical/UV and X-ray bands in either source."}

To be submitted to OJA", "summary": "We revisit the Great Attractor using the Manticore-Local suite of digital twins of the nearby Universe. The Great Attractor concept has been proposed as an answer to three distinct questions: what sources the Local Group velocity in the cosmic microwave background frame, where present-day velocity streamlines converge, and where the Local Group is moving to. Addressing the original motivation of the Great Attractor -- explaining the Local Group cosmic velocity -- we find that mass within $155~h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$ accounts for only ${\\sim}72\\%$ of that velocity magnitude with ${\\sim}38\\,°$ directional offset. We show that even in the purely linear regime convergence within this volume is not guaranteed, particularly when also accounting for small-scale contributions to the observer velocity; no single structure, including the proposed Great Attractor, would be expected to dominate the velocity budget. Streamline convergence is smoothing-scale-dependent, transitioning from Virgo at small scales through the Hydra--Centaurus region at intermediate scales to Shapley at large scales; at intermediate smoothing the convergence point lies near Abell 3565 with an asymmetric basin of mass $\\log( M / (h^{-1} \\mathrm{M}_\\odot)) = 16.4 \\pm 0.1$ that excludes Norma. To address the third question, we evolve the Manticore-Local realisations to scale factor $a = 10$ in a new Beyond-Present-Time simulation suite and identify the asymptotic future location of the Local Group. We find that the dominant motion is towards Virgo, but even it contributes at most one third of the Local Group velocity. Our results demonstrate that the classical Great Attractor is not a dynamically dominant structure but an artifact of the instantaneous velocity field, and that no single attractor is likely to account for the Local Group motion in the cosmic rest frame."}

We investigate the IMF in the young massive cluster RCW 36, located in the Vela Molecular Ridge and comparable to the Orion Nebula Cluster in stellar density. Our goal is to build the most complete census of RCW 36 and derive its first IMF and star-to-brown-dwarf (BD) ratio. We combine new GLAO observations from HAWK-I/VLT with archival data (2MASS, SOFI/NTT) and Gaia DR3 kinematics. Photometric accuracy and source extraction were improved using \\textsc{DeNeb}, a deep-learning algorithm that removes complex nebular emission. Membership probabilities were assigned via color-magnitude diagram comparisons with a control field, and stellar masses were estimated using model isochrones. We find a revised distance of $954\\pm40\\,$pc and determine the IMF down to $\\sim0.03\\,M_{\\odot}$, described by a broken power law ($dN/dM\\propto M^{-α}$) with $α=1.62\\pm0.03$ for $0.20$-$20\\,M_{\\odot}$ and $α=0.46\\pm0.14$ for $0.03$-$0.20\\,M_{\\odot}$. The star-BD ratio is $2$-$5$, consistent with other Galactic clusters. Lastly, through a study of the differences in the IMF within and outside $0.2\\,$pc and the cumulative mass distributions for low-mass and intermediate to high-mass sources, we also detected signs of possible mass segregation within RCW 36, which should be primordial. RCW 36 shares many characteristics with other young massive clusters, such as a shallower than Salpeter high-mass slope and the possibility of mass segregation. The flatter lower-mass regime of the IMF is similar to most Galactic clusters. The star-BD ratio is also in line with the observed values in other clusters, independent of their inherent properties."}

Using imaging polarimeters, we measured the degree of linear polarization from the visible RC band (0.64 μm) to the near-infrared KS band (2.25 μm), and investigated its dependence on solar phase angle (polarization phase curve; PPC) and wavelength (polarization color curve; PCC). We confirm that the PPC of 3I/ATLAS differs significantly from those of typical Solar System comets, showing an unusually large polarization amplitude. This PPC shows no significant change in the RC band across perihelion passage, despite the perihelion lying within the water snow line. This indicates that the unusual polarimetric behavior of 3I/ATLAS is unlikely to be driven by transient volatile activity, but instead reflects intrinsic optical properties of refractory dust particles. The PCC increases with wavelength over 0.6-1.2 μm and peaks at 1.5-2.0 μm, suggesting that the dominant scattering units are dust aggregates composed of submicron-sized monomers, broadly consistent with interstellar dust and solar-system cometary aggregates. Taken together, our results indicate that 3I/ATLAS preserves polarimetric properties characteristic of a primitive cometary planetesimal formed in another planetary system, with a refractory dust composition that differs from that typically observed among Solar System comets, despite sharing a similar size scale of the aggregate building blocks."}

Understanding the connection between thermal X-ray and non-thermal radio emission is key to uncovering their origin. Here, we present a multiwavelength study of the cool-core cluster RXCJ1558.3-1410 using archival Chandra X-ray and wideband uGMRT radio data (Bands 3, 4 and 5). Our improved analysis confirms a previously known X-ray cavity at $\\sim$36 kpc south-east of the cluster centre and we report a new cavity at $\\sim$42 kpc to the north-west. These cavities suggest that the AGN provides mechanical power of $\\sim$$6.0 \\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$, sufficient to offset radiative cooling in the ICM. We also detect a sharp surface brightness edge at $\\sim$72 kpc south-east of the centre, characterised by a temperature jump and pressure continuity, consistent with a cold front, likely caused by gas sloshing from a minor merger. Our uGMRT images reveals an interesting diffuse emission surrounding the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), with its edge spatially coinciding with the sloshing cold front and roughly with the cooling radius. Furthermore, a low star formation rate and uniform metal abundance up to the sloshing edge are consistent with the earlier findings of suppression of star formation and metallicity homogenisation by mixing core gas through sloshing. Finally, the spatial correlation between the mini-halo and the observed X-ray features indicates that ICM sloshing, rather than AGN feedback, plays a dominant role in powering the proposed radio mini-halo emission."}

However, their evolution and thus their ionizing feedback are still not fully understood. One of the largest gaps in current stellar evolution calculations is the lack of a model for the mass ejections that occur when the stars reach the Eddington limit, such as during an Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) phase. We aim to remedy this situation by providing a physically motivated and empirically calibrated method applicable in any 1D stellar evolution code to approximate the effect of such mass loss on stellar evolution. We employ the 1D stellar evolution code MESA, in which we implement a new mass-loss prescription that is acting when stellar models inflate too much when reaching the Eddington limit. Synthetic massive-star stellar populations using calculated grids of single-star models with this mass loss prescription are compared with the observed populations in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. In combination with already computed grids of binary evolution models, we investigate the impact of binarity on our predictions. Our single-star models reproduce key features of the observed stellar populations, namely (i) the absence of stars located beyond the Humphreys-Davidson limit, (ii) an upper limit of RSG luminosities, (iii) the faintest observed single WR stars, (iv) the absolute number of O-stars, WRs, and RSGs, (v) WO stars in low metallicity environments, and (vi) the positions of LBV stars in the HRD. Our binary population explains at the same time the 70% binary fraction of O-stars and the 40% binary fraction of WR stars. However, our synthetic population also has caveats, such as an overproduction of bright H-free WN stars. Our results show that the effect of Eddington-limit induced mass ejections on the structure and evolution of massive stars can remove tension between predicted and observed massive star populations."}
