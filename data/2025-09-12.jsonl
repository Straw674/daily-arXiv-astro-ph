Accepted as a Letter in Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "Understanding the interaction of dense, cold ejecta clumps with a fast\nreverse shock, an instance of the \"cloud-crushing\" problem, is essential to\nassess whether core-collapse supernovae act as net dust factories or net dust\ndestroyers. This work assesses whether dusty ejecta clumps are destroyed by the\nreverse shock or instead cool, condense, and grow in mass under realistic\nsupernova-remnant conditions. Cloud-crushing timescales are computed and\ncompared to radiative cooling timescales, including both gas-phase cooling and\ndust-induced cooling, for a large grid of clump densities, dust-to-gas mass\nratios, and shock velocities. When the dust-to-gas mass ratio exceeds\n$10^{-3}$, gas-grain collisions become efficient enough that the cooling\ntimescale $t_{\\rm cool}$ falls below the cloud-crushing timescale $t_{\\rm cc}$\nover a broad span of clump densities and shock velocities, enabling dusty\nclumps to survive even fast reverse shocks. For example, at clump densities\n$\\geq 2 \\times 10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$, dust-to-gas mass ratios $\\sim 10^{-2}$, and\nshock velocities up to $2000$ km s$^{-1}$, enhanced gas-grain cooling drives\nthe system into a regime where dusty clumps can gain additional cold mass and\nincrease their dust masses. Strong radiative cooling can shield dust-rich\nclumps in supernova remnants, enabling a significant fraction of ejecta dust to\nbe injected into the interstellar medium. These results mirror the \"growth\"\nregime found in studies of circumgalactic clouds and rapidly cooling shocked\nstellar winds, implying a larger dust survival in supernova remnants. Indeed,\nthe dusty globules seen in the Crab Nebula occupy the predicted survival regime\nacross a wide range of physical parameters."}

Through the void galaxy cross correlation function,\ncosmic voids, the underdense regions in the galaxy distribution, are used for\nrefined deductions of the Universe's content by correcting apparent geometric\ndistortions. This study proposes a novel procedure for optimally extracting the\nAlcock Paczynski, AP, signal from cosmic voids through a cosmological\nreconstruction technique. Employing cosmological reconstruction, specifically\nusing the Zel'dovich approximation, we estimate the true positions of galaxies\nfrom their redshift space locations, reducing distortions introduced by\npeculiar velocities. Unlike previous analyses, we identify voids and measure\nthe void galaxy cross correlation function directly in reconstructed space.\nThis approach enables us, for the first time, to include in our analysis small\nnonlinear voids, typically discarded in previous studies, thus enhancing the\nstatistical power of void studies and significantly improving their\ncosmological constraining power. Reconstruction is particularly effective even\nat small scales for voids, due to their clean and dynamically simple\nenvironment. This ability to recover information encoded on small scales\nsignificantly enhances the precision of the analysis, leading to a 23 %\nimprovement in the constraints on the AP parameters compared to previous\nmethods where the analysis is performed in redshift space and, consequently, to\na better estimate of the derived cosmological parameters.

By modeling stochastic PMFs with\namplitude $B_0$ and spectral index $n_{\\rm B}$, we show that axion-like\nparticles with mass $\\sim 10^{-14}$-$10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and nanogauss-level\nnearly scale invariant PMFs can explain both ARCADE2 and EDGES. Heating from\nPMF dissipation via ambipolar diffusion and turbulent decay reduces the 21-cm\ntrough, shifting the viable parameter space. Our results stem from a consistent\ntheoretical framework developed from first principles and a combined analysis\nof the radio excess and global 21-cm signal, while remaining consistent with\nCMB bounds on PMFs and $\\Delta N_{\\rm eff}$. We conclude that global 21-cm\nobservations may offer potential sensitivity to axions, primordial magnetism,\nand dark-sector physics."}

Any of the proposed explanations, from accreting super-massive\nblack holes ensconced in ultra-dense gas to extremely compact star-systems, has\nsignificant implications for the earliest phases of galaxy evolution. Part of\nthe difficulty in concretely identifying the physical mechanisms that drive\ntheir rest ultra-violet/optical spectral properties is the lack of bona fide\nsignatures -- either star-formation or accreting super-massive black hole, that\nuniquely discriminate between competing interpretations. In this work, we\nreport the discovery of several spectral features that strongly favor the\nexistence of an accreting super-massive black hole in an LRD witnessed in the\nfirst 800 Myr of cosmic time, including several rare iron transitions and a\npossible [FeVII].

It has been shown later that a\nlarger $\\tau_{\\rm reio}$ could also relieve other anomalies including: the\ntension between BAO and CMB data, the neutrino mass tension, and the latest\nDESI plus supernovae data's tension with the standard cosmological constant\nscenario. In this paper, we systematically analyze the correlations between\n$\\tau_{\\rm reio}$ and relevant cosmological parameters in the existing cosmic\nobservation anomalies. In addition to Pearson correlation coefficients\nextracted directly from the covariance matrix, we also study partial\ncorrelation coefficients which measure intrinsic relationships between pairs of\nparameters removing the influence of other parameters. We show that $\\tau_{\\rm\nreio}$ has weak intrinsic correlations with the parameters responsible for the\ntensions and anomalies discussed. The large direct Pearson correlations that\nallow larger $\\tau_{\\rm reio}$ inferences to alleviate the cosmological\ntensions each arise from complicated networks through multiple parameters. As a\nresult, the relationships between $\\tau_{\\rm reio}$ and each anomaly are not\nindependent of each other. We also employ our method of computing correlations\nto clarify the impact of large scale polarization data, and comment also on the\neffects of CMB observations from ACT and SPT."}

When contrasting the host stellar masses ($M_*$), specific star\nformation rates (sSFR), and host dust extinction ($A_V$) between\nspectroscopically and photometrically-classified SNe Ia, Ib/c, II, and IIn, we\ndetermine that deviations in these distributions are primarily due to\nmisclassified events contaminating the photometrically-classified sample. We\nfurther show that the higher redshifts of the photometrically-classified sample\nalso force their $M_*$ and sSFR distributions to deviate from those of the\nspectroscopically-classified sample, as these properties are\nredshift-dependent. We compare host properties between\nspectroscopically-classified SN populations and determine if they primarily\ntrace $M_*$ or SFR. We find that all SN populations seem to both depend on\n$M_*$ and SFR, with SNe II and IIn somewhat more SFR-dependent than SNe Ia and\nIb/c, and SNe Ia more $M_*$-dependent than all other classes. We find the\ndifference in the SNe Ib/c and II hosts the most intriguing and speculate that\nSNe Ib/c must be more dependent on higher $M_*$ and more evolved environments\nfor the right conditions for progenitor formation.

Among these events, AT2020mot has so far exhibited the highest recorded\noptical polarisation, with tidal shocks proposed as the primary source of its\npolarised emission. We present a comprehensive analysis of 13 TDEs with\navailable polarimetric observations, aiming to determine whether the unusually\nhigh polarisation of AT2020mot stems from unique physical processes or arises\nfrom mechanisms shared by other TDEs. We present new optical polarisation\nmeasurements of TDEs obtained from multiple ground-based telescopes, combining\nthem with optical, UV, and X-ray light curves from the Zwicky Transient\nFacility and the Swift observatory, respectively. We derive intrinsic TDE\nproperties, such as SMBH and stellar masses, using MOSFiT and TDEMass, and\ncompare them with the ones of the sample population. Our population study\nreveals that AT2020mot agrees with the broader TDE sample in most physical\nproperties, including blackbody temperature, luminosity, and rise timescales.\nHowever, its optical polarisation degree is exceptionally high compared to the\nlow or undetected polarisation observed in other events. Additionally,\nAT2020mot appears to have an elevated column density from our MOSFiT fits,\nsuggesting a more complex environment than is typically assumed. We conclude\nthat although AT2020mot fits well within the general TDE population in terms of\nglobal characteristics, its extraordinarily high polarisation and higher column\ndensity challenge current models based purely on shock or reprocessing\nmechanisms. More extensive, time-resolved polarimetric monitoring of newly\ndiscovered TDEs will be critical to determine whether AT2020mot represents an\noutlier or the extreme end of a continuum of TDE properties."}

This set-up postulates a five-dimensional ghost-free massive\ngraviton with a brane-localized four-dimensional massive gravity potential, and\nhas the virtue of raising the strong-coupling scale of the 4D theory. We\nidentify two classes of models that lead to decoupled equations for the scale\nfactor on the brane: one characterized by a particular choice of boundary\nconditions for the St\\\"uckelberg fields and one characterized by a special\ntuning between the coefficients of the 5D and 4D potentials.

The superMIGHTEE project\ncombines data from the MIGHTEE project, using the precursor Square Kilometre\nArray (SKA) MeerKAT telescope in South Africa, with observations from the\nupgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in India to produce deep\nimages at several $\\mu$Jy sensitivity over a frequency range of 200 MHz--2.5\nGHz, with an angular resolution of a few arcseconds. This paper describes the\ninitial superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release, comprising total intensity continuum\nimages covering a total of 9.9 deg$^2$ at 650 MHz and 6.9 deg$^2$ at 400 MHz in\nthe XMM-LSS, COSMOS, and E-CDFS deep fields. The associated radio source\ncatalogs include 27,101 sources at 650 MHz and 10,946 sources at 400 MHz. The\nredshift distribution of the sources extends to $z\\sim4$ with a median value of\n$z=1$. An overview of the broadband spectra of the sources, in combination with\nthe MeerKAT MIGHTEE 1280 MHz data, reveals a clear change in spectral\nproperties at the transition from an active galactic nuclei-dominated\npopulation to a population dominated by star-forming galaxies at flux densities\nof a few mJy. At higher frequencies, the star-forming galaxy population\nexhibits an optically thin synchrotron spectral index indicative of energy\ninjection from supernovae. At lower frequencies, the spectra flatten\nsignificantly with decreasing flux density, and the fraction of sources with\npeaked spectra increases. This is the first superMIGHTEE uGMRT data release.\nSubsequent releases will include spectropolarimetric and spectral line image\ncubes, as well as images at lower frequencies. The goal of the superMIGHTEE\nultra-wideband dataset is to enhance our understanding of the evolution of\nactive galactic nuclei and star-forming galaxies over cosmic time, (abridged)."}

The microlensing-induced light curves of the quasar images\nare chromatic, i.e. they depend on the applied filter band. Comparison with\nmicrolensing simulations allows us to infer properties of the accretion disk.\nWe determine the R and V band light curves of the four images of HE0435-1223\nfrom 79 and 80 epochs respectively, taken from 2014 to 2024 at the Las Cumbres\nObservatory using difference imaging analysis. We consider difference light\ncurves to remove the intrinsic quasar variability. This reveals a prominent\nlong-term chromatic microlensing event in image B. We use microlensing light\ncurve simulations with both Gaussian and standard thin accretion disk\nbrightness profiles to analyse this signal. The particularly strong signal\nobserved in image B of HE0435-1223 makes it possible to detect a size ratio of\nthe accretion disk in the R band compared to the V band of\n$1.24^{+0.08}_{-0.20}$ and $1.42^{+0.11}_{-0.22}$ for the Gaussian and the thin\ndisk model, respectively. These values are in agreement with standard thin disk\ntheory. For the absolute size we find large disk half-light radii of around 0.7\nto 1.0 Einstein radii with an uncertainty of about 0.6 dex (depending on the\nfilter bands and the models). Finally, our calculations show that image B\nundergoes caustic crossings about once per year."}

Furthermore, these\nobservations provide a powerful tool to set strong constraints into very-heavy\ndark matter particles, with masses in the TeV-PeV range. In this paper, we\nexplore the potential of the newest observations of diffuse emissions at the\nGalactic plane from HAWC and LHAASO to probe this kind of dark matter over a\nwide mass range. Here, we model secondary emissions (inverse-Compton) from the\nelectrons and positrons produced in the annihilation/decay of dark matter, on\ntop of their prompt $\\gamma$-ray emission, including the effects of absorption\nof high-energy photons via pair production. Furthermore, we show that including\nthe astrophysical backgrounds (namely diffuse emission from cosmic-ray\ncollisions or emission from unresolved sources) can significantly improve these\nlimits. We find that the new measurements provided, specially by LHAASO with\nthe combination of the WCDA and KM2A detectors, allow us to set strong\nconstraints in decaying dark matter, being competitive and even improving the\nstrongest constraints at the moment. We also highlight that these regions lead\nto constraints that are less affected by uncertainties from the dark matter\ndistribution and discuss how CTA north and SWGO will be able to improve limits\nin this mass range."}

In anticipation of VLT-MOONRISE, the first\nwide-field spectroscopic galaxy survey to target cosmic noon, this work\nprovides clear predictions to compare to the future observations. We\ninvestigate the quenching of centrals, high-mass satellites, and low-mass\nsatellites from two cosmological hydrodynamical simulations: IllustrisTNG and\nEAGLE. Satellites are split according to bespoke mass thresholds, designed to\nseparate environmental and intrinsic quenching mechanisms. To determine the\nbest parameter for predicting quiescence, we apply a Random Forest\nclassification analysis for each galaxy class at each epoch. The Random Forest\nclassification determines supermassive black hole mass as the best predictor of\nquiescence in centrals and high-mass satellites. Alternatively, the quenching\nof low-mass satellites is best predicted by group halo mass, at all epochs.\nAdditionally, we investigate the evolution in the dependence of the quenched\nfraction with various parameters, revealing a more complex picture. There is\nstrong evidence for the rejuvenation of star formation from z = 2 to z = 0 in\nEAGLE, but not in IllustrisTNG. The starkest discrepancy between simulations\nrests in the mass threshold analysis. While IllustrisTNG predicts the existence\nof environmentally quenched satellites visible within the survey limits of\nMOONRISE, EAGLE does not. Hence, MOONRISE will provide critical data that is\nneeded to evaluate current models, and constrain future models, of quenching\nprocesses."}
