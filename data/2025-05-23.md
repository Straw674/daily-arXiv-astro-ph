### [1] [The Lyman-alpha Halos of Galaxies at z=2-3 in the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15881)

**TL;DR**: This study analyzes the large-scale spatial Lya profiles of galaxies from the KBSS survey at 2<z<3, revealing extended Lya emission across all subsamples, including those with central Lya absorption, and finds minimal dependence of Lya halo scale length on central galaxy properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The research focuses on understanding the spatial morphology of Lya emission in galaxies at redshifts 2<z<3, addressing gaps in knowledge about how Lya emission profiles vary with UV continuum luminosities and Lya equivalent widths, including systems with net Lya absorption.

Data: The study uses data from the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS), including 734 Lya-selected galaxies and 119 continuum-selected galaxies with Lya narrow-band imaging.

Method: Two techniques are employed: direct fitting of an exponential function to stacked profiles and a multi-component forward-modeling technique using the empirical large-scale PSF.

Result: The results show extended Lya emission in all subsamples, even those with central Lya absorption, and indicate that the scale length of the Lya halo is not strongly dependent on central galaxy properties, though a weak tendency for continuum-faint, high-EW_Lya galaxies to have larger Lya halos is noted.

Abstract: We present the large-scale spatial Lya profiles of galaxies from the Keck
Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS) at 2<z<3. This work also describes the Lya
imaging for the KBSS-Lya survey for the first time. Our sample includes 734
Lya-selected galaxies and 119 continuum-selected galaxies with Lya narrow-band
imaging, and we measure the spatial morphology of Lya and continuum emission
for stacked subsamples of these two populations. These samples allow us to
study the variation in Lya emission profiles over a broad range of UV continuum
luminosities and Lya equivalent widths (EW_Lya), including systems with net Lya
absorption in slit spectroscopy. We characterize the spatial profiles using two
techniques: directly fitting an exponential function to the stacked profile,
and a multi-component forward-modeling technique using the empirical
large-scale PSF. We find that both methods yield similar results and that the
forward-modeling technique self-consistently fits profiles exhibiting central
Lya emission or Lya absorption, with the spatial scale of central Lya
approximately matching that of the continuum emission. We also find extended
Lya emission such that all our subsamples -- including central Lya absorbers --
are net Lya emitters on scales comparable to the circumgalactic medium (R > 50
kpc, theta > 6''). We find that the scale length of the Lya halo is not
strongly dependent on the properties of the central galaxy, including its net
continuum luminosity or EW_Lya, although we find a possible weak tendency of
continuum-faint, high-EW_Lya galaxies to exhibit larger Lya halos in contrast
with previous work.

### [2] [GAMA 526784: the progenitor of a globular cluster-rich ultra-diffuse galaxy? I. Star clusters, stellar body and ionised gas properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15910)
*Maria Luisa Buzzo,Michael Hilker,Anita Zanella,Katja Fahrion,Richard M. McDermid,Remco van der Burg,Marco Mirabile*

**TL;DR**: 本研究通过分析孤立超弥散星系GAMA526784的恒星种群、星团、电离气体和运动学，揭示了其年轻星团的形成可能与局部相互作用有关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 超弥散星系（UDGs）因其多样的球状星团（GCs）分布而备受关注，但关于矮星系中星团形成的条件仍存在疑问。GAMA526784是一个孤立的UDG，具有古老的恒星体和延展的恒星形成前沿，为探索UDG演化与星团形成之间的联系提供了独特案例。

Data: 使用了HST和Subaru/HSC的成像数据，以及MUSE光谱数据。

Method: 结合SED拟合和全光谱拟合方法，分析了星系的形态、化学成分和运动学。

Result: GAMA526784的中心恒星体显示出低金属丰度和古老年龄，外围区域则更年轻但金属丰度更低。电离气体表现出更高的弥散度和局部恒星形成，暗示了可能的近期相互作用。年轻星团的年龄为8-11 Myr，质量约为log(M*/Mo)~5.0，而古老球状星团的年龄约为9 Gyr，质量约为log(M*/Mo)~5.5。

Abstract: Context. Ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) are an intriguing population of
galaxies. Despite their dwarf-like stellar masses and low surface brightness,
they have large half-light radii and exhibit a diverse range of globular
cluster (GC) populations. Some UDGs host many GCs while others have none,
raising questions about the conditions under which star clusters (SC) form in
dwarfs. GAMA526784, an isolated UDG with both an old stellar body and an
extended star-forming (SF) front, including many young SCs, provides an
exceptional case to explore the link between UDG evolution and star cluster
formation. Aims. This study investigates the stellar populations, SCs, ionised
gas, and kinematics of GAMA526784, focusing on its potential to form massive
GCs and its connection to broader UDG formation scenarios. Methods. Imaging
from HST and Subaru/HSC, alongside MUSE spectroscopy, were used to analyse the
galaxy's morphology, chemical composition, and kinematics. A combination of SED
fitting and full spectral fitting was applied. Results. GAMA526784's central
stellar body exhibits a low-metallicity ([M/H] ~ -1.0 dex) and an old age (~9.9
Gyr). The outskirts are much younger (~0.9 Gyr), but slightly more metal-poor
([M/H] ~ -1.2 dex). The stellar kinematics show low velocity dispersions (~10
km/s) and a coherent rotational field, while the ionised gas exhibits higher
dispersions (~50 km/s), a misaligned rotation axis (~20 deg) and localised SF,
what could be suggestive of a recent interaction. The young SCs span ages of
8-11 Myr and masses of log(M*/Mo)~5.0, while the old GCs have ~9 Gyr and
stellar masses of log(M*/Mo)~5.5. Conclusions. GAMA526784's properties point to
interactions that triggered localised SF, leading to the formation of young
SCs. Future observations of its molecular and neutral gas will help assess its
environment, and the trigger of this SF episode.

**TL;DR**: 研究人员通过光学、红外和射电巡天数据，结合文献中的候选类星体目录，发现了多个高红移类星体，并对其性质进行了详细分析，包括射电发射、黑洞质量和极端外流特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 高红移（z>4）的明亮类星体对研究早期宇宙至关重要，但由于其稀少性，需要通过多波段巡天数据与天体物理污染物（如超冷矮星）进行区分。

Data: 研究使用了光学、红外和射电巡天数据，以及文献中的类星体候选目录。

Method: 通过目标选择方法，结合光学、红外和射电数据，筛选高红移类星体，并利用光谱分析其性质。

Result: 发现了多个红移在4.6到6.9之间的类星体，其中六个红移超过6.5；部分类星体表现出强射电发射、极端外流特征，并估算了黑洞质量和爱丁顿比率。

Abstract: Luminous quasars at $z>4$ provide key insights into the early Universe. Their
rarity necessitates wide-field multi-band surveys to efficiently separate them
from the main astrophysical contaminants (i.e., ultracool dwarfs). To expand
the sample of high-$z$ quasars, we conducted targeted selections using optical,
infrared, and radio surveys, complemented by literature-based quasar candidate
catalogs. In this paper, we report the discovery of \nqsos\ new quasars at
$4.6<z<6.9$ (six at $z\geq6.5$), with $M_{1450}$ between $-$25.4 and $-$27.0.
We also present new spectra of six $z>6.5$ quasars we selected, but whose
independent discovery has already been published in the literature. Three of
the newly discovered quasars are strong radio emitters (L$_{1.4~\rm
GHz}$$=0.09-1.0\times$10$^{34}$erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$). Among them, one source
at $z=4.71$ exhibits typical blazar-like properties, including a flat radio
spectrum, radio-loudness $\sim$1000, and multi-frequency variability. It is
also detected by SRG/eROSITA X-ray telescope (f$_{\rm 0.2-2.3keV} \sim
1.3\times10^{-13}$erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$). In addition, for seven $6.3<z<6.9$
quasars we present near-infrared spectroscopy and estimate the central black
hole mass from their C$\rm IV$ and Mg$\rm II$ broad emission lines.Their masses
(log[M$_{\rm BH,MgII}$]$=8.58-9.14~\rm M_{\odot}$) and Eddington ratios
($\lambda_{\rm Edd,MgII}=0.74-2.2$) are consistent with other $z>6$ quasars
reported in the literature. A $z = 6.3$ quasar exhibits a velocity difference
of approximately $9000$ km s$^{-1}$ between the C$\rm IV$ and Mg$\rm II$
emission lines, making it one of the most extreme C$\rm IV$ outflows currently
known. Additionally, the sample includes three high-ionization broad absorption
line quasars. One of these quasars shows potential evidence of an extremely
fast outflow feature, reaching $48000$ km s$^{-1}$.

### [4] [Chemical Abundances in the Milky Way's Nuclear Stellar Disc](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15924)
*N. Ryde,G. Nandakumar,R. Albarracin,M. Schultheis,A. Rojas-Arriagada,M. Zoccali*

**TL;DR**: 本研究通过分析银河中心核恒星盘（NSD）中9颗M巨星的18种元素丰度趋势，揭示了NSD与核星团（NSC）及内凸起结构的化学相似性，表明它们可能具有共同的演化历史。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 银河中心核恒星盘（NSD）是一个旋转的盘状结构，被认为具有独特的恒星形成历史，但其形成过程及与其他银河中心结构的演化关系尚不明确。

Data: 研究使用了9颗金属丰度范围在-1.0 <[Fe/H]< 0.5的M巨星的高分辨率H和K波段光谱数据，这些数据通过安装在Gemini South望远镜上的IGRINS光谱仪获取。

Method: 通过将NSD恒星的丰度趋势与其他银河结构（如内凸起和核星团）的恒星丰度趋势进行一致性分析，以减少系统不确定性。

Result: 研究发现NSD恒星的丰度趋势在大多数元素上与内凸起和核星团相似，尤其是在超太阳金属丰度下；钠元素表现出独特的增强趋势。化学相似性表明NSD可能与核星团及内盘序列具有共同的演化历史，但未发现与典型球状星团丰度特征的关联。

Abstract: The Nuclear Stellar Disc (NSD) is a rotating, disc-like structure in the
Galactic Center, believed to have a distinct star formation. However, its
formation history and evolutionary links to other structures in the Galactic
Center remain uncertain. This study aims to present the first comprehensive
chemical census of the NSD by deriving abundance trends for 18 elements in 9 M
giants in the metallicity range of -1.0 <[Fe/H]< 0.5. By comparing these trends
with those of other Galactic populations we seek to understand the chemical
relationships between these structures. We obtained high-resolution H- and
K-band spectra of NSD stars using the IGRINS spectrometer mounted on the Gemini
South telescope. The giants were analyzed consistently with stars from a
comparison populations to minimize systematic uncertainties. The abundance
trends of NSD stars exhibit similarities with those of the inner-bulge and
Nuclear Star Cluster (NSC) populations across a broad range of elements with
different chemical evolution histories. The trends for 17 elements align
closely with the local thick-disc behaviour at subsolar metallicities. At
super-solar metallicities, most elements follow the NSC and inner-bulge trends.
Sodium is the only element exhibiting a distinct trend, with enhanced
abundances in the NSD and NSC compared to both thin-disc and inner-bulge stars.
The chemical similarity suggests that the NSD likely shares an evolutionary
history with the NSC and possibly the inner-disc sequence. Further studies are
required to determine potential evolutionary links to Liller 1 and metal-rich
globular clusters. We find no evidence of typical globular cluster abundance
signatures in our NSD stars with subsolar metallicities. Our study demonstrates
the feasibility of obtaining high-quality abundance data even in highly
dust-obscured regions of the Milky Way, paving the way for future surveys.

### [5] [MeerKAT Discovery of an Infalling Cold Gas Tail onto the Nearby Barred Spiral Galaxy, NGC 5643](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15983)
*K. C. Santana,F. M. Maccagni,R. Deane,J. Healy*

**TL;DR**: 通过MeerKAT的21厘米观测，揭示了NGC 5643周围的中性氢分布及其动力学特征，填补了冷气体流动研究的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 对本地活动星系核（AGN）中气体流动的详细研究对于理解恒星形成和黑洞增长的调控至关重要，这些是星系演化的基础。NGC 5643是一个典型的案例，其流入和流出已被详细观测，但缺乏高分辨率的中性氢观测数据。

Data: 使用了MeerKAT的21厘米观测数据。

Method: 通过MeerKAT进行高分辨率中性氢观测。

Result: 观测揭示了NGC 5643周围的六个低质量中性氢源、一个30千秒尺度的反向旋转尾流、星系盘外的中性氢扩展、以及核区的中性氢吸收和发射特征，为冷气体流动提供了完整信息。

Abstract: The detailed study of gas flows in local Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is
essential for understanding the regulation of star formation and black hole
growth, which are fundamental to galaxy evolution. One such AGN case study is
NGC 5643, a nearby ($D_{L}\sim17.3$ Mpc) star-forming, late-type, Seyfert
galaxy, where inflows and outflows have been observed in detail. NGC 5643 has
been studied at multiple wavelengths, however, a key missing component is
sensitive, high-resolution neutral hydrogen ($\mathrm{H\,I}$) observations. We
present 21-cm observations of NGC 5643 with MeerKAT, revealing six
low-$\mathrm{H\,I}$ mass ($M_{\text{$\mathrm{H\,I}$}}\sim10^{7} M_\odot$)
sources surrounding NGC 5643 and $\mathrm{H\,I}$ in IC 4444, $\sim230$ kpc
north of NGC 5643. In NGC 5643, $\mathrm{H\,I}$ extends beyond the stellar disk
with several morphological and kinematical asymmetries. North of the disk is an
extended 30 kpc tail with counter-rotating velocities. This is $\mathrm{H\,I}$
gas accreting onto the regularly rotating disk of NGC 5643 from the
environment. Within the spiral arms of the disk, we identify extraplanar gas
components, tracing galactic fountains driven by star formation regions. These
fountains have a molecular gas component and show an increased
$\mathrm{H}_2$/$\mathrm{H\,I}$ ratio. In the circum-nuclear region, we observe
spatially unresolved $\mathrm{H\,I}$ absorption that is slightly blue-shifted
($\sim72$ \kms) with an $\mathrm{H\,I}$ emission counterpart at redshifted
velocities. These MeerKAT observations provide a complete census of the
$\mathrm{H\,I}$ in and around this nearby Seyfert galaxy, providing missing
information on the cold gas flows fuelling the star formation and nuclear
activity.

*Yu-Ting Wang,Chao Liu,Zhi-Yu Zhang*

**TL;DR**: 通过K巨星和O/B型恒星的光谱数据，确定了高速云Anti-Center Shell (ACS)的距离下限为约8 kpc，并发现了一个具有异常高速度的棒状结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 高速云（HVCs）是速度与银河系旋转不符的星际气体云，自1963年首次发现以来，其起源因缺乏关键参数（如距离）而一直存在争议。

Data: 使用了K巨星的消光数据和O/B型恒星光谱中的5780埃漫射星际带（DIB）特征。

Method: 通过K巨星的已知距离和O/B型恒星光谱中的DIB特征拟合，确定了ACS的距离。

Result: 提供了ACS的距离下限为约8 kpc，比之前的研究扩展了约4 kpc，并发现了一个具有异常高速度的棒状结构。

Abstract: High-velocity clouds (HVCs) are interstellar gas clouds whose velocities are
incompatible with Galactic rotation. Since the first discovery of HVCs in 1963,
their origins have been debated for decades but are still not settled down,
because of the lack of vital parameters of HVCs, e.g., the distance. In this
work, we determined the distance to the high-velocity cloud, namely the
Anti-Center Shell (ACS). We trace the ACS with extinction derived from K-giant
stars with known distances and with the diffuse interstellar band (DIB) feature
at 5780 $\text{{\AA}}$ fitted on spectra of O- and B-type stars with distance.
As a result, we provide a lower limit distance of ACS as $\sim$8 kpc, which
extends the lower limit outward by approximately 4 kpc compared to previous
work. A byproduct of the DIB method is that we detected a bar-shaped structure
with a unusually high positive line-of-sight velocity. Its shape extends along
the (l,b)=(155,-5)$^{\circ}$ sight-line and shows a slightly increasing trend
in equivalent width and velocity as the distance increases.

### [7] [The Peekaboo galaxy: new SALT spectroscopy and implications of archive HST data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16006)
*Alexei Kniazev,Simon Pustilnik*

**TL;DR**: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Error

Data: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Abstract: The dwarf galaxy Peekaboo was recently identified as a Local Volume (LV)
gas-rich and 'eXtremely Metal-Poor' (XMP) dIrr. Its gas metallicity is
Z~Zsun/50, with +/-1$\sigma$ uncertainty range of [Zsun/72-Zsun/35]). Its the
"Tip of Red Giant Stars" (TRGB)-based distance is of 6.8$\pm$0.7 Mpc. HST data
for its individual stars reveal that its older RGB stars comprise a smaller
part, while the majority of visible stars have ages of less than one to a few
Gyr. Thus, Peekaboo dwarf can be considered as the nearest record-low-Z dwarf.
As such, the galaxy deserves a deeper multi-method study, including properties
of both, young massive stars and the fainter older population, and its ionised
gas and the dominant baryonic component of HI gas. We use the direct (Te)
method for the east HII region, in which the [OIII]4363A line is well detected,
to estimate its parameter 12+log(O/H). Since in the west HII region the line
[OIII]4363A is not detected, its O/H is estimated via the empirical
"strong-line" method. The resulting value of O/H is very close to that in the
east HII region. The new spectroscopy of Peekaboo dwarf allows us to improve
substantially the accuracy of its direct O/H estimate, which appears of
12+log(O/H) = 6.99$\pm$0.06. The new data reveal that emission lines in the E
region consist of two components with the velocity difference of ~65 km/s. The
fainter, approaching, component can be related to a fast-moving WR star thrown
from a cluster or a binary system. Using the HST $V$ magnitudes and colour
$V-I$, we identify tentative O-type and very hot candidate WO stars, which are
likely the ionising stars of the studied HII regions. With the new optical
spectra, the Peekaboo galaxy is confirmed as the lowest-metallicity dwarf in
the Local Volume and the valuable object for indeep multi-method studies.

**TL;DR**: 通过光谱观测NGC 1023中的球状星团和模糊星团候选体，研究发现模糊星团比球状星团更年轻且金属丰度相似，支持其起源于星系盘中的超星团。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究背景包括对NGC 1023中的球状星团和模糊星团候选体的光谱观测，旨在确定其性质、年龄和金属丰度，并探讨其起源。

Data: 使用10.4米Gran Telescopio Canarias望远镜对26个球状星团候选体和21个模糊星团候选体进行光谱观测。

Method: 通过光谱数据测量退行速度和恒星吸收特征，确定候选体的性质，并分析其速度、年龄、金属丰度和消光。

Result: 研究发现18个球状星团和9个模糊星团为真实成员，模糊星团年龄（7-9 Gyr）明显小于球状星团（>10 Gyr），两者金属丰度相似（[Fe/H] = -0.58 ± 0.33），模糊星团可能起源于星系盘中的超星团。

Abstract: We here report the results from spectroscopic observations of a sample of 26
globular cluster (GC) and 21 faint fuzzy (FF) candidates in the lenticular
galaxy NGC 1023 using the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. Using the
recessional velocities and stellar absorption features, we determine that 18
and 9 of the observed candidates are bona fide GCs and FFs, respectively. The
majority of the rejected FF candidates are background emission line galaxies
for which we determine their redshifts. We used the spectroscopic data to
determine velocity, age, metallicity and extinction of all bona fide clusters.
We find that FFs are clearly younger (age = 7-9 Gyr) than GCs (age > 10 Gyr).
Both kind of clusters in this galaxy are metal-rich ([Fe/H] = -0.58 $\pm$
0.33). The ages and metallicities of individual FFs reported here are the first
such measurements in any galaxy and agree with the previously-reported
measurement on stacked spectrum. The kinematical analysis reaffirms that the
FFs belong to the disk of the galaxy, suggesting that their progenitors are
most likely massive, compact disk clusters that have been able to survive for
long timescales. We propose that the fuzzy appearance of FFs as compared to the
GCs is a consequence of the dynamical evolution of their progenitor super star
clusters in the disks of low-mass galaxies.

Background: 强透镜系统中透镜和源的红移精确测定对于确认系统并实现其科学价值至关重要，但大规模成像巡天发现的数千个候选体使得逐一后续观测变得不切实际。

Data: 使用了Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program的强透镜候选体数据和DESI DR1的光谱数据。

Method: 通过交叉匹配强透镜候选体与DESI DR1数据，分析光谱以确定透镜和源的红移。

Result: 在约500个匹配候选体中，确定了27个系统的透镜和源红移，并发现76个候选系统的透镜星系红移大于0.8，其中一个候选系统的透镜星系内包含一个类星体。

Abstract: Accurate redshift determinations of both lenses and sources are critical for
confirming strong-lens systems and fully realizing their scientific value.
However, the thousands of strong-lens candidates now routinely discovered in
wide-field imaging surveys make one-by-one follow-up observations impractical.
In this work, we investigate the capability and efficiency of large-scale
spectroscopic surveys in confirming strong-lens systems. As a case study, we
cross-match strong lens candidates identified from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru
Strategic Program with Data Release 1 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic
Instrument (DESI). We find that DESI DR1 serendipitously observed putative
lenses and/or lensed images in approximately 50\% of these candidates.
Analyzing the DESI spectra for $\approx 500$ matched candidates that meet our
specific interests, we determine both lens and source redshifts for 27 systems.
Additionally, 76 candidate systems feature lensing galaxies at $z > 0.8$, and
one candidate system contains a quasar within its lensing galaxy. Applying this
approach to other strong-lens candidates will yield numerous additional
confirmations, with a further several-fold increase anticipated from the final
DESI data release. Our results highlight the growing importance of large-scale
spectroscopic surveys in advancing strong lensing discoveries and
investigations.

**TL;DR**: 研究通过高分辨率成像和辐射传输模型揭示了NGC 253星系中甲醛和甲醇的物理和化学环境差异，挑战了它们之间的直接化学联系假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 甲醛（H2CO）和甲醇（CH3OH）长期以来被视为恒星形成过程的传统示踪物，但研究表明它们所处的物理环境存在显著差异。

Data: 使用了ALCHEMI大型项目提供的NGC 253中央分子区（CMZ）的高空间分辨率（1.6角秒或约28 pc）和高光谱分辨率（约10 km/s）成像数据。

Method: 通过辐射传输模型对八个巨型分子云（GMCs）的密集气体体积密度、温度、分子柱密度和源填充因子进行了约束，并测量了CH3OH两种核自旋异构体的相对丰度。

Result: 研究发现H2CO和CH3OH分别来自不同的物理环境：H2CO示踪低体积密度和高动能温度，而CH3OH示踪高体积密度和低动能温度。甲醇的形成受温暖动态过程影响，而甲醛主要通过气相反应形成，挑战了它们之间的直接化学联系假设。

Abstract: Formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and methanol (CH$_3$OH) have served as traditional
tracers of the star formation process for decades. Studies of the environments
which produce these species, though, have pointed to significant differences in
the physical environments within which each molecule resides. In this paper we
investigate the physical and chemical conditions which give rise to
formaldehyde and methanol emission in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253. We
employ high spatial (1.$''$6 or $\sim28$ pc) and spectral ($\sim10$ km/s)
imaging of the NGC 253 central molecular zone (CMZ) from the ALCHEMI Large
Program to constrain radiative transfer models of the dense gas volume density,
and temperature, molecular species column density, and source filling factor
within eight giant molecular clouds (GMCs). We also measure the relative
abundances of the two nuclear spin isomers of CH$_3$OH to investigate its
formation history. The physical and chemical conditions derived clearly
indicate that H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH originate from distinct physical
environments. H$_2$CO traces low volume density and high kinetic temperatures,
while CH$_3$OH traces high volume density and low kinetic temperatures. The
H$_2$CO abundances are constant, though poorly constrained, within the eight
NGC 253 GMCs analyzed, while the CH$_3$OH abundance shows a radial gradient
from low to high values within the NGC 253 CMZ. Our findings highlight the
complex chemical and physical differentiation of CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO in the
starburst environment of NGC 253. Methanol formation appears to be influenced
by warm, dynamic processes rather than cold cloud chemistry, while formaldehyde
primarily forms via gas-phase reactions. These results challenge the assumption
of a direct chemical link between CH$_3$OH and H$_2$CO and underscores the
impact of starburst-driven shocks, turbulence, and cosmic rays on molecular gas
chemistry.

Background: 矮星系中的活动星系核（AGN）识别对于理解黑洞形成至关重要，但由于其低光度、低金属丰度以及恒星形成驱动的发射掩盖AGN特征，这一任务极具挑战性。机器学习技术，特别是无监督方法，为通过复杂数据模式识别解决这些问题提供了新途径。

Data: 研究使用了来自NSA目录的30,344个矮星系（红移小于0.055，恒星质量低于10的9.5次方太阳质量）的九波段（从近紫外到中红外）测光数据，以及438个通过不同方法先前识别的矮星系AGN样本。

Method: 研究采用自组织映射（SOM）技术，训练了一个51x51的SOM模型，用于探索矮星系的SED流形并评估不同诊断方法对AGN选择的影响。

Result: 研究发现，不同方法选择的AGN在SED空间中占据不同且部分重叠的区域，反映了与宿主星系性质相关的选择偏差。例如，BPT方法选择的AGN集中在高质量区域，而X射线和变率选择的AGN分布更广。WISE方法选择的AGN集中在低质量区域，并分为两类：一类与蓝色、类似星暴的系统相关，另一类与红色、更类似AGN的SED相关。此外，传统发射线、宽线和WISE方法选择的AGN倾向于避开与强恒星形成相关的SOM区域，而低质量星系中的部分AGN则表现出高AGN光度相对于恒星含量的特征。

Abstract: Identifying AGNs in dwarf galaxies is critical for understanding black hole
formation but remains challenging due to their low luminosities, low
metallicities, and star formation-driven emission that can obscure AGN
signatures. Machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly unsupervised
methods, offer new ways to address these challenges by uncovering patterns in
complex data. In this study, we apply Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to explore
the SED manifold of dwarf galaxies and evaluate AGN selection biases across
diagnostics. We train a 51 by 51 SOM on 30,344 dwarf galaxies (redshift less
than 0.055 and stellar mass below 10 to the 9.5 solar masses) from the NSA
catalog using nine-band photometry from near-UV to mid-infrared. A set of 438
previously identified dwarf AGNs, selected via various methods, was mapped onto
the SOM. AGNs identified by different methods occupy distinct and partially
overlapping regions in SED space, reflecting selection biases tied to host
properties. BPT selected AGNs cluster in higher-mass regions, while X-ray and
variability-selected AGNs show broader distributions. WISE-selected AGNs are
concentrated in lower-mass regions and form two clumps: one associated with
bluer, starburst-like systems and the other with redder, more AGN-like SEDs.
This separation may help distinguish true AGN hosts from starburst contaminants
in WISE-selected samples. AGNs selected via traditional emission-line,
broad-line, and WISE methods tend to avoid SOM regions linked to strong star
formation. In contrast, a subset of AGNs in low-mass galaxies occupy regions
indicative of high AGN luminosity relative to stellar content, highlighting
luminous AGNs in faint hosts. These results demonstrate the utility of manifold
learning for improving AGN selection in the low-mass regime.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究探讨了棒状结构形成对银河系类似星系中恒星形成率、恒星迁移及盘星年龄和金属丰度分布的影响，填补了现有研究中对这一短暂阶段动态变化的不足。

Data: 使用化学动力学N体/流体动力学模拟数据。

Method: 采用化学动力学N体/流体动力学模拟方法。

Result: 研究发现棒状结构形成期间内盘恒星形成率显著增加，外盘恒星形成持续但水平较低，且恒星迁移导致外盘恒星年龄分布出现峰值，金属丰度较高。

Abstract: We present a chemo-dynamical $N$-body/hydrodynamic simulation of an isolated
Milky Way-like galaxy to investigate how bar formation influences star
formation rates, stellar migration, and the resulting age and metallicity
distributions of disk stars. Focusing on the transient epoch of bar formation,
a phase that triggers gas inflows, enhances local star formation, and drives
significant orbital migration, we find that the star formation rate in the
inner disk exhibits a pronounced peak during this period. This behavior arises
from the combined effect of vigorous star formation driven by strong spiral
arms prior to bar formation and the subsequent suppression of star formation
once the bar is established. In contrast, star formation in the outer disk
persists after bar formation at modest levels, and enhanced outward migration
of stars originally formed in the inner regions gives rise to a pronounced peak
in the outer disk's stellar age distribution corresponding to the bar formation
epoch. Moreover, stars formed during this epoch tend to exhibit higher
gas-phase metallicities, reflecting their origin in more metal-rich inner
regions. Although our model does not capture every detail of the Milky Way's
complex evolution, our results highlight the dominant role of bar driven
migration in segregating star formation activity and in shaping the long-term
chemical and age structure of the Galactic disk. Recent observational studies
suggest that the Milky Way's bar is approximately 8 Gyr old; therefore, our
findings imply that the age distribution of stars in the solar circle and outer
disk should show a corresponding peak around that age.

Background: Gaia数据集揭示了银河系许多精细的子结构，如移动群和相位螺旋，但需要处理其异方差噪声模型以精确表征这些特征并与理论模型比较。

Method: 提出了一种基于归一化流的机器学习方法，通过双射变换将简单基分布转化为复杂目标分布，并结合重要性采样进行降噪。

Result: 该方法成功重建了被噪声污染的局部速度分布，捕捉到了Hercules流的多分支和相空间螺旋等精细结构。

Abstract: The Gaia dataset has revealed many intricate Milky Way substructures in
exquisite detail, including moving groups and the phase spiral. Precise
characterisation of these features and detailed comparisons to theoretical
models require engaging with Gaia's heteroscedastic noise model, particularly
in more distant parts of the Galactic disc and halo. We propose a general,
novel machine-learning approach using normalizing flows for denoising density
estimation, with particular focus on density estimation from stellar survey
data such as that from Gaia. Normalizing flows transform a simple base
distribution into a complex target distribution through bijective
transformations resulting in a highly expressive and flexible model. The
denoising is performed using importance sampling. We demonstrate that this
general procedure works excellently on Gaia data by reconstructing detailed
local velocity distributions artificially corrupted with noise. For example, we
show the multiple branches of the Hercules stream and the phase-space spiral
can both be well captured by our model. We discuss hyperparameter choice to
optimally recover substructure and compare our approach to extreme
deconvolution. The model therefore promises to be a robust tool for studying
the Milky Way's kinematics in Galactic locations where the noise from Gaia is
significant.

**TL;DR**: 本研究利用S-PLUS数据开发了PELE管道，检测了Fornax星系团周围的Hα+[NII]发射体，揭示了星系在进入主团前的演化特征及其分布与团组装历史的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Fornax星系团是20 Mpc范围内第二大星系团，为研究环境对星系演化的影响提供了理想条件。现有研究在探测星系发射体和分析其形态扰动方面存在不足。

Data: 使用了Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS)的数据，覆盖了NGC 1399周围约208平方度的区域。

Method: 开发了半自动化管道PELE，采用Three Filter Method处理S-PLUS图像生成发射线图，并使用ASTROMORPHLIB包进行形态分析。

Result: 检测到77个Hα+[NII]发射体，其中25%为早型星系，75%为晚型星系；44%的晚型星系和3个早型星系显示形态扰动或合并活动；91%的发射体为近期落入星系的成员，分布反映了Fornax星团的组装历史。

Abstract: The Fornax cluster, the second-largest galaxy cluster within 20 Mpc, presents
an ideal environment for studying environmental effects on galaxy evolution.
Utilizing data from the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS),
this study explores the H$\alpha$+[NII] emission maps across an area of
approximately 208 square degrees around NGC 1399. For such, a dedicated
semi-automated pipeline, Pixel-to-Pixel Emission Line Estimate (PELE), was
developed to generate emission line maps by processing S-PLUS images using the
Three Filter Method. A morphological analysis was conducted using the
ASTROMORPHLIB package to determine whether H$\alpha$+[NII] emitters exhibit
perturbed features. The study successfully detected 77 H$\alpha$+[NII] emitters
with $r<18$ mag, extending to four times the virial radius of the Fornax
cluster. PELE demonstrated its ability to recover flux down to 2e-17 erg
s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ when compared to H$\alpha$ maps from MUSE/VLT. Among the
emitters, 25% are early-type galaxies (ETG) and 75% late-type galaxies (LTG).
Signs of morphological perturbation or merger activity are observed in 44% of
the LTG and in three ETG located beyond the cluster's virial radius. A
significant fraction (91%) of the emitters are identified as recent infallers,
primarily located in the northwestern region of the cluster, while others are
associated with the infalling group Fornax A in the southwest. Disturbed,
low-mass galaxies at larger cluster-centric distances provide evidence of
galaxies begin transforming before entering the main cluster. This study
demonstrates S-PLUS's effectiveness in detecting emitters, whose distribution
reflects the Fornax cluster's assembly history, with LTG linked to recent
infall from the field, possibly along a Fornax-Eridanus filament, and ETG may
have evolved prior to entry.

Background: 当前研究领域关注恒星形成星系中尘埃衰减曲线的特性及其与星系质量、几何结构的关系，但现有研究在系统性分析大规模样本和揭示内在机制方面存在不足。

Data: 使用了SDSS DR7中169,568个恒星形成星系的数据。

Method: 采用了非参数方法SEW（Stellar Population Synthesis with Equivalent Widths）来重建光谱分辨率波长依赖衰减曲线，并结合辐射传输模型进行分析。

Result: 研究发现，高恒星质量与更陡的衰减斜率相关，而侧向星系由于几何饱和效应表现出更平坦的曲线；此外，还初步检测到4870、6370和7690埃的中尺度结构，揭示了尘埃几何、颗粒演化与星系环境的相互作用。

Abstract: We introduce a non-parametric approach, the Stellar Population Synthesis with
Equivalent Widths (SEW) method, to reconstruct spectral-resolution
wavelength-dependent attenuation curves for 169,568 star-forming galaxies from
the SDSS DR7. Composite attenuation curves, stacked across stellar mass and
inclination bins, reveal systematic trends: higher stellar mass correlates with
steeper attenuation slopes (lower $R_V$), while edge-on galaxies exhibit
flatter curves due to geometric saturation effects. Radiative transfer
modelling under a uniform dust-star mixture confirms that the observed slope
evolution with inclination comes from the galaxy geometry; the slope evolution
with stellar mass arises from intrinsic dust property variations, linked to
mass-dependent grain processing mechanisms. Additionally, intermediate-scale
structures (ISS) at 4870, 6370, and 7690 \r{A} are tentatively detected. These
findings underscore the interplay between dust geometry, grain evolution, and
galactic environment, offering new insights into dust lifecycle models.

### [16] [The alternating 'changing-look' blazar OQ 334 (B2 1420+32): New observational clues to the blazar state transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15900)
*Krishan Chand,Gopal-Krishna*

**TL;DR**: 研究发现高光度耀变体OQ 334在光学耀发期间会从平谱射电类星体状态转变为BL Lac状态，且这种转变与γ射线谱斜率的变化相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 高光度耀变体OQ 334是一种罕见的在平谱射电类星体（FSRQ）和BL Lac（BLL）状态之间交替变化的天体，其光学连续谱爆发与状态转变相关。

Data: 使用了约5年的γ射线谱斜率（Γγ）数据以及光学耀发观测数据。

Method: 通过监测γ射线谱斜率（Γγ）作为诊断工具，分析光学耀发与状态转变的关联。

Result: 研究发现过去5年中观测到的4次状态转变（Γγ < 2.0）均伴随光学耀发，表明状态转变可能与光学连续谱增强有关，但也可能存在其他因素。

Abstract: The high-luminosity blazar OQ 334 is a leading exponent of the intriguing
rare phenomenon of alternating between a flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) and
a BL Lac (BLL) states. Its two optical continuum outbursts observed during the
$\sim$ 1.5-year long time span, starting Jan 2018, had been shown to coincide
with transition from the FSRQ to BLL state, manifested by a sharp drop in the
equivalent width of MgII broad emission-line. Recently, a continuous monitoring
of its blazar state, over a much longer duration (past $\sim$ 5 years) has
become possible by deploying the observed $\gamma-ray$ spectral slope
($\Gamma_{\gamma}$) as a diagnostic. This opens prospects of making a much less
biased and statistically more robust check on the association of optical
flaring with FSRQ $\rightarrow$ BLL transition. We find that all 4 such
transitions ($\Gamma_{\gamma}$ becoming < 2.0), observed during the past $\sim$
5 years, were accompanied by an optical flare. While this appears consistent
with the transition to BL Lac state happening purely due to an enhanced optical
continuum (flaring) swamping out the broad emission-lines, this simple scheme
may need additional ingredients, considering the hint found for a day-like
offset between the flaring and the state transition.

**TL;DR**: 通过分析LK-Hα-233的高分辨率近紫外偏振数据，揭示了Herbig Ae/Be星周围的双极外流和尘埃盘结构，强调了偏振观测在理解恒星形成环境中的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Herbig Ae/Be星是年轻的、主序前恒星，其周围的尘埃盘和双极电离外流对理解行星形成过程和星际介质中的能量/物质沉积至关重要。偏振成像因其对发射、散射和吸收介质形态的敏感性，是研究这些结构的有效工具。

Data: 使用了哈勃太空望远镜Faint Object Camera在1991、1994和1995年拍摄的LK-Hα-233的近紫外偏振数据。

Method: 利用最新的数据还原流程，获得了高空间分辨率（0.0287 x 0.0287角秒²）的偏振测量和4118埃波段的图像。

Result: 研究发现了一个暗带，将接近和远离的双极外流分开，表明存在一个遮蔽主序前恒星并准直喷出物的尘埃盘或环。偏振揭示了外流具有X形结构，偏振角呈现显著的对称模式，表明外流是中空的且散射了被遮蔽恒星的辐射。研究还约束了外流和尘埃盘的半开角，确定了系统的倾角，并估算了被遮蔽恒星的本征流量。

Abstract: Herbig Ae/Be stars are young, pre-main-sequence stars that provide critical
insights into the processes of stellar formation, early stellar evolution and
protoplanetary disks.Two of the key features of such stars are their
circumstellar dusty disk and bipolar ionized outflows, which are key components
for understanding planet formation processes and energy/matter deposition in
the interstellar medium, respectively. In this context, imaging polarimetry is
probably the sharpest tool to characterize the various structures and dynamics
around the central star, due to the sensitivity of polarization to the
morphology of the emitting, scattering and absorbing media. We take advantage
of never published, near-ultraviolet polarimetric data of LK-H{\alpha}-233
taken by the Faint Object Camera aboard the Hubble Space Telescope in 1991,
1994 and 1995, which remained dormant in the archives despite their quality.
Using the most recent and robust reduction pipeline for this instrument, we
obtained high spatial resolution (0.0287 x 0.0287 arcsecond2) maps of this
object at 4118 {\AA}, together with polarimetric measurements. A dark lane,
bisecting the approaching and receding polar outflows, suggests the presence of
a circumstellar disk or dust torus, obscuring the pre-main sequence star and
collimating the ejecta. Polarization reveals that the outflows have an X-shape
structure with a significant centro-symmetric pattern in polarization angle,
indicating that the outflows are both hollow and scattering the emission from
the buried star. We constrain the half-opening angle of both the outflows and
circumstellar disk, determine the inclination of the system and estimate the
obscured star's intrinsic flux. This study highlights the importance of
high-resolution polarimetric observations in understanding the complex
environment around Herbig Ae/Be stars and advocates for future similar
instruments.

<details>

Background: 超大质量黑洞双星（SMBHBs）的探测对于理解星系合并的作用和识别低频引力波源至关重要，但活动星系核（AGN）的随机变异性可能掩盖周期性信号，增加了探测难度。

Data: 约77万个活动星系核（AGN）的观测数据，来自Gaia空间天文台。

Method: 使用一种新型且计算高效的贝叶斯模型选择框架，用于识别周期性信号并量化其相对于随机变异性的可能性。

Result: 发现了181个新的超大质量黑洞双星候选体，几乎翻倍了已知样本，并为下一代时域巡天提供了优先目标列表。

Abstract: Robust detections of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are essential
to unravel the role of galaxy mergers in galaxy evolution and for identifying
potential sources of low-frequency gravitational waves. One of the most
commonly used observational signatures of SMBHBs is periodic variability in the
light curves of active galactic nuclei (AGN), which may arise from accretion
rate modulation or relativistic Doppler boosting due to binary orbital motion.
However, intrinsic stochastic AGN variability can mimic such periodic signals,
complicating robust identification. We report the discovery of 181 new SMBHB
candidates from a sample of approximately 770,000 AGN observed by the Gaia
space observatory. Periodic signals were identified using a novel and
computationally efficient Bayesian model selection framework, enabling unbiased
source selection and quantifying the likelihood of periodicity over stochastic
variability. These candidates nearly double the known SMBHB population and
provide a prioritized target list for next-generation time-domain surveys.

### [19] [A magnitude-limited catalogue of unresolved white dwarf-main sequence binaries from Gaia DR3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15895)
*Alberto Rebassa-Mansergas,Enrique Solano,Alex J. Brown,Steven G. Parsons,Raquel Murillo-Ojeda,Roberto Raddi,Maria Camisassa,Santiago Torres,Jan van Roestel*

**TL;DR**: A magnitude-limited sample of unresolved white dwarf-main-sequence (WDMS) binaries from Gaia DR3 is constructed, analyzed, and characterized, providing a catalog of 1312 WDMS systems with derived stellar parameters for 435 and identification of 67 eclipsing systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Binary stars containing a white dwarf and a main-sequence star (WDMS binaries) are valuable for studying various aspects of stellar astrophysics. Existing studies are limited, and this work aims to expand the sample using Gaia DR3 data.

Data: The study uses data from Gaia DR3, including photometry, astrometry, and spectra, as well as light curves from ZTF and CRTS.

Method: The authors apply quality cuts on Gaia data, fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using VOSA, visually inspect spectra and images, and analyze light curves to identify eclipsing systems.

Result: The final catalog includes 1312 WDMS binaries, with stellar parameters derived for 435 and 67 eclipsing systems identified. The sample's completeness is estimated at ~50% (~5% when considering missing Gaia spectra).

Abstract: Binary stars containing a white dwarf and a main-sequence star, WDMS
binaries, can be used to study a wide range of aspects of stellar astrophysics.
We build a magnitude-limited sample of unresolved WDMS binaries from Gaia DR3
to enlarge these studies. We look for WDMS with available spectra whose
location in the Gaia colour-magnitude diagram bridges between the evolutionary
sequences of single white dwarfs and the main-sequence. To exclude spurious
sources we apply quality cuts on the Gaia photometry and astrometry and we fit
the SED (spectral energy distribution) of the objects with VOSA (Virtual
Observatory SED Analyser) to exclude single sources. We further clean the
sample via visual inspection of the Gaia spectra and publicly available images
of the objects. We re-fit the SEDs of the finally selected WDMS with VOSA using
composite models to measure their stellar parameters and we search for
eclipsing systems by inspecting available ZTF and CRTS light curves. The
catalogue consists of 1312 WDMS and we manage to derive stellar parameters for
435. This is because most WDMS are dominated by the main-sequence companions,
making it hard to derive parameters for the white dwarfs. We also identify 67
eclipsing systems and estimate a lower limit to the completeness of the sample
to be ~50% (~5% if we consider that not all WDMS in the studied region have
Gaia spectra). Our catalogue increases by one order of magnitude the
volume-limited sample we presented in our previous work. Despite the fact that
the sample is incomplete and suffers from heavy observational biases, it is
well characterised and can therefore be used to further constrain binary
evolution by comparing the observed properties to those from synthetic samples
obtained modeling the WDMS population in the Galaxy, taking into account all
selection effects.

*C. Duque-Arribas,H. M. Tabernero,D. Montes,J. A. Caballero,E. Galceran*

**TL;DR**: This paper introduces a machine learning-based method using artificial neural networks to accurately estimate the photometric metallicities of M dwarfs, surpassing the accuracy of traditional approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: M dwarfs are the most abundant stars in the Galaxy and are important for stellar and exoplanetary studies, but determining their metallicities is challenging due to their complex spectra. Previous efforts have focused on photometric estimates, but the application of artificial neural networks to this problem remains unexplored.

Data: The study used a dataset of M dwarfs with spectroscopically derived metallicities, along with eight absolute magnitudes in the visible and infrared from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE.

Method: An artificial neural network was trained on the dataset, employing batch normalization and dropout regularization to stabilize training and prevent overfitting. The Monte Carlo dropout technique was used for robust predictions.

Result: The neural network achieved strong performance, estimating photometric metallicities for M dwarfs with uncertainties as low as 0.08dex, surpassing previous methods. Validation with an additional sample of 46 M dwarfs in wide binary systems confirmed the method's accuracy, exceeding the 0.1dex error threshold.

Abstract: M dwarfs are the most abundant stars in the Galaxy and serve as key targets
for stellar and exoplanetary studies. It is particularly challenging to
determine their metallicities because their spectra are complex. For this
reason, several authors have focused on photometric estimates of the M-dwarf
metallicity. Although artificial neural networks have been used in the
framework of modern astrophysics, their application to a photometric
metallicity estimate for M dwarfs remains unexplored. We develop an accurate
method for estimating the photometric metallicities of M dwarfs using
artificial neural networks to address the limitations of traditional empirical
approaches. We trained a neural network on a dataset of M dwarfs with
spectroscopically derived metallicities. We used eight absolute magnitudes in
the visible and infrared from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE as input features. Batch
normalization and dropout regularization stabilized the training and prevented
overfitting. We applied the Monte Carlo dropout technique to obtain more robust
predictions. The neural network demonstrated a strong performance in estimating
photometric metallicities for M dwarfs in the range of -0.45<[Fe/H]<0.45dex and
for spectral types as late as M5.0V. On the test sample, the predictions showed
uncertainties down to 0.08dex. This surpasses the accuracy of previous methods.
We further validated our results using an additional sample of 46 M dwarfs in
wide binary systems with FGK-type primary stars with well-defined metallicities
and achieved an excellent predictive performance that surpassed the 0.1dex
error threshold. This study introduces a ML-based framework for estimating the
photometric metallicities of M dwarfs and provides a scalable data-driven
solution for analyzing large photometric surveys. The results outline the
potential of artificial neural networks to enhance the determination of stellar
parameters.

Abstract: We assess the accuracy of radial velocities of 671 stars located near
Galactic clusters, measured by Robert Trumpler between 1924 and 1947 using the
Lick Observatory 36 inch refractor equipped with prism spectrometers. We find
that Trumpler's velocities share the same zero-point and scale as modern IAU
radial velocity standards. Their accuracy ranges from 2 to 7 km/s. We also
provide star identifications, B-band photometry, and notes for many stars. We
provide a link to an online PDF that contains all 3,782 of Trumpler's
individual stellar radial velocities and associated Julian dates. Trumpler's
velocities provide a century-long baseline for detecting long-period stellar
companions, gravitational perturbations from passing massive objects, and
accelerations due to cluster and Galactic dynamics.

Method: 运行不同恒星相遇配置的N体模拟，探索近距离恒星飞越是否能满足观测约束。

Result: 结果表明，场恒星的飞越无法生成足够的天体群体，而出生星团内的飞越未能产生原始轨道排列。满足极端海王星外天体倾角约束的飞越必须是共面（i⋆∼0度）或对称于黄道面（ω⋆∼0度，i⋆∼90度）。此类事件发生的可能性较低（≤5%）。

Abstract: Sedna-like objects (a.k.a. sednoids) are transneptunian objects (TNOs)
characterized by large semimajor axes and exceptionally high perihelia. Their
high-$q$ orbits are detached from the influence of the four giant planets and
need extra perturbation to form. One hypothesis posits that close stellar
flybys could have perturbed objects from the primordial scattering disk,
generating the sednoid population. In this study, we run N-body simulations
with different stellar encounter configurations to explore whether such a close
stellar flyby can satisfy new constraints identified from sednoid (and detached
extreme TNO) observation, including the low-inclination ($i<30^\circ$) profile
and primordial orbital alignment. Our results suggest that flybys with field
stars are unable to generate a sufficient population, whereas flybys within the
birth cluster fail to produce the primordial orbital alignment. To meet the
inclination constraint of detached extreme TNOs, flybys have to be either
coplanar ($i_\star \sim 0^\circ$) or symmetric about the ecliptic plane
($\omega_\star \sim 0^\circ, i_\star \sim 90^\circ$). After taking into account
their occurrence rate at the early stage of the Solar System, we conclude that
close-in stellar flybys ($q_\star \le 1000$~au) that satisfy all constraints
are unlikely to happen ($\lesssim$5\%). Future discoveries of additional
sednoids with precise orbital determinations are crucial to confirm the
existence of the low-inclination tendency and the primordial alignment, and to
further constrain the early dynamical evolution of the Solar System.

Abstract: We present a complete forward model of a realistic weak lensing galaxy
catalogue based on the 740 Mpc hydrodynamical MillenniumTNG (MTNG) simulation.
Starting with a complete particle and cell lightcone covering one octant of the
sky with redshift range 0 < $z$ < 1.5, we apply a group and subhalo finder to
generate the corresponding galaxy catalogue for a fiducial observer. For all
galaxies, we compute both their intrinsic and lensing-induced shear. The
intrinsic component is derived from the luminosity-weighted inertia tensor of
stellar particles, while the extrinsic (gravitational) shear is obtained
through full-sky ray-tracing on the same lightcone. This allows us to directly
predict the impact of intrinsic alignment (IA) of galaxies on the shear
correlation function and popular convergence statistics in a fully non-linear
forward model. We find that IA modifies the convergence power spectrum at all
angular scales by up to 20%, it significantly impacts the PDF, altering its
tails by 10-20%, and distorts peak and minimum counts up to 30%, depending on
redshift and scale. We also evaluate the impact of the IA signal on the shear
correlation function finding that, along with a redshift dependence, the signal
strongly increases for higher galaxy stellar mass cuts applied to the
catalogue. Notably, with the highest stellar mass cut we apply, the intrinsic
shear autocorrelation can become comparable to the gravitational shear
component on small angular scales. Our results highlight the importance of
accurately modeling IA for precision weak lensing cosmology with upcoming Stage
IV surveys.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 传统上，CMB光学深度τCMB被视为再电离过程中点的约束，但最近的Lyα森林观测和建模对再电离的最后10-20%时间提供了严格限制，使得这一解释更加复杂。

Data: DESI DR2 BAO数据、Planck低ℓ偏振数据、Lyα森林观测数据、南极点望远镜的pkSZ效应上限数据。

Method: 通过比较τCMB的高值和低值与pkSZ效应的上限，分析再电离过程的持续时间和中点。

Result: 研究发现，τCMB=0.09的值与南极点望远镜的pkSZ效应上限存在约2σ的张力。

Abstract: Recently, it was pointed out that invoking a large value of the CMB optical
depth, $\tau_{\rm CMB} = 0.09$, could help resolve tensions between DESI DR2
BAO data and the CMB. This is larger than the value of $\tau_{\rm CMB} = 0.058$
measured from the Planck low-$\ell$ polarization data. Traditionally,
$\tau_{\rm CMB}$ is thought of as a constraint on reionization's midpoint.
However, recent observations and modeling of the Ly$\alpha$ forest of high-$z$
quasars at $5 < z < 6$ have tightly constrained the timing of the last
$10-20\%$ of reionization, adding nuance to this interpretation. Here, we point
out that fixing reionization's endpoint, in accordance with the latest
Ly$\alpha$ forest constraints, renders $\tau_{\rm CMB}$ a sensitive probe of
the duration of reionization, as well as its midpoint. We compare low and high
values of $\tau_{\rm CMB}$ to upper limits on the patchy kinematic
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (pkSZ) effect, another CMB observable that constrains
reionization's duration, and find that a value of $\tau_{\rm CMB} = 0.09$ is in
$\approx 2\sigma$ tension with existing limits on the pkSZ from the South Pole
Telescope.

*Marta Cocco,Gianluca Grignani,Troels Harmark,Marta Orselli,Daniele Pica*

**TL;DR**: The study explores precession resonances in binary systems orbiting a supermassive black hole, revealing a richer resonance spectrum due to relativistic tidal effects compared to Newtonian dynamics.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Binary systems of compact objects near supermassive black holes (SMBHs) offer a unique environment to study strong-gravity tidal effects on their dynamics. Current research aims to understand these effects, particularly the precession resonances between the binary's periastron precession frequency and its orbital frequencies around the SMBH.

Data: The study models the SMBH as a Schwarzschild black hole and analyzes the quadrupolar tidal interaction in the strong-gravity regime.

Method: The research employs both perturbative and numerical analyses to investigate the tidal interactions and precession resonances in the binary system.

Result: The findings show that relativistic tidal effects produce a significantly richer resonance spectrum than Newtonian dynamics, revealing new signatures for strong-gravity effects in such triple systems, with implications for gravitational-wave astronomy.

Abstract: Binary systems of compact objects in close orbit around a supermassive black
hole (SMBH) may form in galactic nuclei, providing a unique environment to
probe strong-gravity tidal effects on the binary's dynamics. In this work, we
investigate precession resonances arising between the periastron precession
frequency of a binary system and its orbital frequencies around the SMBH. By
modeling the SMBH as a Schwarzschild black hole, we find that relativistic
effects in the tidal field give rise to a significantly richer resonance
spectrum compared to the Newtonian case. This result is supported by both
perturbative and numerical analyses of the quadrupolar tidal interaction in the
strong-gravity regime. Our results reveal new signatures for strong-gravity
effects in such triple systems, with potential implications for
gravitational-wave astronomy.
