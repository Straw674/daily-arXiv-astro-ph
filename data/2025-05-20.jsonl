Furthermore, the HOD of these regions\nexhibits significant deviations from the average, as shown by several studies\nin semi-analytical models, hydrodynamic simulations, and observations. This\npaper investigates the temporal evolution of the HOD in cosmic voids from\nredshift z = 0.5 to the present day. We aim to understand how the void\nenvironment shapes galaxy occupation over time and to identify the factors\ndriving the unique HOD observed in these underdense regions. We use the\nMDPL2-SAG semi-analytic galaxy catalog and identify spherical cosmic voids at\ndifferent redshifts. We analyze the HOD within voids across ten simulation\nsnapshots, comparing it with the global HOD. Furthermore, we trace the\nevolution of z = 0 void galaxies and their host halos back in time, examining\ntheir formation times and local density evolution. Our results reveal that the\nHOD within voids is consistently lower than the average HOD at all redshifts\nconsidered. Tracking z = 0 void galaxies, we find that their HOD remains lower\nthan average throughout the redshift range, with no significant redshift\nevolution in this relative difference. Analysis of halo formation histories\nshows that lower-mass void halos are younger, while massive void halos are\nolder compared to the average. Spatially, lower-mass halos are found in the\ninner void regions, whereas massive halos are located closer to void\nboundaries. The local density of massive void halos decreases significantly\ntowards z = 0, contrasting with the relatively stable local density of\nlower-mass void halos."}

While four\nbands have been associated with the fullerene cation (C^+_60) the vast majority\n(> 550) remain unidentified. This works is an attempt to provide a conceptual\nframework for the typical energy transitions that are central to explaining the\norigin of DIBs, however, it does not make an association between these\ntransitions and any particular DIBs. The effect of quantum confinement on\nexcitons is used, including charge transfer excitons, to construct a generic\nbasis for the electronic transitions that could, in principle, be coherent with\nthe energies associated with DIBs. In this model the carriers are carbon\nnanodots (CNDs) modelled as nanodiamonds and a-C(:H) nanoparticles. These\npreliminary results seem to show that particle size dependent effects in\nnanodiamond and a-C(:H) CNDs could be consistent with the positions of, and\nintervals between, some of the DIBs. One particular strength of the model is\nthat predicts single bands from the majority of single-size particles and, at\nmost, two bands from some of these same carriers. In the latter case the two\nbands come from different transitions and may or may not inter-correlate,\ndepending upon the local environment. This generic framework indicates that the\nsize dependent fundamental transitions in CNDs could provide a viable scenario\nfor the origin of some DIB-type bands. While this work does not identify a\nsingle DIB, it furnishes a conceptual view for the DIB origin, and suggests\nthat a more refined exploration of quantum confinement size effects, and\nexciton physics within the astronomical domain might prove fruitful.

Recent H$_2$CO observations showed two elongated\nstructures with hints of outflowing motion almost perpendicular to the main CO\noutflow, which is launched from the circumbinary disk. With the aim of\nverifying the nature of these elongated structures, we analyze the line\nemission of H$^{13}$CO$^+$, CCH, c-C$_3$H$_2$ and SiO observed with ALMA within\nthe Large Program FAUST. These molecules trace material moving at velocities\nclose to the ambient cloud velocity. The images of H$^{13}$CO$^+$, CCH,\nc-C$_3$H$_2$ show the elongated structures, whose gas kinematics are consistent\nwith outflowing motions and with rotation in the opposite sense to the main CO\noutflow. The derived mass loss rate from these large-scale structures is\n$(1.8\\pm0.5)\\times10^{-6}M_{\\odot}\\textrm{ yr}^{-1}$, in agreement with those\nmeasured in outflows driven by Class 0/I protostars.
