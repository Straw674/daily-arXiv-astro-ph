We\ndetect 499 $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ masers across the observed velocities between -39\nand 172 km s$^{-1}$. To investigate the nature of the masers, we analyze their\nspatial distribution and cross-match with catalogs of HII regions and\nprotostellar cores. 62% of masers are associated with protostellar cores and\n32% with HII regions. The nature of the remaining 6% of sources was not\nestablished, but is likely associated with protostellar cores. Based on the\nspatial extent of the groups of masers, we classify them as either\noutflow-associated or young stellar object (YSO)-associated. We identify 144\nunique sites of maser emission: 23 are associated with HII regions and 94 with\nprotostellar cores, of which 33 are associated with protostellar outflows and\n18 with YSOs.\n  The outflow-associated $\\mathrm{H_2O}$ maser emission is confined to within\n$<2000$ au of the central continuum source, despite shocked SiO emission\nextending over tens of thousands of au. The YSO-associated masers show a lack\nof detections at $5 < V_{rel} < 30$ km s$^{-1}$, which we suggest may be due to\nmaser self-absorption.

We employ three different theoretical models: an analytical\ntoy model; a set of test particle simulations with steady and slowing bars; and\na cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy. Each model\npredicts that the bar increases the angular momentum and energy spread of\nlow-energy substructures by a factor of $\\sim10-100$, so they cannot remain\ntightly clustered. We derive a criterion for determining when this effect is\nimportant.

The\ncircumgalactic medium (CGM) provides a helpful laboratory to study this\nprocess, as its metallicity, temperature, and density distributions are\ndirectly impacted by AGN.

The CO\nline ratios (especially CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) - $R_{21}$) vary within and among\ngalaxies, yet previous studies on $R_{21}$ and alike often rely on measurements\nconstructed by combining data from facilities with substantial relative\ncalibration uncertainties that have the same order as physical line ratio\nvariations. Hence robustly determining systematic $R_{21}$ variations is\nchallenging. Here, we compare CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) mapping data from ALMA for 14\nnearby galaxies, at a common physical resolution of 1.7 kpc. Our dataset\nincludes new ALMA (7m+TP) CO(1-0) maps of 12 galaxies. We investigate $R_{21}$\nvariation to understand its dependence on global galaxy properties, kpc-scale\nenvironmental factors, and its correlation with star formation rate (SFR)\nsurface density and metallicity. We find that the galaxy-to-galaxy scatter is\n0.05 dex. This is lower than previous studies which reported over 0.1 dex\nvariation, likely reflecting significant flux calibration uncertainties in\nsingle-dish surveys. Within individual galaxies, $R_{21}$ has a typical mean\nvalue of ~0.64 and 0.1 dex variation, with an increase to ~0.75 towards\ngalactic centers. We find strong correlations between $R_{21}$ and various\ngalactic parameters, particularly SFR surface density, which shows a power-law\nslope of 0.10-0.11 depending on the adopted binning/fitting methods. Our\nfindings suggest that, for studies covering main sequence galaxy samples,\nassuming a fixed $R_{21}$=0.64 does not significantly bias kpc-scale molecular\ngas mass estimates from CO(2-1). Instead, systematic uncertainties from flux\ncalibration and the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor account for more systematic\nscatter of CO-derived molecular gas properties.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7ALMA\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e8614\u4e2a\u90bb\u8fd1\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2dCO(1-0)\u548cCO(2-1)\u7684\u7ebf\u6bd4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u661f\u7cfb\u95f4\u7ebf\u6bd4\u53d8\u5316\u8f83\u5c0f\uff080.05 dex\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "background": "CO(1-0)\u548cCO(2-1)\u662f\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u793a\u8e2a\u5242\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee5\u5f80\u7814\u7a76\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u6821\u51c6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u786e\u5b9a\u7ebf\u6bd4\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387ALMA\u6570\u636e\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "data": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86ALMA\u89c2\u6d4b\u768414\u4e2a\u90bb\u8fd1\u661f\u7cfb\u7684CO(1-0)\u548cCO(2-1)\u6620\u5c04\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u62ec12\u4e2a\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u65b0ALMA (7m+TP) CO(1-0)\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83CO(1-0)\u548cCO(2-1)\u7684\u7ebf\u6bd4\uff08R21\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4e0e\u661f\u7cfb\u5168\u5c40\u6027\u8d28\u3001kpc\u5c3a\u5ea6\u73af\u5883\u56e0\u7d20\u3001\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u661f\u7cfb\u95f4\u7ebf\u6bd4\u53d8\u5316\u8f83\u5c0f\uff080.05 dex\uff09\uff0c\u4e14R21\u4e0e\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u7387\u8868\u9762\u5bc6\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u76f8\u5173\uff08\u5e42\u5f8b\u659c\u73870.10-0.11\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u661f\u7cfb\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u56fa\u5b9aR21=0.64\u4e0d\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u5b50\u6c14\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Angular momentum exchange at bar\nresonances drives secular morphological changes throughout the disk, including\nbar slowing and lengthening, and affects the structure of accompanying bulges.\nIn this study, using a suite of N-body simulations, we quantify the secular\nreconfiguration of classical bulges through resonant trapping by evolving\nstellar bars.

A decrease of wB by 45% and a positive shift of lB by 70-80 Ang were\nmeasured. In the MW, the uvB amplitude hB and wB do vary; however, such a\nnarrow bump has never been observed and no variability of lB has been\nconvincingly found. Recently, links have been found between both hB and wB and\nthe strength of several Diffuse Interstellar absorption Bands (DIBs). They were\nfound to be limited to the sigma-type DIBs and their detection to be strongly\nfavored if the data were limited to monocloud-type lines-of-sight, selected\nbased on 3D dust maps. We extended the study of the links between MW DIBs and\nuvB to the lB value and to the hB to continuum ratio, and compared MW\nvariations of the bump parameters to high z values. We used the 5780 and 6284 A\nsigma, and 5797 and 5850 A zeta DIBs. Similarly to hB and wB, lB reacts to the\nabundance of sigma carriers and is insensitive to the abundance of zeta DIB\ncarriers, which dominate in dense cloud cores. A strong abundance of sigma\ncarriers induces a shift of lB to longer wavelengths and a decrease of wB.

While\nthis is an apt description for the majority of stars with thin-disk-like\nabundances, there are a number of interesting exceptions. In this analysis, we\nidentify and investigate $\\sim 70$ stars with thin-disk-like abundances and\nvery slow or retrograde Galactocentric azimuthal velocities.

X-ray SNRs in galaxies\nbeyond the Local Group are rare, mainly due to the limited sensitivity of\ncurrent X-ray instruments. Additionally, their identification requires an\noptical counterpart, making incomplete optical identification methods an extra\nchallenge. Detecting X-ray SNRs in other galaxies is crucial for understanding\ntheir feedback in different evolutionary phases and gaining insights into their\nlocal interstellar medium. In NGC 7793, only one X-ray SNR was previously\nknown, while a recent study reported nearly 240 optical SNRs. The discovery of\na new, larger optical SNR sample motivated a re-examination of the X-ray SNR\npopulation by comparing optical SNRs with X-ray sources. To identify X-ray\nSNRs, we utilised Chandra's spatial resolution and analysed all available\narchival data of NGC 7793, totaling 229.9 ks over 19 years. After data\nreduction, we performed source detection and analysis, searching for X-ray\nsources coinciding with optical SNRs. We also used XMM-Newton for spectral\nanalysis of the confirmed and candidate SNRs. We detected 58 X-ray sources down\nto an observed luminosity of $\\sim 1.5\\times 10^{36}\\, erg\\, s^{-1}$. Among\nthem, five X-ray counterparts to optical SNRs were identified, all presenting\nsoft emission (<1.2 keV) with no short- or long-term variability. One\ncorresponds to the previously known X-ray SNR, while four are newly detected.\nSpectral modeling of two SNRs shows thermal spectra exceeding 2.5 million K,\nwith strong OVII, OVIII, and NeIX emission lines. A correlation between\ndensity, X-ray luminosity, and source softness was observed.

For the first time, XRISM's Resolve microcalorimeter enables a detailed\ncharacterization of the highly ionized outflows in this active galactic\nnucleus. Our analysis constrains their outflow and turbulent velocities, along\nwith their ionization parameter $\\xi$ and column density $N_{\\rm H}$. The\nhigh-resolution Resolve spectrum reveals a distinct series of Fe absorption\nlines between 6.4 and 7.8 keV, ranging from Fe XVIII to Fe XXVI. At lower\nenergies, absorption features from Si, S, and Ar are also detected. Our\nspectroscopy and photoionization modeling of the time-averaged Resolve spectrum\nuncover six outflow components, five of which exhibit relatively narrow\nabsorption lines, with outflow velocities ranging from 560 to 1170 km/s. In\naddition, a broad absorption feature is detected, which is consistent with Fe\nXXVI outflowing at 14,300 km/s (0.05 $c$). This component carries a kinetic\nluminosity of 0.8-3% of the bolometric luminosity. Our analysis of the Resolve\nspectrum shows that more highly ionized absorption lines are intrinsically\nbroader than those of lower ionization species, indicating that the turbulent\nvelocity of the six outflow components (ranging from 0 to 3500 km/s) increases\nwith $\\xi$. Furthermore, we find that the $N_{\\rm H}$ of the outflows generally\ndeclines with $\\xi$ up to $\\log \\xi = 3.2$, but rises beyond this point,\nsuggesting a complex ionization structure. Examination of the absorption\nprofile of the Fe XXV resonance line reveals intriguing similarities to UV\nabsorption lines (Ly$\\alpha$ and C IV) observed by the HST, from which we infer\nthat the outflows are clumpy in nature. Our XRISM/Resolve results support a\n'hybrid wind' scenario, in which the outflows have multiple origins and driving\nmechanisms.

We\npresent an X-ray source catalog with 202 sources and provide their coordinates,\nmulti-band flux information and hardness ratios. We find a statistically\nsignificant excess at a significance level of $4.2\\sigma$ with 37.6 excess\nsources beyond three times the mean effective radius of the two BCGs. This\nimplies that these excess sources could be a genuine intracluster X-ray\npopulation that is not associated with the bulk stellar component. Also, the\nincreased number of excess sources in the fields containing a BCG implies a\npotential connection between the excess sources and BCGs. The discovery of\nthese sources in the Antlia cluster, together with previous research of similar\nfindings in other two nearby clusters, Virgo and Fornax, indicates that the\nintracluster X-ray population could be universal in nearby galaxy clusters.\nFurthermore, we discuss the candidate origins of the excess sources, including\nlow-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) associated with intracluster light (ICL-LMXBs),\nLMXBs in globular clusters (GC-LMXBs) and supernova-kicked LMXBs (SN-kicked\nLMXBs). We estimate the contribution of ICL-LMXBs, which should include the\nLMXBs relating with the stellar halo surrounding BCGs, are unlikely to dominate\nthe intracluster X-ray population in Antlia.
