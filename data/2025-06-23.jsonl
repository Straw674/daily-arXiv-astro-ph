We present a hybrid cooling model for\ncosmological simulations that incorporates a comprehensive treatment of\nradiative processes, including parameterizations of the interstellar radiation\nfield, cosmic ray rates, and dust physics. The model uses the chimes chemical\nnetwork and combines on-the-fly non-equilibrium calculations with\nquasi-equilibrium cooling rates. The quasi-equilibrium rates account for the\ntime-dependent free electron fractions of elements tracked in non-equilibrium,\nbalancing computational efficiency with physical accuracy. We evaluate the\nperformance under various conditions, including the thermal evolution of\nprimordial gas at the cosmic mean density, the properties of the warm and cold\nneutral media in Milky Way-like galaxies, and the atomic-to-molecular hydrogen\ntransition. We demonstrate that thermal equilibrium predictions for the neutral\nphases of the ISM underestimate the median gas pressures in simulations of\nisolated galaxies by up to 0.5 dex. Finally we find that the\natomic-to-molecular hydrogen transition is shifted to lower densities by up to\n1 dex if oxygen is not included in the chemical network.

Also, combining the equations of energy balance for a fluid\nelement, we arrive at the conclusion that the cloud layers far from the centre\nare in a stable dynamical state if the accretion velocity flow is sub- or\ntranssonic; otherwise they are marginally stable (moderately supersonic flow)\nor unstable (supersonic flow). Both solutions are consistent only if the\naccretion flow is subsonic and hence the outer layers are stable. Finally,\nunder the assumption that both the accretion velocity and density scale with\n$\\ell$ and their power-law exponents are position-independent, we show that the\ndensity scaling exponent far away from the centre is $p=2$ and this value is an\nattractor.

We then update the GRALE model using the 303 multiple images, finding\nthat one of the two galaxy scale LUMC, M1, is no longer significant, while M2\nremains. We test M2 by explicitely including it in our parametric model. We\nfind that the inclusion of this LUMC does not improve the global RMS, but\nmildly improves locally the RMS for one multiple image located close to M2.\nBesides, the preferred mass for M2 corresponds to the lowest mass allowed by\nthe adopted prior. M2 is therefore not strongly favoured by a parametric\napproach but it is not ruled out. We present a comparison of parametric and\nnon-parametric models in the M2 area. Both approaches show very similar surface\nmass density at this location, with a 5-6 % difference between the mass maps.\nThe difference is that GRALE favors a distinct mass substructure when LENSTOOL\nfavors a more diffuse mass distribution.

In this context, the\n  observed UFG class we show corresponds to a relatively heavy boson of\n$3\\times 10^{-21}$eV, including Leo K \\& M, whereas a lighter axion of\n$10^{-22}$eV comprises the bulk of dark matter in all larger galaxies including\nthe dSph's. Although Leo M is larger in size than Leo K, we predict its\nvelocity dispersion to be smaller $\\simeq 1.7$km/s, compared to $\\simeq\n4.5$km/s for Leo K, since soliton cores are required by the Uncertainty\nPrinciple to be wider at lower momentum. This scenario can be definitively\ntested using millisecond pulsars close to the Galactic center, where the\nCompton frequencies of the heavy and light bosons imprint monotone timing\nresiduals that may be detected by SKA on timescales of approximately 1 week and\n4 months, respectively."}

The first realistic\ncosmological models were proposed in the works of Friedman, written in the\n1920s. For a long time Friedman's cosmological works were actually banned in\nSoviet Union due to philosophical reasons, since the models where the birth and\nevolution of the Universe occurs were considered ideologically unacceptable.\nDue to great achievements in relativity and cosmology and due to increasing\ninterest to these branches of of science in last decades we recall a\ndevelopment of relativistic astrophysics and contribution of Russian\nresearchers in these studies. Since one of the world leaders in physical\ncosmology A. A. Friedman passed away in September 1925, it is reasonable to\noutline the main achievements of physical cosmology over the past 100 years. We\ndiscuss also observational and theoretical achievements in confirmations of\nrelativistic observational predictions for black holes, including the closest\nsupermassive black hole in our Galactic Center. We outline an evolution of\nblack hole shadow from the purely theoretical concept to observable quantities\nfor supermassive black holes in Sgr A* and M87*."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "Detecting orbital eccentricity in a stellar-mass black-hole merger would\npoint to a non-isolated formation channel. Eccentric binaries can form in dense\nstellar environments such as globular clusters or active galactic nuclei, or\nfrom triple stellar systems in the Galactic field. However, confidently\nmeasuring eccentricity is challenging -- short signals from high-mass eccentric\nmergers can mimic spin-induced precession, making the two effects hard to\ndisentangle. This degeneracy weakens considerably for longer-duration signals.\nHere, GW200208_222617 provides a rare opportunity. Originating from a\nrelatively low-mass binary with source-frame chirp mass $\\sim20$ M$_\\odot$, its\ngravitational-wave signal spanned $\\sim14$ orbital cycles in band, with no\nindication of data quality issues. Previous analyses for quasi-circular\nbinaries found no evidence for spin precession and, multiple subsequent studies\nfound the data to favour an eccentric merger despite notable technical\ndifferences. All in all, we believe GW200208_222617 is the black-hole merger\nevent from GWTC-3 with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity. We\npresent a critical discussion of properties and astrophysical interpretation of\nGW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole merger using models of field\ntriples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei. We find that if\nGW200208_222617 was indeed eccentric, its origin is consistent with a field\ntriple or globular cluster. Formation in the inner regions of an active\ngalactic nucleus is disfavoured. The outer regions of such a disk remain a\nviable origin for GW200208_222617; we demonstrate how future detections of\neccentric mergers formed in such environments could be powerful tools for\nconstraining the disk geometry."}
