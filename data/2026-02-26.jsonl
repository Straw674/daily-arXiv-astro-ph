Ongoing tidal disruption may help explain the discrepancies, as evidenced by the recent discovery of tidal tails. Here we present metallicity-sensitive narrowband photometry of the Ca II H and K lines from the Dark Energy Camera, covering $128$ deg$^2$ across the center and identified tidal tails of CraII as part of the Mapping the Ancient Galaxy in CaHK (MAGIC) survey. Our combined photometric metallicity, color-magnitude, proper motion, and parallax selections identify 162 CraII candidates. Of these, 37 candidates are located in the tidal tails which extend at least $7^\\circ$ ($\\sim 95$ kpc) from the center of CraII, suggesting it has lost $\\gtrsim 25$% of its initial stellar mass. We confirm low contamination rates with dedicated control fields and highlight the extremely low surface brightness stellar features that can be uncovered with CaHK data, as faint as $\\sim 36$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We also make the first detection of a metallicity gradient ($-0.34\\pm0.17~{\\rm dex}~{\\rm deg}^{-1}$) in the center of the galaxy and infer a stream width of $w\\sim 0.8^\\circ$, roughly 50% larger than the CraII half-light radius. The detection of candidates in the most distant CraII pointings from its center implies that the tidal tails extend beyond our footprint. We compare the CraII stream to $N$-body models with \"cored\" and \"cuspy\" dark matter halo progenitors, determining that CraII's density profile is still ambiguous and warrants further modeling."}

Integral field spectroscopy allows us to correct for this effect and study both the unobscured cores of AGN host galaxies as well as the uncontaminated spectra of their central engines with unprecedented precision. Using MUSE WFM observations, in this work, we present a combined method for modelling and subtracting QSO light in type-1 AGN alongside results for one such source, PKS 2153-68 (z=0.028), both jetted and gamma-ray emitting.

Accepted for publication in Nature Astronomy", "summary": "Star formation in galaxies is governed by internal and environmental processes, yet their relative roles are not well understood. In particular, uncertainties in measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies, combined with modeling limitations, obfuscate the impact of supermassive black hole feedback across environments and over time. Here we address this with a comprehensive analysis of ~60,000 nearby AGNs (z < 0.15 and new environment and halo-mass measurements for ~500,000 AGN and non-AGN host galaxies. This benchmark enables unified comparisons with three prominent cosmological simulations--SIMBA, TNG, and EAGLE--and reveals major, contrasting shortcomings. Simulations fail to reproduce observed trends linking star formation, quiescence, AGN luminosity, stellar mass, and halo mass. While simulations qualitatively capture that AGNs are more common in low-mass halos than in rich groups or clusters, detailed host demographics diverge strongly from observations. Partial agreement exists in the stellar mass distribution within large-scale structures, yet all simulations overproduce quenched low-mass satellites in massive halos, while misrepresenting quenched fractions of massive central galaxies and those in low-density environments, which are sensitive to feedback implementation. Improved AGN physics and modeling of multi-phase gas cooling and flows are required to capture the observed interplay between black holes, galaxies, and halos."}

Using nebular and continuum emission maps, we find that Paschen emission covers a smaller area than continuum emission observed in the F210M (2.1 $μ$m; rest-frame optical) and F444W (4.4 $μ$m; rest-frame near-IR) bands, and is preferentially located toward galaxy outskirts. These results suggest that current star formation is concentrated in regions farther from galaxy centers than older stellar populations traced by the continuum, indicative of inside-out star formation. With a careful accounting of slit-loss corrections for ground-based measurements, we calculate nebular reddening and dust-corrected SFRs using the Balmer decrement (H$α$/H$β$) and Paschen-to-Balmer line ratios (Pa$α$/H$α$ and Pa$β$/H$α$), assuming the Milky Way extinction curve. On average, Paschen-derived reddening and SFRs agree with Balmer-derived values; however, two galaxies exhibit significantly higher Paschen reddening and four show significantly higher Paschen SFRs. We find that non-unity dust covering fractions bias the Balmer decrement toward less reddened OB associations, while decrements involving the Paschen lines are less affected by this bias. These results highlight the enhanced sensitivity of the Paschen lines to the most heavily obscured OB associations in $z\\sim2$ galaxies, particularly in galaxies with patchy dust geometries. Future studies using Paschen lines exclusively to measure nebular reddening will yield more robust constraints on the dustiest star-forming regions."}

Our framework consists of a volumetric Convolutional Neural Network to classify individual simulation particles as either halo or non-halo members, followed by a highly optimised and parallelised Friends-of-Friends clustering algorithm that groups the classified halo members into distinct haloes. The training data comprise simulations generated using GADGET-4, with labels obtained with the ROCKSTAR halo finder. Our models incorporate two main halo mass definitions, $M_{200\\mathrm{b}}$ and $M_{\\text{vir}}$, with similar performance. For haloes defined by the ROCKSTAR $M_{200\\mathrm{b}}$ criterion, the classification network demonstrated stable performance across multiple simulation resolutions. For the highest resolution, it achieved over $98\\%$ across all primary performance metrics when identifying halo particles. Furthermore, the FoF algorithm yielded halo catalogues with a purity generally exceeding $95\\%$ and a stable completeness of $93\\%$ for masses above $5\\times10^{11} \\, M_\\odot$.

Using void catalogs from four Millennium Simulation snapshots and SDSS data at $z<0.04$, we perform a unified analysis of void demographics, galaxy properties, and internal kinematics. Our analysis reveals clear evidence that cosmic voids exhibit a significant evolutionary trend of becoming progressively emptier toward low redshift, accompanied by a marked decline in the brightness and clustering of their galaxy populations. The void galaxy luminosity function evolves significantly: $M^{*}$ fades and $α$ flattens with time, with large voids hosting brighter, more rapidly evolving galaxies than small voids. Stacked density profiles exhibit a universal shape when scaled by void radius, deepening and building more pronounced walls toward $z=0$. Galaxy spatial distributions reveal persistent size-dependent segregation, with galaxies in large voids lying farther from the center and more strongly clustered. Dynamical analysis of simulations shows coherent outward flows in all voids, with amplitudes decreasing toward $z=0$, providing a physical basis for observed redshift-space distortions. Comparison with SDSS broadly confirms these evolutionary trends but uncovers a non-zero central galaxy population in observed voids -- absent in $Λ$CDM predictions -- that may challenge current galaxy formation models in extreme underdensities. Future comparisons with additional simulations and deeper high-redshift surveys will provide stronger tests of $Λ$CDM in the most underdense regions."}

These measurements are consistent with those reported by the EHT Collaboration. The results are significant because we demonstrate that: (1) imaging from interferometric aperture synthesis data, especially in VLBI and most acutely in extremely sparse arrays like the EHT, remains a severely ill-posed and challenging inverse problem, yet closure invariants preserve robust morphological information that can strongly constrain structural features, and (2) more importantly, closure-invariant imaging largely avoids calibration systematics, thus providing a fundamentally independent view of spatial structure with very high angular resolution. The generative nature of GenDIReCT further allows us to sample and characterise clusters of plausible image solutions for each dataset. As a calibration-independent, generative imaging approach, GenDIReCT offers a robust and truly independent blind-imaging tool for current and future VLBI experiments."}

Both galaxies show predominantly solenoidal driving on average for the regions where we find valid results ($b\\geq 0.33(\\pm 0.05)^{+0.14}_{-0.10}$ in NGC7793; $b\\geq 0.24(\\pm 0.03)^{+0.10}_{-0.07}$ in NGC1313), noting that this is without including the influences of magnetic fields, making these measurements lower limits. We find substantial spatial variation of b, including localised regions of strongly compressive driving. NGC1313 exhibits higher turbulent Mach numbers and density dispersions than NGC7793, consistent with the disturbed morphology and recent satellite interaction in NGC1313. The turbulence in both NGC7793 and NGC1313 is supersonic ($3\\lesssim M\\lesssim 20$), and NGC1313 shows a radially decreasing trend of M with galactocentric radius. Radial trends indicate more solenoidal driving in the galaxy centres, potentially reflecting enhanced shear, and increasingly compressive modes in the outskirts. These results demonstrate that turbulence driving varies systematically with galactic environment and cannot be assumed uniform across discs. Our study applies a previously established method to larger scales and new data, linking local turbulence physics to global star formation regulation in galaxies, providing a new avenue for testing theoretical models with future integral field units and ALMA surveys."}

These mergers, combined with feedback from AGN, filamentary accretion, and other energy injection processes, generate turbulence and perturbations within the intra-cluster medium (ICM). X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) observations can be utilized to measure these ICM density and pressure inhomogeneities, in turn providing constraints on the effective Equation of State (EOS) of the perturbations and ICM velocities. In this work, we analyze deep SRG-eROSITA and Planck/SPT observations of Abell 3266 (A3266), a dynamically complex merging cluster with elongated morphology and significant substructure. We measure pressure and density fluctuations, and compute the power spectra and deprojected 3D amplitudes of these perturbations. We estimate the ratio of pressure-to-density fluctuation amplitudes as $1.00 \\pm 0.55$ and non-thermal pressure support $0.068 \\pm 0.050$. Density fluctuations are found to be stronger in the northern sector of the cluster compared to the south, consistent with ongoing accretion along a filamentary structure revealed by eROSITA. Further, we find the amplitude of density fluctuations increases with radius, qualitatively consistent with the trend found in cosmological simulations.

The radio sky below 30 MHz is largely unexplored and is thought to contain spectral signatures of new physics in the early, high-redshift Universe. Achieving precision measurements in this band requires accurate understanding of antenna performance and systematics. For upcoming lunar surface radio astronomy missions, this modeling will be challenging because antennas will deploy at heights that are only a small fraction of a wavelength above the lunar regolith, where strong coupling between the antenna and the surface can significantly alter impedance, radiation patterns, and efficiency. The challenge is compounded by the layered dielectric structure of the regolith and the tendency for permittivity to increase with depth, both of which are difficult to represent faithfully in numerical simulations.\n  In this work, we review theoretical predictions for the behavior of a simple horizontal dipole above a dielectric half-space, representing the lunar regolith, and compare them with simulation results obtained using the Ansys HFSS integral equation solver. We quantify how the antenna impedance and beam pattern couple to the sky for a representative lunar surface radio astronomy experiment. The results show that surface induced effects decrease rapidly, even for modest increases in antenna height above the regolith. Conversely, a dipole antenna placed on or very near the lunar surface will exhibit complex spectral response that renders systematics control very difficult without detailed information on regolith properties."}

Invited and accepted by Universe", "summary": "We revisit the extensively debated star-forming main sequence (SFMS)-a tight correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass in both kiloparsec-resolved and integrated galaxies. We statistically explore the fundamental drivers of star formation at global scales, using a large volume-limited sample of 24,954 local star-forming galaxies to overcome the limitations of previous works. Based on the mid-infrared 12 micron luminosity, stellar mass, and g-r color, we estimate the molecular gas mass for the considered sample. At galaxy-wide scales, we establish global relations between the surface densities of the star formation rate, stellar mass, and molecular gas mass . These global density relations are connected with and follow similar trends as the resolved SFMS, the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, and the molecular gas main sequence (MGMS). Taking advantage of this large catalog, we show that the scatters in the global KS and MGMS relations are smaller than that of the global relation between the star formation rate surface density and stellar mass surface density, and their Pearson correlation coefficients are higher. More importantly, multivariate regression and partial correlation analyses demonstrate that the apparent correlation between the star formation rate surface density and stellar mass surface density is entirely mediated by the molecular gas surface density, with its best-fit parameters directly derivable from those of the KS and MGMS relations. Overall, our findings suggest that the correlation between stellar mass and molecular gas, as well as that between molecular gas and star formation, are more direct and fundamental. The star-forming main sequence thus appears to be a natural by-product of these two tighter relations."}

This paper studies the behaviour of random gravitational and plasma lenses, presenting the refractive and diffractive expansions, with higher-order terms that allow error estimates and embody the counterintuitive resurgence phenomenon.\n  Specifically, we show that the diffractive expansion converges for a broad class of bounded lens models and provides an efficient description of interference patterns across frequency regimes. Next, building on Picard-Lefschetz techniques, we derive the full refractive expansion to arbitrary order, organising it into a transseries. Near caustics, the standard transseries is supplemented with uniform asymptotics. We study this transseries, with both Borel and hyperasymptotic resummation yielding systematic approximations to lensing integrals at all frequencies. Our results give a framework for modelling wave optics lensing near caustics and beyond the geometric optics approximation and thereby illustrate how tools from resurgence and asymptotic analysis can be applied to practical problems in astrophysics.\n  Near caustic singularities, the post-refractive corrections diverge, while the uniform asymptotic expansion becomes accurate. We use the leading uniform approximation to derive the strong wave optics suppression of off-axis caustics, which clarifies their subdominant role."}

The optical light curve from ASAS-SN during the same period is consistent with a constant showing no variability. The mid-infrared color evolution shows that the galaxy transitioned into an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in 2018. The SPHEREx spectrum reveals an increasing continuum resembling warm to hot dust emission from an AGN. NuSTAR detected an X-ray source with a 2-30 keV luminosity of $8.4\\times10^{41}$ ergs/s at the lower boundary of AGN X-ray emission range, and a factor of >7 variability in one year compared to the Swift upper limit. NGC 6447 was classified as a quiescent galaxy in the literature. The multi-wavelength timing and spectral properties of NGC 6447 are consistent with the expected AGN turning on event, where the obscuring material around the AGN central engine is gradually dispersed, revealing the central engine. This example shows that long-term infrared variability can be a powerful tool to find similar sources.

The survey is structured around three connected goals: (1) improving photometric redshift (photo-z) accuracy through the combination of broad- and narrow-band photometry, enabling reliable identification of large-scale structures; (2) probing extended CGM emission with dedicated narrow-band imaging; and (3) mapping foreground IGM via absorption-line spectroscopy of background galaxies. Together, these components establish an integrated observational framework to investigate galactic ecosystems -- linking galaxies to their circumgalactic and intergalactic environments -- at cosmic noon. We show that the J-PAS-like narrow-band system used in JPCam substantially improves photo-z accuracies from only the Euclid/CSST broad-band data, especially for star-forming galaxies at z~1.0-1.4. This enables the identification of galaxy groups and (proto-)clusters directly from photo-z measurements. Stacked JPCam narrow-band imaging should also detect extended [O II]-emitting CGM halos. We then construct mock 3D gas distribution model and realistic galaxy catalog, and further construct mock CSST and JUST background galaxy spectra adding Lyalpha and Mg II absorptions. The reconstructed 3D H I field from CSST Lyalpha forest reliably recovers large-scale structures; however, our simulations indicate that detecting diffuse IGM Mg II absorption with JUST is infeasible, either through spectral stacking or via the two-point correlation function method. We conclude that constraining the metallicity of the diffuse IGM will require significantly deeper and higher-resolution spectroscopy expected from future facilities such as the 39 m E-ELT."}

Despite reaching sensitivities 10-100x deeper than most previous studies, we detect [OI]63um in emission in only 2 sources at low significance, with the remaining galaxies yielding stringent non-detections over the full velocity range covered by robust detections of other far-infrared lines, including [CII] and [NII]205um. We identify several compact (0.05-0.2\") regions having [OI]63um absorption against the far-infrared dust continuum, some of which are possibly reaching below rest-frame CMB radiation level. We also detect narrow, spatially localised [OI]63um emission \"escape channels\" preferentially detected in regions with weak or absent dust continuum emission. We predict that similar absorption effects may appear in the [CII] line, particularly when concentrating on the regions with the densest foreground material along the line of sight. The [OI]63um line appears to be originate from a mix of compact, high optical depth [OI]63um emitting regions and sub-thermally excited, oxygen-rich molecular clouds dispersed throughout high-redshift starbursts that are capable of absorbing the ground-state line emission. Combined with a comparison to cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulations, this supports the interpretation that regions with higher gas and dust column densities may lead to weakening an intrinsically strong [OI]63um line emission. We argue that the high [OI]63um optical depth is the dominant effect causing the strong absorption, limiting the diagnostic power of this line to trace regions of massive star formation in high-redshift DSFGs."}

Observational studies of this phase in dwarfs remain rare. We present a high-resolution study of the merger remnant VCC 693 in the outskirts of Virgo cluster, using observations from the Atomic gas in Virgo Interacting Dwarf galaxies (AVID) project. We explore the origin of VCC 693 and the consequences of the merger on its star formation and structure through a joint analysis of VLA and FAST HI emission line observations, together with complementary optical imaging and spectroscopy. We employ hydrodynamical simulations to help interpret the observations. Our analysis favours a near-major merger between two dwarfs with a stellar mass ratio of 3:1-4:1, with one likely gas-poor progenitor (i.e., a damp merger). The optical appearance of VCC 693 is dominated by complex tidal structures throughout the system, whereas the HI gas has settled to a regular rotating disk. Compared with similar-mass dwarfs, the central star formation and gas-phase metallicity are moderately enhanced. The global star formation rate, HI gas content, and HI-to-optical size ratio of VCC 693 are broadly consistent with those of typical dwarfs of similar mass, albeit somewhat lower. Decomposition of the HI rotation curve into baryonic and dark matter indicates a high halo concentration, suggesting post-merger relaxation into a more centrally peaked configuration. Together with two recent studies of AVID post-merger systems, these results support the view that even major dwarf mergers can produce remnants with overall stellar structures indistinguishable from ordinary dwarfs, and that the environmental effects in cluster outskirts can promote damp or mixed mergers, constituting an integral part of galactic pre-processing."}

After the first year of observations, LSST will extend beyond the magnitude limit of existing representative spectroscopic calibration samples, requiring photometric redshifts to be calibrated using an alternative strategy. Adopting literature measurements of the reduced redshift calibration precision found from galaxy cross-correlation techniques, combined with current levels of baryon feedback uncertainty, we forecast final year LSST cosmic shear constraints that barely improve upon the first year analysis. This forecast therefore serves as encouragement to the community to develop methodology and observations to constrain models of baryon feedback and enhance photometric redshift calibration at depths where spectroscopy is unrepresentative.

Yet direct observational evidence of the dependence of star formation activity on distance to filaments remains scarce and is missing at z>1. We investigate how starburst, main-sequence (MS), and quenched galaxies are distributed with respect to cosmic web filaments, and how this distribution evolves with redshift. We first use the SIMBA cosmological simulation to predict the redshift evolution of the mean distance to the closest filament from z=3 to z=0 for different galaxy populations after removing stellar-mass dependencies. We then measure the corresponding signal in the COSMOS field, using COSMOS2020 and COSMOS-Web data, where accurate photometric redshifts enable reconstruction of the projected cosmic web from z=2 to z=0.5, and starbursts are identified through far-infrared spectral energy distribution fitting. In agreement with the results from SIMBA, starburst galaxies are found closer to filaments at z>1 and at larger distances at z<1, MS galaxies occupy intermediate environments with little evolution, and quenched galaxies show progressively shorter distances to filaments toward low redshift, with a crossing between starburst and MS populations around z~1. In COSMOS-Web, the relative evolution in the average distance to filaments between starburst and MS galaxies is detected at a significance level of at least 5σ. We show that a minimal toy model in which the only environmental ingredient is the sSFR-filament distance modulation measured in simulations is sufficient to reproduce the observed differential evolution of the average filament distance between starburst and MS galaxies. These results show that the imprint of large-scale environmental effects on the star formation activity of galaxies, predicted by simulations, is detectable from z=2 down to z=0.5."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "Dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) actively contribute to the thermodynamics, chemistry, and radiative state of the interstellar medium (ISM), yet most ISM models and galaxy simulations either exclude them altogether or adopt simplified treatments. We present CALIMA, a new module for dust and PAH formation and evolution in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations for RAMSES, designed to self-consistently couple dust physics to radiative transfer and non-equilibrium thermochemistry in a multiphase ISM. The model employs a two-size, two-composition dust framework with log-normal grain populations, explicitly evolving stellar dust injection, turbulence-informed gas-phase accretion, shattering, coagulation, thermal and non-thermal sputtering, and shock destruction, while PAHs are separate components with their own evolution. The evolving dust populations and radiation field determine local, wavelength-dependent opacities, photoelectric heating efficiencies, grain-assisted recombination, dust-gas collisional heating/cooling, and H$_2$ formation on both grains and PAHs. Updated treatments of thermal sputtering and collisional cooling that include finite grain sizes and modern ion-solid physics reduce sputtering rates at high temperatures and extend the regime where dust significantly cools hot gas. One-zone ISM tests show that dust and PAH evolution modifies classical thermal phase diagrams and C-bearing chemistry, while isolated disc galaxy simulations reveal environment-dependent variations in dust-to-metal ratio, small-to-large grain ratio, PAH fraction, and interstellar radiation field intensity that drive non-trivial structure in infrared emission, UV transparency, and H$_2$ formation. CALIMA provides a physically motivated framework to interpret dust- and PAH-based observables and to assess dust-mediated feedback in galaxy formation across cosmic time."}

We test its viability on cosmological scales using simulations with $256^{3}$ particles in a box of size $800/h$ comoving Mpc. We find generically that the MOND models massively overproduce large-scale structures by $z=0$, with a most massive cluster in $ν$HDM of $\\approx 5 \\times 10^{17} M_{\\odot}/h$ and typical peculiar velocities of several thousand km/s. We also explore a local void solution to the Hubble tension in these models. Analogues to the observed \"Local Hole'' do form in the MOND models, but values for the deceleration parameter $<-1.5$ in these regions prevent a satisfactory resolution to the Hubble tension. Whilst $Λ$CDM significantly underpredicts the observed bulk flow in Cosmicflows-4, the high peculiar velocities that arise in the MOND models create the opposite problem, ruling out $ν$HDM at $>5σ$ confidence. Observations clearly require a much milder enhancement to the rate of structure growth in $Λ$CDM than is provided by the $ν$HDM paradigm. Our results also suggest that replacing cold dark matter with hot dark matter is unlikely to provide a viable cosmological model, regardless of the gravity law."}

In this work we provide observational evidence that magnetic fields can signal differences in the extraplanar star formation and explore what are the physical conditions that lead to the formation of a jellyfish galaxy. We first focus on JO147, a jellyfish galaxy that features weak star formation activity in its tail. Using MeerKAT radio continuum observations, we discover polarized emission only in a small fraction of its tail, with an average fraction of $~10\\%$, and a low Mach number $\\mathcal{M}=1.3-1.6$, which suggests a possible association between magnetic field draping, shock-compression of the gas, and extraplanar star formation activity. Then, we test this scenario in a sample of 17 jellyfish galaxies from the GASP project. We combine dynamical models for their orbits within the host clusters with realistic cluster temperature profiles to infer their Mach number, and we find a positive correlation between it and the star formation activity in their tail. We conclude that supersonic motion is a necessary condition for triggering star formation in the stripped tails of jellyfish galaxies. Our findings provide empirical evidence that the critical factor preventing the stripped gas evaporation is the shock compression induced by the supersonic motion through the cluster. This process likely enhances the magnetic field surrounding the galaxy and the properties of the stripped material."}

After inflation ends, the decay of the inflavon reheats the Universe, establishing a novel link between early Universe cosmology and flavor physics. As concrete examples, we present realizations where the inflavon potential is described by an $α$-attractor potential. We then compute the resulting CMB observables, specifically the spectral index ($n_s$), the tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r$), and the amplitude of scalar perturbations ($A_s$) as functions of the underlying Froggatt-Nielsen model parameters. We identify the parameter space in Froggatt-Nielsen models involving the scale of Flavor symmetry breaking $Λ_{\\rm FN}$ and FN charges which is ruled out by Planck and ACT data, as well as the region that could be probed by next-generation CMB experiments like CMB-S4, SO and LiteBIRD.

This left an open question: Are UDGs something special, or just an extension of the previously known dwarf galaxy population? Seeking to answer this question, in the decade following, dedicated simulations have studied and proposed a myriad of formation pathways to create UDGs. Observations have then pushed the limits of world-class observatories to perform detailed studies of these galaxies in large numbers across the full range of environments in the local Universe. These observations stress test simulations and challenge previous galaxy formation wisdom, with UDGs posing many open puzzles beyond just their unknown formation mechanism. To provide a few pertinent examples: there is observational evidence that not all UDGs follow the standard stellar mass -- halo mass relationship; there is evidence for UDGs with extraordinarily high levels of alpha enhancement; and there is evidence that some UDGs are much more globular cluster rich than other dwarfs of similar stellar mass. In this Dawes review, we undertake the task of summarising the decade of science since the discovery of UDGs. We focus on the quiescent population of UDGs and review their general properties, their proposed formation scenarios, their internal properties and their globular cluster systems. We also provide a brief conjecture on some future directions for the next decade of UDG research."}

In particular, uncertainties in measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN) host galaxies, combined with modeling limitations, obfuscate the impact of supermassive black hole feedback across environments and over time. Here we address this with a comprehensive analysis of ~60,000 nearby AGNs (z < 0.15 and new environment and halo-mass measurements for ~500,000 AGN and non-AGN host galaxies. This benchmark enables unified comparisons with three prominent cosmological simulations--SIMBA, TNG, and EAGLE--and reveals major, contrasting shortcomings. Simulations fail to reproduce observed trends linking star formation, quiescence, AGN luminosity, stellar mass, and halo mass. While simulations qualitatively capture that AGNs are more common in low-mass halos than in rich groups or clusters, detailed host demographics diverge strongly from observations. Partial agreement exists in the stellar mass distribution within large-scale structures, yet all simulations overproduce quenched low-mass satellites in massive halos, while misrepresenting quenched fractions of massive central galaxies and those in low-density environments, which are sensitive to feedback implementation. Improved AGN physics and modeling of multi-phase gas cooling and flows are required to capture the observed interplay between black holes, galaxies, and halos."}

We examine their star formation rates (SFRs), dust attenuation properties, and the relationship between nebular and stellar reddening. For both samples, SFRs derived from H$α$ are strongly correlated with SFRs from fitting simple star formation histories (SFHs) to the galaxies' spectral energy distributions. In fitting a joint SFR-$\\rm M_*$ relation, we obtain a slope of $\\rm {Δlog(SFR_{Hα})}/{Δlog(M_*/M_\\odot)}=1.01\\pm0.03$, indicating that fair ensembles of SFHs for galaxies at these stellar masses are well-described by scale-free, self-similar forms. We also examine their dust attenuation properties and the relationship between nebular and stellar reddening, exploring how these quantities vary with stellar mass and specific SFR (sSFR). Nebular attenuation increases with stellar mass for IMGs but is lower and less mass-dependent in LMGs, consistent with their reduced dust content. In all cases, stellar continuum attenuation is lower than nebular attenuation, as expected from the two-component dust model. The nebular-to-stellar color excess ratio in both samples is consistent with the canonical factor of 2.27. The ratio is mass-independent, but rises with sSFR in IMGs and remains constant in LMGs. These results suggest that in LMGs, efficient dispersal of birth clouds keeps the differential attenuation approximately constant across sSFR. Thus, although LMGs follow the same global SFR-$\\rm M_*$ scaling as massive galaxies, their lower dust content and feedback-maintained ISM produce distinct attenuation behavior relative to IMGs."}

We then show that if the theory is instead coupled to the Ricci tensor or the Riemann tensor, the two tensor modes become strongly coupled in addition to the transverse pseudo-vector modes. We then extend our analysis to homogeneous and isotropic space-time, with vanishing background value of the Kalb-Ramond field.

Expanding this catalogue is not only a necessity to facilitate further detailed dust studies beyond the few limited studies conducted thus far, but also to improve pair-to-pair variance and support automated identification through machine learning techniques. To achieve this, we utilise galaxies classified as \"overlapping\" from Galaxy Zoo DECaLS (GZD-1, -2, and -5), along with images from Data Release 10 (DR10) of the DESI Legacy Survey, in our individual citizen science project to classify these pairs directly using volunteers.

Comparable results are obtained when different procedures are used to match the ionized gas to its source. All samples we study contain a substantial fraction of objects (up to 20 per cent), where the stellar source is not sufficient to produce the H$α$ flux observed from the nebula. Many of them are probably related to uncertain age estimates, but we also find numerous regions, where a significant fraction of the ionizing photon budget is contributed by stars that reside outside the boundaries of the HII region.

Recent numerical simulations have suggested a diversity in the stellar-to-halo mass ratio in this halo mass range, but either the number of samples obtained from the same simulation setup or the numerical resolution was limited. We performed high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations for eight galaxies with a dark matter halo mass of $\\sim 10^9\\rm\\ M_{\\odot}$ up to $t=1.2$ Gyr at which most gas in the galaxies has been expelled. Our samples have a scatter of an order of magnitude in the halo mass at the reionization epoch. The stellar-to-halo mass ratio expected at $z=0$ scatters nearly two orders of magnitude with $5\\times10^{-5}$ to $2\\times10^{-3}$. We also observed variation in the compactness of their stellar distributions. Some of our simulated galaxies exhibit a stellar half-mass radius of $\\sim30$ pc, which is as small as that of ultra-compact dwarfs. The formation condition for such a compact stellar distribution is understood as an analog of the condition for the formation of dense, massive star clusters. We found that when the central gas surface density exceeds a critical threshold ($Σ_{\\rm gas} \\gtrsim 30\\rm\\ M_\\odot \\rm\\ {pc}^{-2}$), the star formation becomes highly efficient and results in dense stellar systems. These results suggest that UCDs can form in situ even in isolated dark matter halos."}

Using void catalogs from four Millennium Simulation snapshots and SDSS data at $z<0.04$, we perform a unified analysis of void demographics, galaxy properties, and internal kinematics. Our analysis reveals clear evidence that cosmic voids exhibit a significant evolutionary trend of becoming progressively emptier toward low redshift, accompanied by a marked decline in the brightness and clustering of their galaxy populations. The void galaxy luminosity function evolves significantly: $M^{*}$ fades and $α$ flattens with time, with large voids hosting brighter, more rapidly evolving galaxies than small voids. Stacked density profiles exhibit a universal shape when scaled by void radius, deepening and building more pronounced walls toward $z=0$. Galaxy spatial distributions reveal persistent size-dependent segregation, with galaxies in large voids lying farther from the center and more strongly clustered. Dynamical analysis of simulations shows coherent outward flows in all voids, with amplitudes decreasing toward $z=0$, providing a physical basis for observed redshift-space distortions. Comparison with SDSS broadly confirms these evolutionary trends but uncovers a non-zero central galaxy population in observed voids -- absent in $Λ$CDM predictions -- that may challenge current galaxy formation models in extreme underdensities. Future comparisons with additional simulations and deeper high-redshift surveys will provide stronger tests of $Λ$CDM in the most underdense regions."}

These measurements are consistent with those reported by the EHT Collaboration. The results are significant because we demonstrate that: (1) imaging from interferometric aperture synthesis data, especially in VLBI and most acutely in extremely sparse arrays like the EHT, remains a severely ill-posed and challenging inverse problem, yet closure invariants preserve robust morphological information that can strongly constrain structural features, and (2) more importantly, closure-invariant imaging largely avoids calibration systematics, thus providing a fundamentally independent view of spatial structure with very high angular resolution. The generative nature of GenDIReCT further allows us to sample and characterise clusters of plausible image solutions for each dataset. As a calibration-independent, generative imaging approach, GenDIReCT offers a robust and truly independent blind-imaging tool for current and future VLBI experiments."}

Their relativistic wind successively interacts with the supernova ejecta of their defunct progenitor, then with the circumstellar medium of the progenitor, and eventually with the interstellar medium. If a massive star is static with respect to its ambient medium, then its resulting circumstellar medium is elongated along the direction of the local magnetic field, and its supernova remnant transiently appears as a rectangle. The pulsar wind nebula forming in it is, in its turn, elongated, as long as the pulsar axis of rotation matches the direction of the local magnetization. In this work, we explore how the angle between the direction of the local magnetic field of the interstellar medium and the pulsar axis of rotation influences the shaping of its pulsar wind nebula with 3D MHD simulations are carried out with the PLUTO. We use those models to perform radiative transfer calculations to derive non-thermal radio emission maps of the pulsar wind nebulae. When the polar elongation of the pulsar develop, they bend in opposite directions under the effects of the cavity carved by the stellar wind and already filled by supernova ejecta. This induces a complex distribution of magnetized supernova ejecta and pulsar wind, resulting in various observable structures, appearing as rectangles, circles, or irregular oblong shapes, in the radio waveband. The angle between the direction of the pulsar rotation axis and that of the local ambient magnetization is a governing parameter for the shaping and non-thermal radio properties of the pulsar wind nebulae of static massive stars; however, the mixing of material, once the pulsar wind nebula is old (50 to 80 kyr), is not strongly affected by that factor."}

Accepted for publication in Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "A significant fraction of stars in both the Galactic field and stellar clusters are members of binary systems. Understanding their properties is therefore essential for a comprehensive view of stellar structure, evolution, and cluster dynamics. Despite extensive studies of cluster binaries, key issues remain unresolved, particularly for photometric binaries among low-mass stars. While the binary fraction in the field strongly depends on stellar mass, cluster studies have generally suggested an approximately constant fraction over the limited mass ranges explored. In addition, the mass function (MF) of very low-mass stars is still poorly constrained in clusters older than a few hundred Myr. We use deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 2158 to investigate its binary population and derive the luminosity and MFs down to ~0.14 solar masses, enabling the first detailed analysis of binaries in this cluster. We measure a global binary fraction of 38%, consistent with other open clusters, and find a clear mass dependence: it decreases from ~52% at 1.0 solar masses to ~11% at 0.2 solar masses. This trend mirrors that of Galactic field stars, suggesting similar binary properties. The MF is characterized by three regimes: high-mass stars (alpha= -2.49 +- 0.19), low-mass stars (alpha= -1.11 +- 0.09), and very low-mass stars (alpha= -0.08 +- 0.07). The slope change near 1.0 solar mass agrees with recent surveys, though we find a deficit below ~0.3 solar masses. We also detect a main-sequence discontinuity around ~0.3 solar masses, possibly linked to the 3He-driven instability predicted by stellar models and analogous to the Jao Gap seen in nearby field stars."}

Yet direct observational evidence of the dependence of star formation activity on distance to filaments remains scarce and is missing at z>1. We investigate how starburst, main-sequence (MS), and quenched galaxies are distributed with respect to cosmic web filaments, and how this distribution evolves with redshift. We first use the SIMBA cosmological simulation to predict the redshift evolution of the mean distance to the closest filament from z=3 to z=0 for different galaxy populations after removing stellar-mass dependencies. We then measure the corresponding signal in the COSMOS field, using COSMOS2020 and COSMOS-Web data, where accurate photometric redshifts enable reconstruction of the projected cosmic web from z=2 to z=0.5, and starbursts are identified through far-infrared spectral energy distribution fitting. In agreement with the results from SIMBA, starburst galaxies are found closer to filaments at z>1 and at larger distances at z<1, MS galaxies occupy intermediate environments with little evolution, and quenched galaxies show progressively shorter distances to filaments toward low redshift, with a crossing between starburst and MS populations around z~1. In COSMOS-Web, the relative evolution in the average distance to filaments between starburst and MS galaxies is detected at a significance level of at least 5σ. We show that a minimal toy model in which the only environmental ingredient is the sSFR-filament distance modulation measured in simulations is sufficient to reproduce the observed differential evolution of the average filament distance between starburst and MS galaxies. These results show that the imprint of large-scale environmental effects on the star formation activity of galaxies, predicted by simulations, is detectable from z=2 down to z=0.5."}

Variations in [alpha/Fe] are included in a self-consistent manner from the stellar interior models to the synthetic spectra used to translate these models in the observational plane. We describe a number of updates to the physics utilized in these models as well as new information provided by the models. We validate the models with comparisons to other stellar evolution models including the previous generation of MIST and other models from the literature. MIST data products including stellar evolutiont tracks, isochrones, and bolometric correction tables can be obtained from the MIST project website, https://mist.science.

Our observations detected 216 compact radio sources, of which 58 yielded reliable multi-epoch astrometric solutions. For these sources, we derived trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions with typical precisions of about 0.05 mas and 0.10 mas yr$^{-1}$, respectively. The measured parallaxes range between 2.26 and 2.65 mas, corresponding to distances of 380 - 440 pc, and delineate the depth of the Orion star-forming complex. We determine mean distances of $405\\pm16$ pc for NGC 2068, $403\\pm5$ pc for NGC 2024, $407\\pm12$ pc for the $σ$ Orionis region, $388.5\\pm1.7$ pc for the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), and $438\\pm12$ pc for L1641. A comparison with Gaia DR3 astrometry for 28 common sources reveals negligible mean parallax offsets ($Δ\\varpi=-0.02\\pm0.01$ mas) and small systematic differences in proper motions ($\\sim$0.07 mas yr$^{-1}$), likely due to residual rotation of the Gaia reference frame. Our results demonstrate the capability of high-precision radio astrometry to map embedded stellar populations and to provide an independent calibration of the Gaia reference system in obscured regions."}

At scales smaller than the ion gyroscale or frequencies exceeding the ion cyclotron frequency, the Alfvén modes transform into kinetic-Alfvén or whistler modes that significantly contribute to plasma dynamics. However, this scenario reverses in non-neutral pair plasmas, such as those found in the magnetospheres of pulsars and magnetars, around rotating black holes and in their relativistic jets, as well as in certain laboratory plasmas. In these systems, the large-scale dynamics is governed by hybrid whistler-Alfvén modes, which transform into pure Alfvén modes at smaller scales. We derive the nonlinear equations that describe the dynamics of whistler-Alfvén modes in ultrarelativistic non-neutral magnetically dominated pair plasma and discuss the spectrum of turbulence governed by these equations."}

The induced flux is consistent with the bounds on the excess flux of radio photons from ARCADE2 and EDGES measurements."}
