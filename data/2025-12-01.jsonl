Velocity-resolved [OI] 63 mu map of a peculiar proplyd-like object", "categories": ["astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "A&A in press Received: 12 September 2025 / Accepted: 03 November 2025", "summary": "We investigated an isolated, globule-shaped object (0.37x0.11 pc), located near the centre of the Cygnus OB2 cluster and named proplyd #7 in optical observations. The source can be a massive star (with or without disc) with a HII region or a G-type T Tauri star with a photo-evaporating disc, embedded in a molecular envelope. We obtained a map of the OI line at 63 micron with 6\" angular resolution and employed archival data of the CII 158 micron line (14\" resolution), using the upGREAT heterodyne receiver aboard SOFIA. We also collected IRAM 30m CO data at 1mm (11\" resolution). All the lines were detected across the whole object. The peak integrated OI emission of ~5 K km/s is located ~10\" west of an embedded YSO. The OI and CII data near the source show bulk emission at ~11 km/s and a line wing at ~13 km/s, while the 12CO 2-1 data reveal additional blue-shifted high-velocity emission. The KOSMA-tau PDR model can explain the emissions in the tail with a low external UV field (<350 Go, mostly consistent with our UV field estimates), but not at the location of the YSO. There, the high line intensities and increased line widths for all lines and a possible bipolar CO outflow suggest the presence of a protostellar disc. However, the existence of a thermal HII region, revealed by combining existing and new radio continuum data, points towards a massive star - and not a T Tauri-type one. We derived molecular and atomic gas masses of ~20 Msun and a few Msun, respectively. The photo-evaporation (only considering external illumination) lifetime of 1.6x10^5 yrs is shorter than the free-fall lifetime of 5.2x10^5 yrs; thus, we find that proplyd #7 might not have had the time to produce many more stars."}

Multiple Spiral Mode Formation via Swing Amplification", "categories": ["astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "20 pages, 12 figures, Submitted to A&A", "summary": "We investigate the formation of multiple spiral modes in Milky Way-like disk-halo systems without explicitly exciting perturbations. We explore how numerical resolution, the level of local disk stability, and the presence of a live halo influence both the initial appearance and the subsequent evolution of these modes. To characterize spiral structure, we compute Fourier amplitudes for modes $m=1$-$6$. In marginally unstable, lower-resolution disks ($N_\\star=5\\times10^6$, $N_{\\rm DM}=1.14\\times10^7$), faint features appear within the first $0.5$ Gyr due to numerical noise, in contrast to high-resolution models where perturbations emerge later. Across all sufficiently resolved, live-halo models with $m_{\\rm DM}/m_\\star \\le 10$, the spirals exhibit a cascading sequence in both mode number and radius: higher-$m$ modes form and decay first, followed by the delayed emergence of lower-$m$ modes, with an inward drift of the activity's epicenter. This behavior reflects a combination of local swing amplification, which explains the initial growth of short-wavelength modes, and interference between coexisting long-lived spiral modes, which accounts for the recurrent short-timescale amplitude modulations. In contrast, models with a fixed halo potential or coarse halo resolution ($N_{\\rm DM}=1.14\\times10^6$ and $m_{\\rm DM}/m_\\star=100$) show strong early spirals but lack this coherent cascading behavior, owing to excessive shot noise and insufficient halo responsiveness. The $m=3$ mode plays a transitional role, marking the onset of angular-momentum transport in the inner disk that precedes bar formation, a process absent in fixed-potential models. Our results show that a live halo with appropriate mass resolution provides the gravitational response needed to sustain and regenerate multi-mode spiral structure, even though the total angular-momentum exchange remains small."}

Yet, studies of Cl-bearing molecules have remained limited to a few sightlines due to observational challenges.\n  We systematically investigated the Galactic distribution of HCl and the [H$^{35}$Cl]/[H$^{37}$Cl] ratio in high-mass star-forming regions. As a probe of a region's nucleosynthesis history, this ratio may constrain predictions of Galactic chemical evolution models.\n  We observed the ground-state $J=1$$-$0 lines of H$^{35}$Cl and H$^{37}$Cl toward 28 high-mass star-forming regions with SEPIA660 on APEX, more than doubling the number of known HCl detections and revealing with XCLASS models emission from both cores and outflows.\n  H$^{35}$Cl was detected in all sources, H$^{37}$Cl in all but two, with spectral line profiles ranging from those with only emission to complex emission-absorption mixtures. We find column densities of the order of $10^{13}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ for H$^{35}$Cl and isotopic ratios between $1.6$ and $3.5$ in emission-only sources.\n  The derived [H$^{35}$Cl]/[H$^{37}$Cl] aligns with Galactic chemical evolution models and shows no trend with Galactocentric radius. However, local variations may reflect recent nucleosynthesis. Overall, the results suggest that most Galactic chlorine was synthesized during epochs of lower average metallicity in the Galaxy. Notably, we detect H$^{35}$Cl emission arising from outflows - particularly explosive ones - hinting at its presence in a broader range of environments. The present single-dish observations cannot reveal the origin of HCl in outflows; necessitating interferometric follow-up observations."}

We investigate the prevalence of such cold streams in IllustrisTNG-50 over the range z=4-0, using a novel algorithm to automatically detect cold streams in simulated halos. We qualitatively and quantitatively characterize the geometric and physical properties of the detected streams over cosmic time. We find that cold streams are ubiquitous in massive halos at cosmic noon, occurring in more than 80 percent of such systems down to z=1, before becoming rare by z=0. At their peak prevalence (z=2-1), streams are often found in roughly co-planar, three-stream configurations. These streams generally exhibit a dense and cool core, surrounded by a diffuse and warmer envelope. However, we find that in IllustrisTNG-50, these streams typically disrupt in the outer halo and do not penetrate efficiently to the central galaxy, with the total mass inflow from streams peaking at z=2. Our results underscore the importance of cold streams in fueling galaxies at early times, but they highlight the need for higher-resolution simulations to fully capture their survival and impact at later epochs. Future cosmological zoom-in simulations, with better resolution in the CGM, will be essential to resolve turbulent mixing layers and feedback-inflow interactions that determine whether cold streams can reach the galactic disk."}

We investigate the cosmological evolution and optical appearance of black holes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity coupled with Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy (KHDE). Utilizing Cosmic Chronometers (CC) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) datasets, we constrain model parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis. Results indicate that the late-time universe statistically favors a phantom-like equation of state ($c \\approx 0.704$). Regarding the EGB coupling $α$, although data favor a positive value, the parameter space permits negative values down to a theoretical stability cut-off at $α\\approx -0.03$. While the best-fit suggests deviation, results remain consistent with General Relativity ($α=0$) within the $2σ$ confidence level. Based on these constraints, we model the secular mass accretion history (treating accretion efficiency as a phenomenological constant) and compute the shadow radius evolution. We find that in a realistic dispersive plasma environment, refractive effects significantly mask intrinsic gravitational and dark energy signatures, causing global shadow shrinkage. Nevertheless, a characteristic systematic intrinsic deviation of $\\sim 1\\%$--$1.5\\%$ (under a conservative accretion scenario) persists at redshifts $z \\lesssim 1.5$ relative to standard $Λ$CDM predictions. These findings suggest that despite environmental dominance, precise statistical analyses of shadow populations could disentangle these subtle dynamic dark energy signals from the standard cosmological paradigm."}

The B4R receiver was developed based on the dual-polarization sideband-separating mixer technology of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and is equipped with a fast Fourier transform digital spectrometer, XFFTS. The primary science objective is the spectroscopic redshift identification of high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies, complementing the existing 3 mm Redshift Search Receiver by enabling the detection of multiple carbon monoxide lines. Additionally, the B4R receiver broadens the range of science cases possible with the LMT, including astrochemistry, as the 2 mm band encompasses unique molecular lines such as deuterated molecules and shock tracers. During on-site commissioning in 2018 and 2019, we successfully demonstrated on-the-fly mapping and position-switching observations toward the Orion Molecular Cloud 1 and bright high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies, respectively. We confirmed that the installed B4R system largely met its basic performance specifications. Furthermore, we measured the LMT's aperture efficiencies across the entire B4R frequency range (130-160 GHz), finding them to be roughly consistent with expectations based on a surface accuracy of 100 $μ$m and the receiver optics design. These results with the B4R will enable the most sensitive single-dish spectroscopic observations at 2 mm using the LMT."}

We show that LRD continuum spectra are ubiquitously well described by modified blackbodies across ~$0.4-1.0μ$m, with typical T~5000K or $λ_{peak}$~$0.65μ$m across 2 dex in luminosity, and a tail toward T~2000K. LRDs therefore trace a locus in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram that is directly analogous to stars on the Hayashi track, strongly supporting the picture that LRDs are AGN embedded in thermalised dense gas envelopes in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium. Hotter LRDs with $λ_{peak}<0.65μ$m typically have strong Balmer breaks, redder UV slopes and high optical luminosities; other LRDs show weak or no Balmer breaks, and wide variety in $β_{UV}$ and $L_{5100}$. Crucially, we demonstrate that the UV-optical continuum shapes and luminosities are strongly linked to the $Hα,\\ Hβ$, [OIII] and OI line properties. There is a tight linear relation between the H$α$ and optical continuum luminosities, as well as H$α$ and OI$_{8446}$, indicating that Balmer, OI and optical emission must primarily be powered by the same source. The Balmer decrement increases strongly toward higher $L_{Hα}$, $L_{5100}$ and Balmer break strength, providing key evidence for luminosity-dependent effects of collisional (de-)excitation and resonant scattering in the gaseous envelopes. In contrast, we show that [OIII] emission likely originates from star-forming host galaxies, and that its strong correlation with Balmer break strength arises naturally from variation in the AGN-to-host ratio. Our work presents an empirical description of the nature and structure of LRDs, defining a new benchmark for ongoing LRD model developments."}

The dependence on $σ_8$ vanishes when projected correlation functions $w_{m+}$ are normalized by matter density correlations $w_{mm}$, consistent with predictions from linear alignment models.

Moreover, examining orientation-only correlation functions from ellipticity-normalized galaxies $\\tilde w_{m+}$, we confirm that alignment signals retain sensitivity to supernova feedback across full, star forming, quiescent, and ellipticity-normalized samples.

To obtain reliable emission-line fluxes from narrow-band photometry, we employed spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting using CIGALE, a robust tool that reconstructs the continuum emission and ensures accurate flux measurements. This method effectively mitigates uncertainties associated with direct continuum subtraction techniques, and systematics such as absorption components in the emission lines. We validate our approach using simulated observations of galaxy spectra with added noise, testing the method's performance across different equivalent width (EW) regimes and emission-line strengths. Additionally, we compare the recovered emission-line fluxes with spectroscopic measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).

The smoking-gun signature for these exotic objects is the emergence of caustics, which form when the lens radius is below a critical threshold. Crossing these caustics induces discontinuous jumps in the images-centroid trajectory, a distinctive feature of these extended dark objects. We show these patterns are sensitive to the internal mass profile, with boson stars generating larger, more prominent caustic structures than Q-balls -- enabling the models to be distinguished.

In this work, we combine internally reconstructed CMB lensing maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 with galaxy samples from unWISE and a map of the cosmic infrared background (CIB) fluctuations from Planck to produce a well-correlated tracer of the CMB lensing field. Our co-added tracer, shown to be 55-85% correlated with the true lensing convergence at multipoles $L \\leq 2000$, is then convolved with ACT DR6 $E$-mode polarization to yield a template of the lensing $B$-modes. We assess its performance on a wide range of scales by using it to delens ACT DR6 and Planck $B$-modes over 23% of the sky, removing around 39% of the lensing power at $100\\leq l \\leq 1500$ and 47% at $30 \\leq l \\leq 300$, respectively.

The primary objective of this study is to elucidate the capabilities of our pipeline in the context of recovering the intrinsic profiles and associated parameters, such as dispersion measure, frequency scaling index, scattering time, pulse broadening function, and time of arrival residuals. We use simulated profiles to rigorously test and validate the efficiency of our recovery pipeline. These simulated profiles encompass single and multi-component Gaussians, designed to emulate the diverse nature of pulsar profiles. By comparing the recovered profiles and parameters to their injected values, as derived from simulations, we provide a robust evaluation of the pipeline's performance along with its drawbacks and limitations."}

We explore two prescriptions for the high-redshift ($z>7$) Lyman-Werner background (LWB), differing in intensity and redshift evolution. Star formation begins early ($z\\gtrsim8$) in progenitors with $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}\\sim10^5$-$10^6 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, where molecular hydrogen enables warm moderate-density gas to efficiently cool. The LWB strongly influences the $z=0$ halo occupation fraction, shifting the dark-to-luminous transition from $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}\\sim10^7 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ (weaker LWB) to $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}\\sim10^8 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ (stronger LWB). Galaxies with $M_\\ast\\gtrsim10^5 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ are mostly insensitive to the LWB choice, whereas lower mass systems respond strongly, producing markedly different stellar mass-halo mass (SMHM) relations. The weaker LWB yields a very shallow SMHM slope with nearly constant scatter, while the stronger LWB introduces a pronounced break at $M_{\\mathrm{200c}}\\sim10^9 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$, where haloes of similar mass host galaxies with $M_\\ast\\sim10^3$ to $10^5 \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ or remain dark.

While all PTA collaborations around the world use Fourier-domain Gaussian processes to model the GWB and intrinsic long time-correlated (red) noise, techniques to model the time-correlated radio frequency-dependent (chromatic) processes have varied from collaboration to collaboration. Here we test a new class of models for PTA data, Gaussian processes based on time-domain kernels that model the statistics of the chromatic processes starting from the covariance matrix. As we will show, these models can be effectively equivalent to Fourier-domain models in mitigating chromatic noise. This work presents a method for Bayesian model selection across the various choices of kernel as well as deterministic chromatic models for non-stationary chromatic events and the solar wind. As PTAs turn towards high frequency (>1/yr) sensitivity, the size of the basis used to model these processes will need to increase, and these time-domain models present some computational efficiencies compared to Fourier-domain models."}

To prove the capabilities of mapping and spectral scans with the B4R on the LMT, commissioning observations were conducted employing the on-the-fly mapping technique toward Orion-KL/OMC-1, which covers a map size of 5$'\\times$5$'$. These mapping observations were performed with two frequency settings providing 10 GHz in total (131.4-133.9 GHz and 145.1-147.6 GHz; 136.2-138.7 GHz and 149.9-152.4 GHz) with a frequency resolution of 76.293 kHz. We conducted spectral line identification analysis for the hot core and compact ridge regions in the Orion-KL with a beam size of 11-12$''$. We detected nearly 400 emission lines and identified two recombination lines and 29 molecular species, including isotopologues, deuterated molecules, and vibrational excited states, despite the short integration time. These results are consistent with those of previous studies. The 29 molecular species include nitrogen (N)-bearing complex organic molecules (COMs) and oxygen (O)-bearing COMs. To demonstrate the capability of the B4R in astrochemistry, we conducted detailed analyses of column densities, rotational temperatures, and relative abundances with respect to H$_2$ on two representative COMs, N-bearing C$_2$H$_5$CN and O-bearing CH$_3$OCHO in the central 40$''\\times$40$''$ area of the map. The wide bandwidth of 10 GHz enabled the use of 8 and 34 emission lines, respectively. The spatial differences in the physical and chemical properties between these molecules were derived at a spatial resolution of $\\sim$12$''$. The B4R on the LMT was successfully demonstrated to be powerful for mapping and spectral scans and to have high potential for the study of interstellar chemistry."}

We report the first detailed analysis of the giant radio halo in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 2163, using upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and Very Large Array (VLA) observations. Combining radio data (300-1400 MHz) with archival X-ray data offers a unique opportunity to study the complex ICM physics of the cluster. The sensitive uGMRT observations map the halo emission for the first time out to an extent of ~3.3 Mpc, up to $r_{500}$, and also effectively recover other diffuse sources. The radio surface brightness profile is well fitted with an exponential function up to r$_{500}$, with an evolution of e-folding radius over frequencies (larger at low frequencies). The spatially resolved spectral index map reveals fluctuations and outward radial steepening of the average spectral index. Radio and X-ray surface brightness are well correlated, with a correlation slope of $\\sim$0.70 for the halo, and $\\sim$0.40 for the ridge. The correlation slope varies from cluster centre to outskirts, suggesting the magnetic field and thermal gas density scaling relation (B $\\propto n_{e}^{0.5}$) should be reassessed, provided that the re-acceleration efficiency is constant. We propose that diffuse lobes at the periphery could serve as a reservoir for seed electrons, behind the radio halo emission, with an estimated acceleration efficiency reaching $\\sim$0.1% in the external regions. Additionally, a major E-W merger is suggested, leading to turbulence in the ICM and generating the halo."}

Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will enable astronomers to discover rare and distant astrophysical transients. Host-galaxy association is crucial for selecting the most scientifically interesting transients for follow-up. LSST Deep Drilling Field observations will detect distant transients occurring in galaxies below the detection limits of most all-sky catalogues. Here we investigate the use of pre-existing smaller-scale, field-specific catalogues for host identification in the Deep Drilling Fields (DDFs) and a ranking of their usefulness. We have compiled a database of 70 deep catalogues that overlap with the Rubin DDFs and constructed thin catalogues to be homogenised and combined for transient-host matching. A systematic ranking of their utility is discussed and applied based on the inclusion of information such as spectroscopic redshifts and morphological information. Utilising this data against a Dark Energy Survey (DES) sample of supernovae with pre-identified hosts in the XMM-LSS and ECDFS fields, we evaluate different methods for transient-host association in terms of both accuracy and processing speed. We also apply light data-cleaning techniques to identify and remove contaminants within our associations, such as diffraction spikes and blended galaxies where the correct host cannot be determined with confidence. We use a lightweight machine learning approach in the form of extreme gradient boosting to generate confidence scores in our contaminant selections and associated metrics. Finally, we discuss the computational expense of implementation within the LSST transient alert brokers, which will require efficient, fast-paced processing to handle the large stream of survey data."}

Dust temperatures ($T_{d}$) are determined based on the corresponding galaxy dust masses, independently calculated in our previous work, through a self-consistent method, without the need to actually perform a complete spectral energy distribution (SED) fit of the cold dust emission fluxes. The range and average dust temperatures are found to be consistent within errors with values from other studies. Simultaneously, the dust emissivity indices ($β_{d}$) are determined, and their evolution with temperature quantified, with the $T_{d}$ anti-correlation still being present. It is investigated whether $β_{d}$ can be predicted from other relation or if it scales with other integrated dust / ISM or galaxy property, which could be used as a proxy. In this respect, new and established relations between $T_{d}$, $β_{d}$, the dust surface density and global / integrated galaxy and star-formation related quantities are presented and analysed. We find that SFR, sSFR or $Σ_{SFR}$ are inconclusive traces of the dust temperature. We also find that the extent of dust emission distribution is slightly lower on average, but comparable with the optical stellar continuum emission one. The results and conclusions can be relevant for larger scales studies of low to mid-redshift galaxies from the latest surveys."}

This classification of singular points where both Stokes parameters $Q$ and $U$ vanish stems from the fact that linear polarization is described by a second-rank tensor. By varying the number of spherical harmonics included in the polarization maps, one can probe the statistics of these singularities across a range of angular scales. Applying this method to Planck data we find clear evidence of non-Gaussianity in both $E$ and $B$ modes of polarization. This approach may be especially useful for processing data from current and future experiments such as the Simons Observatory (SO). In particular, it can help to assess the Gaussianity of a potentially detected B mode signal, thereby determining whether it arises from primordial tensor perturbations -- as predicted by inflation -- or from alternative sources such as polarized foregrounds (e.g., thermal dust), E-to-B mode leakage, systematics, photon noise or gravitational lensing. We have made publicly available software that finds\n  unpolarized points of all three types on any polarization map in\n  Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelation (HEALPix) format with full or incomplete sky coverage\n  to enable testing of the observed signal for Gaussianity."}

To study these dynamics, we require high-resolution, photometrically calibrated observations. Over the last 9 years, the Juno spacecraft's optical camera, JunoCam, has generated a unique dataset with high spatial resolution, wide coverage during perijove passes, and a long baseline. However, JunoCam lacks absolute photometric calibration, hindering quantitative analysis of the Jovian atmosphere. Using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as a proxy for a calibrated sensor, we present a novel method for performing unpaired image-to-image translation (I2I) between JunoCam and HST, focusing on addressing the resolution discrepancy between the two sensors. Our structure-preserving I2I method, SP-I2I, incorporates explicit frequency-space constraints designed to preserve high-frequency features ensuring the retention of fine, small-scale spatial structures - essential for studying Jupiter's atmosphere. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art unpaired image-to-image translation methods are inadequate to address this problem, and, importantly, we show the broader impact of our proposed solution on relevant remote sensing data for the pansharpening task."}

In this context, UNIONS enables the selection of $u$-dropout high-redshift Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBGs). We perform a MCMC-based forecast to estimate the uncertainties on $f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc}$ and on a galaxy bias parameter, which captures our uncertainty in the tracer bias. From the angular cross-power spectrum between LBGs and Planck CMB lensing, we forecast $σ(f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc})=34$ for an idealized photometric sample of $r<24.3$ LBGs selected with a Random Forest classification algorithm from UNIONS-like $ugriz$ imaging, with a resulting surface density of $1,100$ deg$^{-2}$.

We test a more realistic $u$-dropout LBG selection using early UNIONS data, which yields a denser sample of $r<24.2$ objects at $1,400$ deg$^{-2}$. From this sample, covering a larger footprint and expected to have a higher large-scale galaxy bias, we forecast $σ(f_{\\rm NL}^{\\rm loc})=20$, with similar precision achievable after DESI spectroscopic follow-up. In addition, we perform preliminary validation of the redshift distribution using the clustering-redshift method with DESI DR1 data, confirming the calibration from deep, small-area photometric fields.

This study provides a proof of concept for extracting the spatially resolved SFHs of local galaxies with Euclid, highlighting the strengths and limitations of SFH modeling in the context of next-generation galaxy surveys. We used the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code Prospector to model both spatially resolved and global SFHs using parametric and nonparametric configurations. The input consisted of mock ultraviolet--near-infrared photometry derived from the TNG50 cosmological simulation and processed with the radiative transfer code SKIRT. We show that nonparametric SFHs provide a more effective approach to mitigating the outshining effect by recent star formation, offering improved accuracy in the determination of galaxy stellar properties. Also, we find that the nonparametric SFH model at resolved scales closely recovers the stellar mass formation times (within 0.1~dex) and the ground truth values from TNG50, with an absolute average bias of $0.03$~dex in stellar mass and $0.01$~dex in both specific star formation rate and mass-weighted age. In contrast, larger offsets are estimated for all stellar properties and formation times when using a simple $τ$-model SFH, at both resolved and global scales, highlighting its limitations. These results emphasize the critical role of nonparametric SFHs in both global and spatially resolved analyses, as they better capture the complex evolutionary pathways of galaxies and avoid the biases inherent in simple parametric models."}

Linking the kSZ power spectrum to the properties of ionising sources would provide an opportunity to use such observations to access astrophysical and cosmological information from the Epoch of Reionisation, including the morphology of ionised regions, while simultaneously improving CMB analyses. The aim of this work is to assess this potential of the kSZ power spectrum to measure reionisation-era galaxy properties. We repurpose the publicly available LoReLi II simulations, which track the evolution of neutral hydrogen during reionisation, to generate a training set of patchy kSZ angular power spectra. We then train an emulator using neural network regression in order to allow for efficient Bayesian inference, and conduct forecasts assuming mock observations from current and future CMB experiments. We find that measurements of the kSZ power spectrum from such surveys can provide meaningful constraints on several of the astrophysical model parameters of the LoReLi II suite, including the ionising escape fraction for which we expect a 14% relative error, on average. They also provide an independent measurement of the CMB optical depth, marginalised over the astrophysics and with error bars competitive with the cosmic variance limit from large scale surveys. The kSZ power spectrum offers a promising avenue for probing the properties of reionisation-era galaxies and providing an independent measurement of the CMB optical depth with upcoming CMB experiments. Since the error budget of our mock observations is dominated by emulator reconstruction errors, we expect our results could be further improved with a more extended simulation training set."}

We find that the mean star formation rate of quasar host galaxies has increased over the past 100 Myr by a factor of 2--3, but these galaxies were star-forming at all times previously. Our data are more consistent with quasar activity originating together with an increase in the star formation rate of otherwise normal galaxies, similar to episodic star formation in normal spirals.

We aim to understand the relationship between the power of AGN feedback and the cooling of gas in the centres of galaxy clusters by correlating the radio properties of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with the X-ray properties of their host clusters. We used catalogues from the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) along with ASKAP radio data. In total, we identified 134 radio sources associated with BCGs of the 151 eRASS1 clusters located in the PS1, PS2, and SWAG-X ASKAP fields. Non-detections were treated as upper limits. We correlated BCG radio luminosity, largest linear size (LLS), and BCG offset with the integrated X-ray luminosity of their host clusters. To characterise cool cores (CCs) and non-cool cores (NCCs), we used the concentration parameter $c_{R_{500}}$ and combined it with the BCG offset to assess cluster dynamical state. We analysed the correlation between radio mechanical power and X-ray luminosity within the CC subsample. We observe a potential positive trend between LLS and BCG offset, suggesting an environmental effect on radio-source morphology. We find a weak trend where more luminous central radio galaxies are found in clusters with higher X-ray luminosity. Within the CC subsample, there is a positive but highly scattered relationship between the mechanical luminosity of AGN jets and the X-ray cooling luminosity. This finding is supported by bootstrap resampling and flux-flux analyses. The correlation indicates that AGN feedback is ineffective in high-luminosity (high-mass) clusters. At a cooling luminosity of $L_{\\mathrm{X},~r<R_\\mathrm{cool}}\\approx 5.50\\times10^{43}$ erg/s, on average, AGN feedback appears to contribute only about 13%-22% of the energy needed to offset the radiative losses in the ICM."}

Classical trans-dimensional Bayesian methods such as Reversible Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) provide asymptotically exact inference but can be computationally expensive. Instead, modern deep learning provides a faster alternative to inference but typically assume fixed component counts, sidestepping the core challenge of trans-dimensionality. To address this, we introduce SlotFlow, a deep learning architecture for trans-dimensional amortized inference. The architecture processes time-series observations, which we represent jointly in the frequency and time domains through parallel encoders. A classifier produces a distribution over component counts K, and its MAP estimate specifies the number of slots instantiated. Each slot is parameterized by a shared conditional normalizing flow trained via permutation-invariant Hungarian matching. On sinusoidal decomposition with up to 10 overlapping components and Gaussian noise, SlotFlow achieves 99.85% cardinality accuracy and well-calibrated parameter posteriors, with systematic biases well below one posterior standard deviation. Direct comparison with RJMCMC shows close agreement in amplitude and phase, with Wasserstein distances $W_2 < 0.01$ and $< 0.03$, indicating that shared global context captures inter-component structure despite a factorized posterior. Frequency posteriors remain centered but exhibit 2-3x broader intervals, consistent with an encoder bottleneck in retaining long-baseline phase coherence. The method delivers a $\\sim 10^6\\times$ speedup over RJMCMC, suggesting applicability to time-critical workflows in gravitational-wave astronomy, neural spike sorting, and object-centric vision."}

Within the PPF description, the sound speed remains unconstrained for $w$CDM, while for the $w_0w_a$CDM case we obtain $\\log_{10} c_s^2 = -3.00^{+2.9}_{-0.99}$. Additionally, in the EFT framework, both models favor a small sound speed, with a mean value $c_s^2 \\simeq 0.3$--$0.4$ but with significant uncertainties. For dynamical dark energy, the reconstructed equation of state clearly exhibits a quintom-B behavior, and its deviation from $Λ$CDM reaches $3.42σ$, rising to $3.63σ$ when PPF perturbations are included and reducing to $3.19σ$ in the EFT case. Finally, model comparison using information criteria shows that the $w_0w_a$CDM model with a smooth, non-clustering dark energy component ($c_s^2 = 1$) is preferred by AIC, whereas BIC favors $Λ$CDM. In summary, current data indicate a mild preference for dynamical dark energy but no evidence for significant clustering, which implies the need for future high-precision observations to probe the perturbative behavior more definitively."}

We present a homogeneous, NLTE spectroscopic analysis of 401 Galactic CCs, based on 1,351 high-resolution optical spectra, spanning Galactocentric distances from 4.6 to 29.3 kpc. Using PySME with MARCS atmospheres and state-of-the-art grids of NLTE departure coefficients, we derive atmospheric parameters and abundances for key species tracing multiple nucleosynthetic channels. Our sample-the largest CC NLTE dataset to date-achieves high internal precision and enables robust modeling of present-day thin-disk abundance patterns and radial gradients. We estimate abundance gradients using three analytic prescriptions (linear, logarithmic, bilinear with a break) within a Bayesian, outlier-robust framework, and we also apply Gaussian Process Regression to capture non-parametric variations. We find that NLTE atmospheric parameters differ systematically from LTE determinations. Moreover, iron and most elemental abundance profiles are better described by non-linear behavior rather than by single-slope linear models: logarithmic fits generally outperform simple linear models, while bilinear fits yield inconsistent break radii across elements. Gaussian Process models reveal a consistent outer-disk flattening of [X/H] for nearly all studied elements. The [X/Fe] ratios are largely flat with Galactocentric radius, indicating coherent chemical scaling with iron across the thin disk, with modest positive offsets for Na and Al and mild declines for Mn and Cu. Comparison with recent literature shows overall agreement but highlights NLTE-driven differences, especially in outer-disk abundances. These results provide tighter empirical constraints for chemo-dynamical models of the Milky Way and set the stage for future NLTE mapping with upcoming large spectroscopic surveys."}

In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of six representative DDE parametrization models by utilizing the latest and most precise CMB data jointly from ACT, SPT, and Planck, in conjunction with BAO data from DESI DR2 and SN data from DESY5, PantheonPlus, and Union3. Our overall analysis indicates that the preference for DDE in the Quintom-B regime remains robust, regardless of the DDE parameterization model and the data combination employed. The trend of this preference is significantly strengthened with the support of DESY5 SN data. Specifically, when using the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data, for the Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.785 \\pm 0.047$ and $w_a = -0.43^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, which significantly deviate from the $Λ$CDM values and provide evidence for DDE at the $4.2σ$ level. By the reconstruction of the dark energy equation of state $w(z)$, normalized dark energy density $f_{\\mathrm{DE}}(z)$, and the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, we also observe clear departures from $Λ$CDM, further reinforcing the case for DDE. Furthermore, the Bayesian evidence analysis indicates that the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, BA and Exponential models are moderately favored relative to $Λ$CDM based on the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data."}

Mixed N-S-O species such as thionylimide (HNSO) are particularly relevant, as they incorporate three key biogenic elements. The $cis$ conformer of HNSO has recently been detected in the Galactic Center cloud G+0.693-0.027, but no high-resolution data for the higher energy conformer ($trans$-HNSO) had been available until now. We report the first laboratory detection and rotational spectroscopic characterization of $trans$-HNSO. Spectra were recorded with the Center for Astrochemical Studies Absorption Cell (CASAC) free-space spectrometer employing a hollow-cathode discharge source, yielding 104 assigned transitions between 200 and 530 GHz. A Watson S-reduced Hamiltonian fit reproduced the data with an rms of 40 kHz, providing accurate rotational and centrifugal distortion constants in excellent agreement with CCSD(T) predictions. Although $trans$-HNSO lies only a few kcal/mol above the $cis$ form, it has larger dipole components, making its lines particularly intense (more than 5 times brighter, assuming equal abundances) and a very promising candidate for future astronomical detection. The new measurements enable reliable frequency predictions for astronomical searches and will be added to public databases. Combined with recent evidence for tunneling-driven $trans$-to-$cis$ isomerization at cryogenic temperatures, these results open the way to test directly whether quantum tunneling governs the interstellar distribution of HNSO isomers."}

The case $N=2$ is investigated in detail and a fit to cosmological data is performed where it is found that a better fit is obtained in comparison with the $N=1$ case. The fits also constrain high scale parameters, i.e., the axion decay constant which is determined to be sub-Planckian, a result consistent with string theory that disfavors trans-Planckian axion decay constant. Furthermore, the dark energy-dark matter interaction strength is constrained to be feeble, i.e., $λ\\lesssim 4\\times 10^{-6}$ m$_{\\rm Pl}^{-2}$ Mpc$^{-2}$. We study possible implications of this type of potential on the Hubble tension and on the dynamics of the dark energy equation of state using the DESI-DR2 data.

Existing production codes require specialized HPC infrastructure and compilation expertise, limiting participation to well-resourced institutions. GANDALF addresses this barrier by leveraging JAX's hardware abstraction to run transparently on laptops, desktop GPUs, and Apple Silicon without modification, enabling single-command installation via pip. We employ Fourier spectral methods for spatial discretization and Hermite spectral basis for velocity space, combined with an exponential integrating factor method that exactly propagates linear Alfvén waves, eliminating associated numerical stiffness. Verification demonstrates research-grade accuracy: linear Alfvén waves achieve machine precision (~10^{-15} relative error), the Orszag-Tang vortex conserves energy to 10^{-6} over two Alfvén times, and driven turbulence reproduces the expected k_perp^{-5/3} cascade spectrum. GANDALF enables rapid prototyping, parameter surveys, and educational applications on commodity hardware. The code complements rather than replaces established solvers like AstroGK and Viriato, prioritizing accessibility for researchers without HPC resources. By removing infrastructure barriers while maintaining spectral accuracy, GANDALF broadens participation in fundamental plasma turbulence research, particularly benefiting students, small research groups, and institutions in developing regions."}

In addition to the supermassive black hole Sgr A*, the inner parsec of our Galactic center is home to numerous fruitful scientific habitats. One of these environments is the S cluster, which consists of two distinct populations: the main-sequence S stars and the dusty G objects. While the majority of the brightest S stars can be classified as young B stars, the G sources can be described as dusty objects whose nature is still under debate. Aims. In this work, we focus on the most prominent G objects in the S cluster and follow their Keplerian trajectory around Sgr A*. With this, we test the predictions based on almost two decades of monitoring of the direct vicinity of our central supermassive black hole using NACO and SINFONI, formerly mounted at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The goal is to increase the existing data baseline for G2/DSO, D9, and X7 to get insights into their evolution on their Keplerian trajectories. In addition, we revisit the massive Young Stellar Object (YSO) X3 and scrutinize the potential impact of its environment on this highly dynamic source. Methods. The successor to the two instruments is called ERIS and offers upgraded optics and improved properties, including an enhanced spectral resolution. We utilize the IFU mode of ERIS, called SPIFFIER. We search for the Doppler-shifted Brγ emission line to rediscover peculiar objects in the S cluster using SPIFFIER with the highest available spatial plate scale of 12.5 mas. Furthermore, we will derive the Brγ luminosity of G2/DSO to inspect the degree of its change more than ten years after the pericenter passage.

This makes it crucial to deeply understand the behaviour of our analysis pipelines. A counterintuitive feature of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) second data release is that restricting the dataset to the last 10.3 years (DR2new) increases the inferred GWB significance from $\\leq2σ$ for the full 25-year dataset (DR2full) to $\\geq3.5σ$. We investigate whether this behaviour indicates an anomaly or is a possible outcome of the pipeline. Using realistic, DR2-like simulations with varying timespans, we find that the first 10 years contribute little to the GWB evidence due to their limited frequency coverage. This produces substantial overlap between the HD S/N distributions of DR2full and DR2new. Random noise fluctuations therefore yield a higher GWB evidence in DR2new than in DR2full in $15\\%$ of cases. Furthermore, $5\\%$ of simulations match the HD S/N of the real data, indicating that the observed behaviour is consistent with being a $\\sim2σ$ outcome due to noise fluctuations. Regardless of significance, DR2new simulations introduce biases in the GWB parameter estimation due to spectral leakage effects that are ignored in standard analyses and which flatten the inferred spectrum. Including leakage removes these biases, demonstrating the reliability of DR2new when the signal is properly modelled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining EPTA DR2full with long-baseline data from NANOGrav and PPTA, as well as low-frequency data from LOFAR and NenuFAR, significantly enhances GWB evidence and parameter accuracy. Finally, we examine the impact of the observation timespan and find that short-baseline datasets introduce strong amplitude biases and are ineffective at constraining the GWB."}

A key goal going forward is to understand the diversity of NS-NS merger remnants, and how such diversity maps onto their viability as gamma-ray burst (GRB) central engines. Here, we present a study aimed at assessing the sensitivity of triggered searches for intermediate-duration, post-merger GWs powered by long-lived GRB remnants using networks of current and future ground-based GW detectors and the Cross-Correlation Algorithm (CoCoA). We develop a Python-based framework to efficiently estimate CoCoA distance horizons for a broad range of post merger secular bar-mode waveforms and for different GW detector networks.

We apply the data-driven approach proposed by Posti (2022) to include the characteristic amplitude and scale length of such correlations as `nuisance parameters'. We construct mass models for $134$ galaxies from the SPARC rotation curve compilation with Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and pseudo-isothermal sphere (pISO) models for the dark halo. Allowing for correlations in the rotation curves generally improves the goodness of fit for both halo models, often yielding a formally good fit ($χ^2_\\mathrm{r}\\approx 1$) and model uncertainties that seem more representative of the constraining power of the data. For both halo models the inference on the typical correlation amplitude and scale length are very similar and physically plausible, $\\sim 20\\,\\mathrm{km}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\\sim 5\\,\\mathrm{kpc}$, respectively. The parametric form that we use to describe the correlations is intentionally simple, and our fitting approach makes the parameters describing possible correlations prone to `absorbing' other systematic errors, so we regard these estimates as upper limits. Without allowing for correlations we find a statistical preference for the pISO over the NFW model for $88$/$134$ galaxies; this preference essentially disappears when correlations are allowed for. Accounting for correlations in rotation curves when constructing mass models fundamentally affects how they are interpreted, highlighting an important systematic uncertainty that affects evidence for cusps or cores in dark matter haloes."}

We test our method on 400 E and B polarization simulations based on the LiteBIRD experiment, containing the two main sources of contamination for CMB polarization experiments: polarized dust and synchrotron emission.

By varying the number of spherical harmonics included in the polarization maps, one can probe the statistics of these singularities across a range of angular scales. Applying this method to Planck data we find clear evidence of non-Gaussianity in both $E$ and $B$ modes of polarization. This approach may be especially useful for processing data from current and future experiments such as the Simons Observatory (SO). In particular, it can help to assess the Gaussianity of a potentially detected B mode signal, thereby determining whether it arises from primordial tensor perturbations -- as predicted by inflation -- or from alternative sources such as polarized foregrounds (e.g., thermal dust), E-to-B mode leakage, systematics, photon noise or gravitational lensing.

Although our simulations can reproduce the high log(N/O) values (up to -0.61, exceeding the solar value by 0.25 dex), they remain below the observational lower limits of GN-z11, indicating room for improvement through additional chemical evolution channels, such as supermassive stars."}

Cross-correlating these surveys can constrain the redshift distribution of radio sources, mitigate systematic effects, and place constraints on cosmological models. We perform the first measurement of the clustering cross-spectrum between radio-continuum sources in the Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey and galaxies from the ESA Euclid satellite mission's Q1 release. Our goal is to detect and characterise the cross-correlation signal, test its robustness against systematic effects, and compare our measurements with theoretical predictions. We use data from the Australian SKA Pathfinder's EMU Main Survey, which overlaps with the Euclid Deep Field South. We generate two radio-source catalogues using different source finders to create galaxy maps. We measure the harmonic-space cross-correlation signal using a pseudo-spectrum estimator. The measured signal is compared to theoretical predictions based on a ΛCDM cosmology, using several models for the EMU source redshift distribution and bias. We report detection above 8σ of the cross-correlation signal consistent across all tested models and data sets. The measured cross-spectra from the two radio catalogues are in excellent agreement, demonstrating that the cross-correlation is robust against the choice of source-finding algorithm. The measured signal also agrees with theoretical models developed from previous cross-correlation studies and simulations. This pathfinder study establishes a statistically significant cross-correlation between EMU and Euclid. The robustness of the signal is a crucial validation of the methodology, paving the way for future large-scale analyses leveraging the full power of this synergy to constrain cosmological parameters and our understanding of galaxy evolution."}

This is because the probability mass of the marginal posterior distribution of the parameter representing the period is usually highly concentrated in a very small region of the parameter space. Therefore, it is necessary to provide as much information as possible to the inference method through the parameter prior distribution. We intend to show that it is possible to construct a prior distribution from the data by fitting a Gaussian process (GP) with a periodic kernel. More specifically, we want to show that it is possible to approximate the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameter corresponding to the period in the kernel. Subsequently, this distribution can be used as a prior distribution for the inference method. We use an adaptive importance sampling method to approximate the posterior distribution of the hyperparameters of the GP. Then, we use the marginal posterior distribution of the hyperparameter related to the periodicity in order to construct a prior distribution for the period of the parametric model. This workflow is empirical Bayes, implemented as a modular (cut) transfer of a GP posterior for the period to the parametric model. We applied the proposed methodology to both synthetic and real data. We approximated the posterior distribution of the period of the GP kernel and then passed it forward as a posterior-as-prior with no feedback. Finally, we analyzed its impact on the marginal posterior distribution."}

We have used a sample of K giant and RRLyrae stars based on Gaia DR3 data and two different set of simulations, to test the new formalism. From our analysis, we found that the inclusion of a nonhomogeneous background improves substantially the estimation of the subhalo dark matter mass. The methodology is not sufficiently sensitive to discriminate between different density distribution functions for the perturber, however, in the case of the observational data, the inclussion of the cloud's circular velocity is a fundamental tool to complement the analysis. The results obtained including the host halo potential agree with the independent previous measurements or with the reported value for the subhalo dark matter mass in the simulations. These results show that it is possible to measure the mass of smaller subhalos through their gravitational wake, even for subhalos closer to their host, with distances lower than 30 kpc."}

We present a hybrid machine-learning (ML) framework that integrates field-level inference (FLI) with simulation-based inference (SBI) to map observed shear fields directly to cosmological parameters, eliminating the need for convergence reconstruction. The FLI network extracts rich non-Gaussian information from the shear field to produce informative features, which are then used by SBI to model the resulting complex posteriors. To mitigate noise from intrinsic galaxy shapes, we develop a blind, training-free, PCA-based shear denoising method. Tests on CSST-like mock catalogs reveal significant performance gains. The shear-based inference achieves approximately twice the cosmological constraining power in Figure of Merit (FoM) compared to the conventional convergence-based approach. Moreover, the combination of PCA denoising and ML compression can deliver a 36.4% improvement in FoM over standard shear two-point statistics. This work establishes a scalable and robust pathway for cosmological inference, unlocking the full potential of Stage-IV weak-lensing surveys."}

We model PVF and HVF velocity distributions using Gaussian Mixture Models, compare Si II and Ca II PVF velocity distributions, assess Ca II HVF properties, and test correlations between Si II PVF velocities and $Δm_{15}$, with emphasis on HVF effects. For the first time, we show that the Ca II PVF velocity distribution, measured for the same events at the same phases as Si II, is predominantly unimodal, in contrast to the well-known bimodal Si II PVF distribution that supports the high-velocity/normal-velocity division. This contrast likely reflects a subclass-dependent formation depth of the Ca II line, as supported by a positive correlation ($>3.3σ$) between $Δm_{15}$ and the velocity offset between Ca II and Si II PVFs, particularly in faster-declining SNe Ia. Importantly, HVFs do not significantly bias PVF velocity distributions. A significant negative correlation ($>3.3σ$) between Si II PVF velocity and $Δm_{15}$ is found only for HVF-weak SNe Ia, consistent with more energetic explosions yielding faster ejecta, while this trend vanishes in HVF-strong events, likely due to circumstellar interaction.

We find that, at the same mass scale, halos that form under the fractional potential are much more dense than those that from the Newtonian potential.

Alongside the classical theory of disk-companion interaction, shadow-based driving has come into vogue as a potential explanation for such large-scale substructures. How might these two mechanisms be distinguished from one another in observations? To investigate this question, we ran a pair of hydrodynamical simulations with \\texttt{PLUTO}. One, with full radiation hydrodynamics and gas-grain collision, was designed to develop shadow-driven spirals at the outer gap edge of a sub-thermal, Saturn-mass planet. The other, with parametrized $β$-cooling, was set up to capture the more standard view of spiral wave excitation by a super-thermal, multi-Jupiter-mass, exterior planetary companion. Post-processing of these simulations with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) code \\texttt{RADMC3D} revealed that strong vertical velocities in the shadow-driven case create a prominent two-armed feature in the moment-1 CO maps, particularly when the disk is viewed face-on in optically thicker isotopologues; such a feature is not seen in the standard planet-driven case. Conversely, the presence or absence of such signatures in two-armed spiral systems would distinguish those potentially driven by exterior, multi-Jupiter-mass companions, and thus help identify promising targets for future direct-imaging campaigns."}

Stellar streams trace satellite disruption and, in the dwarf galaxy regime, are predicted to provide novel constraints on low-mass galaxy evolution and dark matter. However, the mass ratios required to form these streams make them challenging to detect. We present a preview of the Stellar Stream Legacy Survey (SSLS) in the dwarf galaxy regime. The SSLS aims to produce a statistically large, homogeneous sample of stellar streams, in order to yield new constraints on galaxy formation through comparison with theory. We visually inspect dwarf galaxies using the Legacy Imaging Survey (and DECaLS footprints, r-band 29 mag arcsec-2) within 4-35 Mpc. We develop a classification metric to categorise accretion debris around dwarf galaxies, and measure the frequency of accretion features in the footprint. We present the first release of accretion features around dwarf galaxies, including 1 stream, 11 shells, and 8 asymmetric stellar halos, of which 17 constitute new identifications. We find that less than 5.07 percent of dwarfs (37/730) contain detectable accretion features, which is lower than the SSLS results for massive galaxies, and discuss a tentative shell detection bias. Our results highlight the difficulty of detecting streams around dwarf galaxies, and identify the need for improved theoretical modelling of low-mass merger morphologies.

Accepted for publication in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A", "summary": "Dark matter haloes are typically characterised by radial density profiles with fixed forms motivated by simulations (e.g. NFW). However, simulation predictions depend on uncertain dark matter physics and baryonic modelling. Here, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations using Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR), a technique that searches the space of analytic expressions for the function that best balances accuracy and simplicity for a given dataset. We test the approach on mock weak lensing excess surface density (ESD) data of synthetic clusters with NFW profiles. Motivated by real data, we assign each ESD data point a constant fractional uncertainty and vary this uncertainty and the number of clusters to probe how data precision and sample size affect model selection. For fractional errors around 5%, ESR recovers the NFW profile even from samples as small as 20 clusters. At higher uncertainties representative of current surveys, simpler functions are favoured over NFW, though it remains competitive. This preference arises because weak lensing errors are smallest in the outskirts, causing the fits to be dominated by the outer profile. ESR therefore provides a robust, simulation-independent framework both for testing mass models and determining which features of a halo's density profile are genuinely constrained by the data."}

Previous imaging analyses suffer from incompleteness at separations $<2λ/D$; our aim is to probe within this limit to identify previously missed companions. We evaluate the performance of our technique on artificial data across 8 WFC3/IR filters and a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios (S/N), determining our ability to accurately recover injected companions and identifying the region of parameter space where false positive fits are likely. Here, we demonstrate the capability of this technique to recover companions at sub-pixel separations on the WFC3/IR detector -- below the diffraction limit in multiple filters. For F160W at a typical S/N of 75, we resolve companions separated by 0.8 pixels (104 mas, $0.759λ/D$) at 1.5 magnitudes contrast with $>90\\%$ confidence.

On the other hand, we find a decreasing SFR in AGN-hosting dwarf galaxies towards denser environments, as well as an extremely low incidence of quenched isolated dwarfs within both AGN and non-AGN subsamples. These results indicate that although these AGN could potentially regulate the gas reservoir of dwarf galaxies, environmental effects are likely the dominant quenching mechanism in the low-mass universe."}

Accepted for publication in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A", "summary": "Dark matter haloes are typically characterised by radial density profiles with fixed forms motivated by simulations (e.g. NFW). However, simulation predictions depend on uncertain dark matter physics and baryonic modelling. Here, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations using Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR), a technique that searches the space of analytic expressions for the function that best balances accuracy and simplicity for a given dataset. We test the approach on mock weak lensing excess surface density (ESD) data of synthetic clusters with NFW profiles. Motivated by real data, we assign each ESD data point a constant fractional uncertainty and vary this uncertainty and the number of clusters to probe how data precision and sample size affect model selection. For fractional errors around 5%, ESR recovers the NFW profile even from samples as small as 20 clusters. At higher uncertainties representative of current surveys, simpler functions are favoured over NFW, though it remains competitive. This preference arises because weak lensing errors are smallest in the outskirts, causing the fits to be dominated by the outer profile. ESR therefore provides a robust, simulation-independent framework both for testing mass models and determining which features of a halo's density profile are genuinely constrained by the data."}

Traditional methods for identifying bars are often labor-intensive and subjective, limiting their scalability for large astronomical surveys. To address this, a synthetic dataset of 1,000 barred spiral galaxy images was generated, incorporating realistic components such as disks, bars, bulges, spiral arms, stars, and observational noise, modeled through Gaussian, Ferrers, and Sersic functions. The YOLO-OBB model, trained on this dataset for six epochs, achieved robust validation metrics, including a precision of 0.93745, recall of 0.85, and mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.94173. Applied to 10 real galaxy images, the model extracted physical parameters, such as bar lengths ranging from 2.27 to 9.70 kpc and orientations from 13.41$^\\circ$ to 134.11$^\\circ$, with detection confidences between 0.26 and 0.68. These measurements, validated through pixel-to-kiloparsec conversions, align with established bar sizes, demonstrating the model's reliability. The methodology's scalability and interpretability enable efficient analysis of complex galaxy morphologies, particularly for dwarf galaxies and varied orientations. Future research aims to expand the dataset to 5,000 galaxies and integrate the Tremaine-Weinberg method to measure bar pattern speeds, enhancing insights into galaxy dynamics and evolution. This work advances automated morphological analysis, offering a transformative tool for large-scale astronomical studies."}

Two of its remarkable features are (i) inflation can be realized even by very steep potentials and (ii) such a scenario doesn't call for a separate post-inflation reheating phase. We exploit the first feature to show that Warm Inflation can successfully take place on the very steep left wing of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential while remaining in excellent agreement with current cosmological data (joint analysis of Planck, ACT and DESI). The Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential has a flatter right wing as well, which opens up the possibility of dark energy when the field rolls along this wing. However in order to successfully realize quintessential inflation one needs to (i) normalize the two wings of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential differently in order to bridge between the two extreme energy scales of inflation and dark energy, (ii) allow the quintessence field to be dissipative, which is consistent with the presence of a dissipative term in warm inflation. The dissipative dynamics of the quintessence field is needed in order to sustain slow-roll in the right wing. With these modifications, we demonstrate that the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential can give rise to a unified model of warm inflation (on the left wing) and transient dark energy (on the right wing)."}

Here, we apply our method to VVVX data covering low-latitude regions of the Galactic bulge and disk, affected by extinction and crowding.\n  Methods: We introduce the Consensus-based Algorithm for Nonparametric Detection of Star Clusters (CANDiSC), which integrates kernel density estimation, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and nearest-neighbour density estimation within a consensus framework. A stellar overdensity is classified as a candidate if identified by at least two of these methods. We apply CANDiSC to 680 tiles in the VVVX PSF photometric catalogue, covering approximately 1100 square degrees.\n  Results: We detect 163 stellar overdensities, of which 118 are known clusters. Cross-matching with recent catalogues yields five additional matches, leaving 40 likely new candidates absent from existing compilations. The estimated false-positive rate is below 5 percent.\n  Conclusions: CANDiSC offers a robust and scalable approach for detecting stellar clusters in deep near-infrared surveys, successfully recovering known systems and revealing new candidates in the obscured and crowded regions of the Galactic plane."}

This represents the highest-significance pairwise kSZ measurement to date. The analysis uses three ACT CMB temperature maps: co-added 150 GHz, total frequency maps, and a component-separated Internal Linear Combination (ILC) map, all of which cover 19,000 square degrees of the sky from Advanced ACTPol observations conducted between 2017 and 2022. Comparison of the results of these three maps serves as a consistency check for potential foreground contamination that may depend on the observation frequency. An estimate of the best-fit mass-averaged optical depth is obtained by comparing the pairwise kSZ curve with the linear-theory prediction of the pairwise velocity under the best-fit Planck cosmology, and is compared with predictions from simulations. This estimate serves as a reference point for future comparisons with thermal SZ-derived optical depth measurements for the same DESI cluster samples, which will be presented in a companion paper. Finally, we employ a machine-learning approach trained on simulations to estimate the optical depth for 456,803 DESI LRG-identified clusters within the simulated mass range (greater than about 1e13 solar masses). These are combined with the measured kSZ signal to infer the individual cluster peculiar velocities, providing the opportunity to constrain the behavior of gravity and the dark sector over a range of cosmic scales and epochs."}

Using five Milky Way-mass halos from the Aquarius simulations, we introduce an information-theoretic framework to quantify spatial-chemical correlations through the mutual information (MI) between angular position and metallicity. We divide stars in each halo into high- and low-metallicity populations based on their median metallicity and examine their metallicity distribution functions (MDFs), spatial anisotropies, and angular-metallicity couplings as a function of galactocentric radius. The MDFs exhibit remarkable diversity, ranging from single-peaked distributions dominated by one or two massive progenitors to broad or bimodal forms shaped by multiple accretion events, revealing the stochastic nature of halo assembly. The low-metallicity stars, primarily contributed by disrupted satellites, display higher spatial anisotropy and stronger angular clustering than their metal-rich counterparts. After removing bound satellites, anisotropy decreases significantly, yet high-metallicity stars remain marginally more anisotropic, reflecting the lingering debris of massive, centrally deposited progenitors. The mutual information between angular position and metallicity increases with radius before saturating in the outskirts, with the difference between the data and randomized controls confined mainly to the inner halo signifying residual spatial-chemical coupling driven by incomplete phase mixing. Our results demonstrate that information-theoretic diagnostics provide a powerful and intuitive way to quantify the chemical complexity of stellar halos and offer a promising route to compare simulations with forthcoming high-dimensional Galactic survey data."}

The neutrino mass is modeled as a power-law, exponential, or hybrid function of the scalar field, yielding an effective potential that includes neutrino backreaction. Starting from the Einstein-Hilbert action in a flat FLRW background, we derive the modified Friedmann and Klein Gordon equations incorporating this coupling. Using the Fermi-Dirac integrals, we account for the continuous transition of neutrinos from relativistic to non-relativistic regimes. The inflationary dynamics are analyzed via the slow roll parameters derived from the effective potential. Our results show that the scalar neutrino coupling alters the potential slope and curvature, thereby influencing the duration of inflation. The hybrid coupling form provides the most flexible realization, unifying neutrino mass generation with early universe inflation within a single scalar field framework."}

The B4R receiver was developed based on the dual-polarization sideband-separating mixer technology of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, and is equipped with a fast Fourier transform digital spectrometer, XFFTS. The primary science objective is the spectroscopic redshift identification of high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies, complementing the existing 3 mm Redshift Search Receiver by enabling the detection of multiple carbon monoxide lines. Additionally, the B4R receiver broadens the range of science cases possible with the LMT, including astrochemistry, as the 2 mm band encompasses unique molecular lines such as deuterated molecules and shock tracers. During on-site commissioning in 2018 and 2019, we successfully demonstrated on-the-fly mapping and position-switching observations toward the Orion Molecular Cloud 1 and bright high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies, respectively. We confirmed that the installed B4R system largely met its basic performance specifications. Furthermore, we measured the LMT's aperture efficiencies across the entire B4R frequency range (130-160 GHz), finding them to be roughly consistent with expectations based on a surface accuracy of 100 $μ$m and the receiver optics design. These results with the B4R will enable the most sensitive single-dish spectroscopic observations at 2 mm using the LMT."}

We start using the present-day photon density as an anchor, and use the baryon-to-photon ratio from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis based measurements and the baryon-to-matter ratio from the baryons' imprint on galaxy clustering to translate to a physical matter density at present day. We then compare this to measurements of the ratio of the matter density to the critical density ($Ω_{\\mathrm{m}}$), calculated using the relative positions of the baryon acoustic oscillations, to measure the critical density of the universe and hence $H_0$. The important measurements of the evolution of the energy density all happen at low redshift, so we consider this a low-redshift measurement. We validate our method both on a suite of $N$-body mocks and on noiseless theory vectors generated across a wide range of Hubble parameters in both $Λ$CDM and EDE cosmologies. Using DESI DR1 data combined with the angular CMB acoustic scale and the latest BBN constraints, we find $H_0 = 69.0 \\pm 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, consistent with existing early and late-time determinations of the Hubble constant. We consider the impact of non-standard dark energy evolution on our measurement.

This produces a different pre-recombination distribution of baryons and dark matter. After recombination, the gravitational potential responds to both components in proportion to their mass, allowing robust measurement of the baryon fraction. This is independent of new-physics scenarios altering the recombination background (e.g. Early Dark Energy). The accuracy of such measurements does, however, depend on how baryons and CDM are modeled in the power spectrum. Previous template-based splitting relied on approximate transfer functions that neglected part of information. We present a new method that embeds an extra parameter controlling the balance between baryons and dark matter in the growth terms of the perturbation equations in the CAMB Boltzmann solver. This approach captures the baryonic suppression of CDM prior to recombination, avoids inconsistencies, and yields a clean parametrization of the baryon fraction in the linear power spectrum, separating out the simple physics of growth due to the combined matter potential. We implement this framework in an analysis pipeline using Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure with HOD-informed priors and validate it against noiseless LCDM and EDE cosmologies with DESI-like errors. The new scheme achieves comparable precision to previous splitting while reducing systematic biases, providing a more robust way to baryon-fraction measurements. In combination with BBN constraints on the baryon density and Alcock-Paczynski estimates of the matter density, these results strengthen the use of baryon fraction measurements to derive a Hubble constant from energy densities, with future DESI and Euclid data expected to deliver competitive constraints."}

Furthermore, the data suggest that the equation of state may have been in the phantom regime in the distant past, recently undergoing a phantom crossing. In this work, we investigate whether this preference can be realized within a kinetically mixed axion-dilaton (KMIX) quintessence model, a string-motivated system in which an axion-like field couples exponentially to a dilaton-like (moduli) field. Crucially, KMIX can appear phantom in a standard Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) based analysis. To confront the model with data, we develop a fast pipeline based on normalizing flows that (i) learns a theory-informed prior on $(w_0,w_a)$ from KMIX realizations and (ii) provides an inverse mapping from CPL parameters back to the physical KMIX parameters. By importance-sampling pre-computed CPL chains using this framework, we effectively transform generic phenomenological constraints into direct, computationally efficient constraints on the underlying KMIX theory, avoiding the prohibitive cost of full parameter space exploration. Applied to Planck+DESI DR2 BAO measurements, our framework finds support for KMIX at $2.5σ$ compared to the base CPL fit at $3.1σ$, demonstrating that KMIX may account for the DESI preference without invoking true phantom behavior. When additionally including Type Ia supernovae data, we find that the preference remains above $3σ$ for Union3 and DES Y5, but drops to $2.1σ$ with Pantheon+. The latter, combined with the DESI full-shape power spectrum and bispectrum data, further reduces the preference to $1.7σ$. Ultimately, should the DESI deviation persist with future data, KMIX may offer a theoretically well-motivated explanation for the phantom-like signatures inferred from phenomenological fits."}

We demonstrate that these extended objects generate distinctive signatures that depart markedly from point-mass lenses like primordial black holes. The smoking-gun signature for these exotic objects is the emergence of caustics, which form when the lens radius is below a critical threshold. Crossing these caustics induces discontinuous jumps in the images-centroid trajectory, a distinctive feature of these extended dark objects. We show these patterns are sensitive to the internal mass profile, with boson stars generating larger, more prominent caustic structures than Q-balls -- enabling the models to be distinguished. Using the Gaia DR3 stellar catalogue, we forecast a high-yield discovery potential, up to $\\sim 6000$ detectable astrometric microlensing events for a 10-year mission, peaking for $M \\sim 1-10~M_\\odot$ and $R \\lesssim 10~\\text{AU}$.

In this paper, using a data-driven framework based on binned Gaussian processes, we characterize the joint distribution of BBH primary masses, mass ratios, and effective inspiral spins. We identify three distinct subpopulations in the GWTC-4 sample of observations and investigate their astrophysical origins. We find that only one of the three subpopulations exhibits the $35M_{\\odot}$ peak, which is characterized by a strong preference for equal mass systems and isotropic spin orientations. Our inferred distributions are consistent with a predominantly dynamical origin of this feature. By comparing with theoretical simulations, we further show that the subpopulation that exhibits the $35M_{\\sun}$ peak can exclusively comprise dynamically assembled systems in globular clusters, specifically if black hole birth spins are in the range~$(0.1-0.2)$, whereas the other two subpopulations require substantial contributions from alternative formation channels. We constrain the \\textit{lower bound} on the merger rate of BBHs in globular clusters to be $0.69^{+0.23}_{-0.33} \\rm{Gpc}^{-3}\\rm{yr}^{-1}$, which is consistent with theoretical predictions.

A counterintuitive feature of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) second data release is that restricting the dataset to the last 10.3 years (DR2new) increases the inferred GWB significance from $\\leq2σ$ for the full 25-year dataset (DR2full) to $\\geq3.5σ$. We investigate whether this behaviour indicates an anomaly or is a possible outcome of the pipeline. Using realistic, DR2-like simulations with varying timespans, we find that the first 10 years contribute little to the GWB evidence due to their limited frequency coverage. This produces substantial overlap between the HD S/N distributions of DR2full and DR2new. Random noise fluctuations therefore yield a higher GWB evidence in DR2new than in DR2full in $15\\%$ of cases. Furthermore, $5\\%$ of simulations match the HD S/N of the real data, indicating that the observed behaviour is consistent with being a $\\sim2σ$ outcome due to noise fluctuations. Regardless of significance, DR2new simulations introduce biases in the GWB parameter estimation due to spectral leakage effects that are ignored in standard analyses and which flatten the inferred spectrum. Including leakage removes these biases, demonstrating the reliability of DR2new when the signal is properly modelled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that combining EPTA DR2full with long-baseline data from NANOGrav and PPTA, as well as low-frequency data from LOFAR and NenuFAR, significantly enhances GWB evidence and parameter accuracy. Finally, we examine the impact of the observation timespan and find that short-baseline datasets introduce strong amplitude biases and are ineffective at constraining the GWB."}

We report the first detailed analysis of the giant radio halo in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 2163, using upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and Very Large Array (VLA) observations. Combining radio data (300-1400 MHz) with archival X-ray data offers a unique opportunity to study the complex ICM physics of the cluster. The sensitive uGMRT observations map the halo emission for the first time out to an extent of ~3.3 Mpc, up to $r_{500}$, and also effectively recover other diffuse sources. The radio surface brightness profile is well fitted with an exponential function up to r$_{500}$, with an evolution of e-folding radius over frequencies (larger at low frequencies). The spatially resolved spectral index map reveals fluctuations and outward radial steepening of the average spectral index. Radio and X-ray surface brightness are well correlated, with a correlation slope of $\\sim$0.70 for the halo, and $\\sim$0.40 for the ridge. The correlation slope varies from cluster centre to outskirts, suggesting the magnetic field and thermal gas density scaling relation (B $\\propto n_{e}^{0.5}$) should be reassessed, provided that the re-acceleration efficiency is constant. We propose that diffuse lobes at the periphery could serve as a reservoir for seed electrons, behind the radio halo emission, with an estimated acceleration efficiency reaching $\\sim$0.1% in the external regions. Additionally, a major E-W merger is suggested, leading to turbulence in the ICM and generating the halo."}

We aim to understand the relationship between the power of AGN feedback and the cooling of gas in the centres of galaxy clusters by correlating the radio properties of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) with the X-ray properties of their host clusters. We used catalogues from the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) along with ASKAP radio data. In total, we identified 134 radio sources associated with BCGs of the 151 eRASS1 clusters located in the PS1, PS2, and SWAG-X ASKAP fields. Non-detections were treated as upper limits. We correlated BCG radio luminosity, largest linear size (LLS), and BCG offset with the integrated X-ray luminosity of their host clusters. To characterise cool cores (CCs) and non-cool cores (NCCs), we used the concentration parameter $c_{R_{500}}$ and combined it with the BCG offset to assess cluster dynamical state. We analysed the correlation between radio mechanical power and X-ray luminosity within the CC subsample. We observe a potential positive trend between LLS and BCG offset, suggesting an environmental effect on radio-source morphology. We find a weak trend where more luminous central radio galaxies are found in clusters with higher X-ray luminosity. Within the CC subsample, there is a positive but highly scattered relationship between the mechanical luminosity of AGN jets and the X-ray cooling luminosity. This finding is supported by bootstrap resampling and flux-flux analyses. The correlation indicates that AGN feedback is ineffective in high-luminosity (high-mass) clusters. At a cooling luminosity of $L_{\\mathrm{X},~r<R_\\mathrm{cool}}\\approx 5.50\\times10^{43}$ erg/s, on average, AGN feedback appears to contribute only about 13%-22% of the energy needed to offset the radiative losses in the ICM."}

We study the misalignment dynamics of a scalar condensate Yukawa coupled to $N_f$ fermions in a manifestly energy conserving, fully renormalized Hamiltonian framework.

The observed separation distribution of known brown dwarf (BD) binaries is potentially biased towards separations larger than the angular resolution limits of current techniques. Previous imaging analyses suffer from incompleteness at separations $<2λ/D$; our aim is to probe within this limit to identify previously missed companions. We evaluate the performance of our technique on artificial data across 8 WFC3/IR filters and a broad range of signal-to-noise ratios (S/N), determining our ability to accurately recover injected companions and identifying the region of parameter space where false positive fits are likely. Here, we demonstrate the capability of this technique to recover companions at sub-pixel separations on the WFC3/IR detector -- below the diffraction limit in multiple filters. For F160W at a typical S/N of 75, we resolve companions separated by 0.8 pixels (104 mas, $0.759λ/D$) at 1.5 magnitudes contrast with $>90\\%$ confidence. We achieve the closest angular resolution for any detection method with WFC3/IR imaging to date.

However, simulation predictions depend on uncertain dark matter physics and baryonic modelling. Here, we present a method to constrain halo density profiles directly from observations using Exhaustive Symbolic Regression (ESR), a technique that searches the space of analytic expressions for the function that best balances accuracy and simplicity for a given dataset. We test the approach on mock weak lensing excess surface density (ESD) data of synthetic clusters with NFW profiles. Motivated by real data, we assign each ESD data point a constant fractional uncertainty and vary this uncertainty and the number of clusters to probe how data precision and sample size affect model selection. For fractional errors around 5%, ESR recovers the NFW profile even from samples as small as 20 clusters. At higher uncertainties representative of current surveys, simpler functions are favoured over NFW, though it remains competitive. This preference arises because weak lensing errors are smallest in the outskirts, causing the fits to be dominated by the outer profile. ESR therefore provides a robust, simulation-independent framework both for testing mass models and determining which features of a halo's density profile are genuinely constrained by the data."}

While these definitions are equivalent in Minkowski spacetime, they differ significantly in de Sitter. We demonstrate this by computing them both explicitly at one-loop order in perturbation theory. It is well known that the perturbative expansion of the standard effective potential fails converge for light fields. In contrast, the constraint effective potential does not suffer from this infrared problem, and it can therefore be computed using perturbation theory. We discuss the physical interpretation of the two effective potentials. In particular, we provide evidence supporting an earlier conjecture that the constraint effective potential is the correct one to use in the stochastic Starobinsky-Yokoyama theory."}

These systems are known to host disks with Keplerian or quasi-Keplerian dynamics and to drive outflows of gas escaping from the rotating disk. These binary post-AGB stars can be categorized into two subclasses depending on the predominance of specific kinematic components: disk-dominated and outflow-dominated sources. We present the survey of such sources observed in CO using the IRAM-30m telescope, in which we aim to identify the molecular gas in these circumbinary-disk-containing post-AGB nebulae. We aim to analyze the mass distribution of the disk objects studied in CO. We present high-sensitivity mm-wave observations of the CO line emission from ten binary post-AGB stars. Using the derived formulation and observational data, we calculated the mass of the total gas in the CO-emitting regions of these nebulae. The logarithmic distribution of nebular masses was analyzed using a normal model that incorporates censored data, enabling a more comprehensive analysis and yielding more accurate and representative results. CO emission is detected in six post-AGB nebulae from our sample. We have significantly increased the sample of observed sources in CO lines. Some of these objects exhibit very weak molecular emission. Within the sample of disk-containing sources, the total gas mass spans a range of 1E-4 to 1E-1 Mo. The results derived from this work, along with those from a previous CO single-dish survey and interferometric data, show that this class of binary post-AGB stars exhibits a large range of nebular masses (including both the rotating disk and the expanding component), with variations exceeding a factor of 600. The typical nebular mass of these objects, accounting for both detections and non-detections through censored data analysis, is approximately 2E-3 Mo."}

In particular, we aim to include different density distribution functions for the perturber and a non homogeneous background due to the host's halo gravitational potential. We have used a sample of K giant and RRLyrae stars based on Gaia DR3 data and two different set of simulations, to test the new formalism. From our analysis, we found that the inclusion of a nonhomogeneous background improves substantially the estimation of the subhalo dark matter mass. The methodology is not sufficiently sensitive to discriminate between different density distribution functions for the perturber, however, in the case of the observational data, the inclussion of the cloud's circular velocity is a fundamental tool to complement the analysis. The results obtained including the host halo potential agree with the independent previous measurements or with the reported value for the subhalo dark matter mass in the simulations. These results show that it is possible to measure the mass of smaller subhalos through their gravitational wake, even for subhalos closer to their host, with distances lower than 30 kpc."}

This field interacts with baryons and leptons via a vector-current coupling and, by construction, acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Accordingly, the theory also exhibits a spontaneous violation of Lorentz invariance, effectively realizing a Bumblebee model. In this picture, the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson arising from spontaneous breaking of the $U(1)_B$ global symmetry is the global phase of the Bumblebee vector and, in the broken phase, it results minimally coupled with the baryonic current, guaranteeing the violation of the baryon number. Consequently, we assume that the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone, arising from spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_B$, plays the role of the inflaton, leading to baryogenesis across the entire inflationary stage, up to when the inflaton decays into baryon-antilepton and antibaryon-lepton pairs through a CP-violating interaction that also violates the Lorentz symmetry. Afterwards, we address the issue of flavor oscillations among baryon and lepton fields, including the oscillation probability in the calculation of the baryon asymmetry. Remarkably, our framework predicts a non-null mixing factor even for massless fermions. This mixing acts on the spatial momenta rather than on the masses of the produced fermions, allowing larger values of the coupling constant even guaranteeing the production of light fermions. The net baryon asymmetry results accordingly modified, and may also reproduce the experimental data for allowed values of the coupling constant."}

We adopt standard momentum-space techniques to show how multipartite entanglement arises for inflationary perturbation modes, focusing on the dynamics of the comoving curvature perturbation. In particular, we quantify entanglement generation via the recently proposed Entanglement Distance, which introduces a geometric interpretation of quantum correlations in terms of the Fubini-Study metric. In the continuum limit, we show that the Entanglement Distance arising from displacement transformations is proportional to the total number of excitations in the quantum state for cubic perturbations, thus providing an upper bound on the von Neumann entanglement entropy of any reduced state compatible with such excitations. Within the interaction picture, we further observe that the quantum correlations arising from cubic gravitational interactions are typically much larger than the standard squeezing contribution, in agreement with previous studies focusing on von Neumann entropy generation across the Hubble horizon. We further show how the inflationary parameters affect the total amount of such correlations, highlighting in particular their dependence on the inflationary energy scales and the number of e-foldings during slow-roll."}

The topology explicitly breaks important symmetries, such as translational invariance and (5+1)-dimensional CP invariance. Somewhat surprisingly, the (3+1)-dimensional cp of the Minkowski space can also be broken by the Klein Bottle, both explicitly and in the presence of a brane. The topology enforces a background of fermion correlations that amounts to a condensate wall localized in the Klein Bottle. The wall acts as an order parameter for the broken symmetries. If a brane passes through the wall, brane fermions that couple to the condensate are produced as quantified by the Bogoliubov coefficients for a time-dependent mass. The scenario meets the conditions, including cp violation, to potentially generate the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe."}

Using five Milky Way-mass halos from the Aquarius simulations, we introduce an information-theoretic framework to quantify spatial-chemical correlations through the mutual information (MI) between angular position and metallicity. We divide stars in each halo into high- and low-metallicity populations based on their median metallicity and examine their metallicity distribution functions (MDFs), spatial anisotropies, and angular-metallicity couplings as a function of galactocentric radius. The MDFs exhibit remarkable diversity, ranging from single-peaked distributions dominated by one or two massive progenitors to broad or bimodal forms shaped by multiple accretion events, revealing the stochastic nature of halo assembly. The low-metallicity stars, primarily contributed by disrupted satellites, display higher spatial anisotropy and stronger angular clustering than their metal-rich counterparts. After removing bound satellites, anisotropy decreases significantly, yet high-metallicity stars remain marginally more anisotropic, reflecting the lingering debris of massive, centrally deposited progenitors. The mutual information between angular position and metallicity increases with radius before saturating in the outskirts, with the difference between the data and randomized controls confined mainly to the inner halo signifying residual spatial-chemical coupling driven by incomplete phase mixing. Our results demonstrate that information-theoretic diagnostics provide a powerful and intuitive way to quantify the chemical complexity of stellar halos and offer a promising route to compare simulations with forthcoming high-dimensional Galactic survey data."}
