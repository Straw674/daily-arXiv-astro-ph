Comments welcome!", "summary": "Galaxies at Cosmic Noon (z$\\sim$2-3) are characterized by rapid star\nformation that will lead to significant metal enrichment in the interstellar\nmedium (ISM). While much observational evidence suggests that these galaxies\nare chemically distinct from those in the local Universe, directly measuring\nthe ISM chemistry in large samples of high-z galaxies is only now possible with\nthe observational capabilities of JWST. In this first key paper of the CECILIA\nprogram, we present the direct-method physical conditions and multi-element\nabundances in twenty galaxies at Cosmic Noon. Using a combination of archival\nKeck/MOSFIRE and new $\\sim$30-hr NIRSpec spectroscopy, we measure multiple\nelectron gas densities and the temperature structure from the O$^+$ and\nS$^{2+}$ ions. We find that n$_e$[O II] and n$_e$[S II] are comparable but\nelevated with respect to n$_e$ in local star-forming galaxies, and the\nsimultaneous T$_e$[O II] and T$_e$[S III] generally agree with photoionization\nmodel T$_e$ scaling relations. The O abundances in the CECILIA galaxies range\nfrom 12+log(O/H)$=$7.76-8.78 (12-123% solar O/H), representing some of the\nhighest direct-method metallicities and lowest T$_e$ measured with JWST to\ndate. The CECILIA galaxies exhibit significantly sub-solar S/O and Ar/O, in\nagreement with emerging results from other high-z studies and a signature of\npredominant enrichment from core collapse supernovae. The N/O-O/H trends in the\nCECILIA galaxies generally agree with the abundance trends in local nebulae,\nbut the large scatter in N/O could be sensitive to the star-formation history.\nThe CECILIA observations underscore the need for exceptionally deep\nspectroscopy to unveil the ISM abundance patterns in high-z galaxies."}

In this work, we present a systematic analysis of the chemical and\nmulti-temperature structure of the intra-group medium (IGrM), using a subsample\nof nearby galaxy groups and ellipticals from the CHEERS catalogue. By comparing\nareas with and without AGN feedback related features, such as cavities or\nextended radio lobes, we find clear evidence of an excess of multi-phase gas\nalong the path of recent AGN feedback. However, its distribution exceeds the\nlength of the radio lobes, since we recover a non-negligible amount of\nmulti-phase gas at larger radii. In contrast to the clear asymmetry in the\nthermal structure, we find no directional enhancement in the distribution of\nFe, with little to no differences in the Fe abundances of the on- and off-lobe\ndirections.

In this paper we demonstrate, via a series of\nnumerical experiments conducted in cosmological zoom-in simulations, that a\nlikely pathway for this dust accumulation in the first formed galaxies is\nthrough production at early times via supernovae, followed by the rapid growth\non ultrasmall dust grains. Our main results follow. The stellar production of\ndust dominates until z ~ 10-11 at which point galaxies transition to a\ngrowth-dominated regime. We employ a Shapley analysis to demonstrate that the\nlocal density is the dominant factor driving dust growth, followed by the grain\nsize distribution.

We\nfind percent-level constraints on $H_0$ with complete catalogs, reaching\nprecision of 1.6%, 1.3%, and 0.9% for constant, linear, and quadratic mass\nweighting, respectively. As completeness decreases, the precision degrades\nfollowing a sigmoid trend, with a threshold and steepness that increase for\nstronger weightings. Simultaneously, the correlation between $H_0$ and the BBH\npopulation mass scale also increases, making results more sensitive to\nassumptions about the astrophysical population. Remarkably, 2% precision\nremains achievable when catalogs contain only 50% of the potential host\ngalaxies within the gravitational wave detection horizon, while 1% precision\nrequires host probabilities scaling with stellar mass squared.

We reconstruct their star formation histories\nand find that they have large bursts ($100\\textrm{ M}_{\\odot} \\textrm{yr}^{-1}\n-1000 \\textrm{ M}_{\\odot} \\textrm{yr}^{-1}$), followed by a rapid truncation of\nstar formation. The number densities of the quenched galaxies in our sample\nthat we predict underwent a submillimeter phase are consistent with\nsubmillimeter galaxies being the progenitors of our quenched population. The\nmedian post-starburst visibility time is $\\sim600$ Myr, with more massive\ngalaxies ($\\log \\textrm{M}_*/\\textrm{M}_\\odot > 10.7$) exhibiting shorter\nvisibility times than lower mass galaxies. The range of quenching times --\ndefined as the time from the peak starburst to the time of quiescence -- found\nin this sample ($0.06-1.75$ Gyr) suggests multiple quenching pathways,\nconsistent with previous studies. We do not see evidence for quenching\nmechanisms varying with redshift between $1<z<3$. We detect evidence for weak\nAGN activity in 4 out of the 8 galaxies with robust emission line detections,\nbased on line ratio diagnostics. Our findings suggest that there are a diverse\nrange of quenching mechanisms at cosmic noon, and support a scenario in which\nthe primary quenching mechanisms are rapid ($<500$ Myr) following a starburst."}

Contrary to\npredictions based on thermodynamic equilibrium, recent observations reveal a\ndiverse array of high-energy isomers and conformers. One of the most iconic\nmolecular isomers detected in space, formic acid (HCOOH, FA), has been the\nfocus of extensive theoretical research aimed at understanding its speciation\ninto cis and trans conformers in dark clouds and photodissociation regions. In\nthis work, we report the detection of c-FA, the higher-energy conformer, using\nultrasensitive observations of TMC-1. This detection adds to previous findings\nin the Barnard-5 and L483 dark clouds. The derived trans-to-cis isomer ratio in\nTMC-1, 17.5, closely matches those observed in other sources, suggesting that\nthe same chemical processes are at play across these environments. To\ninvestigate this, we conducted detailed astrochemical gas-grain models tailored\nto formic acid isomerism to explain the observed ratios. Our models\nsuccessfully reproduce the observed trans/cis ratios and indicate that the\npresence of cis-formic acid can be attributed to the release of c-FA from\ngrains, followed by isomerization driven by the excess energy released during\nthe desorption process, a process that we name as isomerization upon\ndesorption. The models also show that the isomerization of t-FA to c-FA in the\ngas phase is negligible at 10 K, meaning the observed ratios are a direct\nconsequence of the formation pathways of both isomers on the surface of dust\ngrains. However, at higher temperatures, quantum tunneling mediated direct\nisomerization in the gas becomes significant, and the ratios converge toward\nthe thermodynamic equilibrium value."}

The\npresent paper aims to analyse the properties of groups in various evolutionary\nstages (FGs, \"almost\" FGs, and non-FGs), and to increase the sample of FG\ncandidates. We have spectroscopically observed galaxies in four groups and ten\ncandidate FGs detected in the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. We\nsearched for substructures by applying the Serna-Gerbal dendrogram method to\nanalyse the dynamical structure of each group. By applying the FIREFLY software\nto the continuum and PIPE_VIS to the emission lines, we derived the stellar\npopulation properties in various regions for each group. A roughly continuous\nvariation in properties is found between a group that is still building up\n(XCLASS 1330), a well-formed massive group (MCG+00-27-023), a dynamically\ncomplex non-FG (NGC 4065), and a near-FG (NGC 4104). We also optically confirm\ntwo FGs in the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, but their X-ray\nluminosity is still unknown. We observe that the lower the mass of the\nsubstructure, the more recent the stellar population in the considered groups.\nWe also show an apparent lack of high-mass substructures for low-metallicity\nsystems. These results are consistent with the generally adopted model of\nenergy transfer during interactions of the galaxies with the group and cluster\npotential wells. Furthermore, the fossil status of a group might be related to\nthe large-scale environment. Therefore, studying the positions of non-FGs,\nnear-FGs, and FGs within the cosmic web can provide insights into the process\nof how fossil systems come into being in the Universe."}

An\nimportant, yet often neglected, role of gravity is its ability in driving\nanisotropic fragmentation through tides.

By comparing\nareas with and without AGN feedback related features, such as cavities or\nextended radio lobes, we find clear evidence of an excess of multi-phase gas\nalong the path of recent AGN feedback.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Gas-phase metallicity is a fundamental parameter that helps constrain the\nstar-forming history and chemical evolution of a galaxy. Measuring electron\ntemperature through auroral-to-strong line ratios is a direct approach to\nderiving metallicity. However, there is a longstanding discrepancy between\nmetallicity measured through the direct method and that based on the\nphotoionization models. This paper aims to verify and understand the\ndiscrepancies. We bin ~ 1.5 million spaxels from SDSS-IV MaNGA according to\nmetallicity and ionization parameters derived from theoretical strong-line\ncalibrations. We stack the spectra of spaxels within each bin and measure the\nflux of strong lines and faint auroral lines. Auroral lines for [OII], [SII],\n[OIII], and [SIII] are detected in the stacked spectra of most bins, and the\n[NII] auroral line is detected in fewer bins. We apply an empirical method to\ncorrect dust attenuation, which makes more realistic corrections for low\nionization lines. We derive electron temperatures for these five ionic species\nand measure the oxygen and sulfur abundances using the direct method. We\npresent the resulting abundance measurements and compare them with those\nmodel-calibrated strong-line abundances. The chemical abundances measured with\nthe direct method are lower than those derived from the photoionization model,\nwith a median of 0.09 dex. This discrepancy is smaller compared to the results\nbased on other metallicity calibrations previously reported. However, we notice\nthat the direct method could not account for the variation in ionization\nparameters, indicating that the precise calibration of metallicity using the\ndirect method has yet to be fully realized. We report significant discrepancies\nbetween data and the photoionization model, which illustrates that the\none-dimensional photoionization model is incapable of representing the\ncomplexity of real situations."}

Yet, the theory of Ly$\\alpha$ transfer through\nanisotropic gas distributions remains underdeveloped. We present Monte Carlo\nradiative transfer simulations of Ly$\\alpha$ propagation through porous,\ninhomogeneous neutral gas, systematically exploring the effects of channel\ngeometry, outflows, dust, and lognormally distributed column densities. We find\nthat Ly$\\alpha$ photons do not preferentially escape through the\nlowest-column-density pathways, but instead traverse channels of substantial\noptical depth, leading to suppressed central flux and the absence of strongly\nbeamed escape. Subdividing channels has little impact, indicating that geometry\nand covering fraction are more important than porosity. Channels containing\nmoderate amounts of neutral hydrogen alter escape in characteristic ways,\nincluding the appearance of quadruple-peaked spectra, which can be captured by\na simple flux-channel relation. Outflows reshape the spectra by facilitating\nescape through dense media, redshifting photons and blending central features,\nwhile dust modulates the visibility of small channels by suppressing flux at\nline center; in both cases, we develop an analytical model that predicts the\nresulting central fluxes. Extending to lognormal column density fields, we show\nthat Ly$\\alpha$ photons probe a broad range of optical depths, producing skewed\nspectra that can be approximated by weighted sums of homogeneous models. Our\nresults have direct implications for using Ly$\\alpha$ as a tracer of gas\nproperties and ionizing photon escape; for instance, spectra suggestive of high\ncolumn densities may nonetheless allow LyC leakage through narrow channels."}

We tested three models: a single linear gradient, a segmented fit\nwith one break, and a segmented fit with two breaks. Although model selection\nis statistically inconclusive, segmented fits indicate a change in slope near\nthe solar radius ($R \\sim 8$ kpc), with a flatter or slightly positive gradient\ninward and a steeper negative gradient outward.

The algorithm proceeds in two main stages: first,\nquantities exchanged between particles and the mesh -- such as mass, energy,\nand momentum added by stellar feedback or removed by accretion onto a sink --\nare deposited into a buffer mesh equipped with ghost zones, where multiple\ncontributions per cell are accumulated using atomic additions and then\ncommunicated across distributed memory ranks. In the second stage, the buffer\nstates are applied to real mesh states, incorporating cell-wise limiters to\nenforce physical constraints such as positive density.

We find the transition from embedded to\nexposed is fast for individual stars, within 1.3 Myr after the star reaches its\nmaximum mass. This rapid transition is dominated by massive stars, which\naccrete while remaining highly obscured until their feedback eventually\nbalances, then overcomes, the local accretion. For these massive stars, their\nmaximum mass is reached simultaneously with their emergence. Once these stars\nare revealed, their localized, pre-supernova feedback then impacts the cloud,\ndriving gas clearance. Because massive stars dominate the luminosity, their\nfast, local evolution dominates the light emergence from the dust. We calculate\nthe dependence of these processes on the mass of the cloud and find that\nemergence always depends on when massive stars form, which scales with the\ncloud's free-fall time. We also examine the evolution of dust emission and\nH$\\alpha$ luminosity. We find that dust dominates the luminosity for roughly 2\nMyrs before stellar luminosity becomes more luminous. These results suggest\nthat deeply embedded star-forming clusters tend to be rare compared to those\npartially exposed.

By\naccounting for the contribution of the s-process from low-mass asymptotic giant\nbranch stars, the abundances of s-rich stars in M22 can also be fitted\neffectively. In addition, the increasing trend in the s-process component\ncoefficients with rising [Fe/H] indicates a gradual increase in the\ncontribution from low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars."}

To enhance\nastrophysical realism, the study incorporates a multi-component galactic\npotential, modeling the influence of the surrounding stellar distribution, dark\nmatter, and hot gas with the central blackhole. Our analysis reveals that the\ninclusion of the galactic potential induces subtle yet noteworthy shifts in the\nlocations of sonic points. This effect is particularly pronounced in the\nvertical equilibrium disc model, where the region allowing for shock formation\nundergoes significant modification. The nature of critical points is determined\nby analyzing the eigenvalues of the corresponding stability matrix,\nestablishing that multi-transonicity is restricted to a finite range of angular\nmomentum. Shock strength and associated dynamic \\& thermodynamic\nquantities-such as mach number, pressure, density and temperature-are found to\nvary sensitively with galactic parameters, and are illustrated through\ncomprehensive parametric plots. Additionally, a time-dependent linear\nperturbation analysis, demonstrates that the governing perturbation equations\nretain their structural form even in the presence of a galactic potential. The\nflows remain stable under adiabatic, radially propagating perturbations.\nInterestingly, the perturbative framework naturally gives rise to an emergent\nacoustic metric, identifying the system as a classical analogue of gravity. The\ncorresponding acoustic surface gravity is analytically derived and shown to\nexhibit a dependence on both the spin of the black hole and the characteristics\nof the surrounding galactic environment."}

The SED is heavily\ninfluenced not only by evolutionary stage, but also the morphology of the young\nstar. This work is part of the NEMESIS project which is aiming to revisit star\nformation with the aid of machine learning techniques and provides the\nframework for this work. In a first effort towards a novel\nspectro-morphological classification we analyzed young stellar object\nmorphologies and linked them to the currently used observational classes.\nThereby we aim to lay the foundation for a spectro-morphological\nclassification, and apply the insights learned in this study in a future,\nrevisited classification scheme. We obtained archival high-resolution survey\nimages from VISTA for approximately 10,000 literature young stellar object\ncandidates towards the Orion star formation complex (OSFC). Utilizing a\nSelf-Organizing map (SOM) algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning method,\nwe created a grid of morphological prototypes from near- and mid-infrared\nimages. Furthermore, we determined which prototypes are most representative of\nthe different observational classes, derived from the infrared spectral index,\nvia Bayesian inference. We present our grids of morphological prototypes of\nyoung stellar objects in the near-infrared, which were created purely from\nobservational data. They are thus non-dependent on theoretical models. In\naddition, we show maps that indicate the probability for a prototype belonging\nto any of the observational classes. We find that SOMs created from\nnear-infrared images are a useful tool, with limitations, to identify\ncharacteristic morphologies of young stellar objects in different evolutionary\nstages. This first step lays the foundation for a spectro-morphological\nclassification of young stellar objects to be developed in the future."}

In constructing an\nalgorithm of the optimal selection of targets for these observations and in\ncomparing the detection efficiencies for several telescopes, we considered\nmodels of the night-sky brightness that satisfy the data of infrared\nobservations carried out in 2011 with the Optical Gravitational Lensing\nExperiment (OGLE) telescope and the RoboNet telescopes (FTS, FTN, and LT) used\nto search for planets with the microlensing method. The considered models of\nthe night-sky brightness can be used for various observations (not only\nmicrolensing events). The time intervals, during which microlensing events can\nbe observed, were determined with accounting for the positions of the Sun and\nthe Moon and the other constraints on the telescope pointing. Our algorithm\nallows us to determine the already known microlensing events that are\naccessible for observation with a particular telescope and to select targets,\nfor which the probability of detecting an exoplanet is maximal. The events,\nwhich would maximize the probability of detecting exoplanets, were selected for\nobservations. The probability of detecting an exoplanet is usually proportional\nto the mirror diameter of a telescope. Telescopes with a wider field of view,\nsuch as the OGLE, are more effective in finding new microlensing events. To\nobserve different microlensing events, it is usually better to use different\nnearby telescopes. However, all such telescopes are often better to use for\nobserving the same event in those relatively short time intervals that\ncorrespond to the peak brightness of the event."}

The most promising solution to this puzzle is that some massive\nstars experience O-C shell mergers boosting their yields through dynamic,\nconvective-reactive nucleosynthesis. We report how convective macro physics\nbased on 3D $4\\pi$ hydrodynamic simulations impacts production in the O shell\nby post-processing the $\\mathrm{M_{ZAMS}}=15~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ $Z=0.02$ model\nfrom the NuGrid dataset. We explore a mixing downturn, boosted velocities,\nreduced ingestion rate, and convective quenching. Across 24 mixing cases, the\npre-explosive yields for [P/Fe], [Cl/Fe], [K/Fe], and [Sc/Fe] are modified by\n$[-0.33,0.23]~\\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.84,0.64]~\\mathrm{dex}$,\n$[-0.78,1.48]~\\mathrm{dex}$, and $[-0.36,1.29]~\\mathrm{dex}$, respectively.\nCases with a convective downturn with the fastest ingestion rate have the\nlargest enhancement, and production is non-monotonic with boosted velocities.\nWhich reactions are most important for the convective-reactive element\nproduction pathways depends on the mixing. We parameterize production of\n$^{40}\\mathrm{K}$ ($t_{1/2} = 1.248~\\mathrm{Gyr}$), an important radiogenic\nheat source for younger ($2{-}3~\\mathrm{Gyr}$) rocky planets and find a yield\nvariation exceeding three orders of magnitude. This range of initial abundances\nfor $^{40}\\mathrm{K}$ implies the early geodynamic behaviour of silicate\nmantles in rocky planets can differ greatly from that of Earth. These results\nunderscore the importance of investigating the 3D macro physics of shell merger\nconvection through hydrodynamic simulations to develop a predictive\nunderstanding of the origin and variability of the light odd-Z elements and the\n$^{40}\\mathrm{K}/\\mathrm{K}$ ratio in planet host stars."}

The\npresent paper aims to analyse the properties of groups in various evolutionary\nstages (FGs, \"almost\" FGs, and non-FGs), and to increase the sample of FG\ncandidates. We have spectroscopically observed galaxies in four groups and ten\ncandidate FGs detected in the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. We\nsearched for substructures by applying the Serna-Gerbal dendrogram method to\nanalyse the dynamical structure of each group. By applying the FIREFLY software\nto the continuum and PIPE_VIS to the emission lines, we derived the stellar\npopulation properties in various regions for each group. A roughly continuous\nvariation in properties is found between a group that is still building up\n(XCLASS 1330), a well-formed massive group (MCG+00-27-023), a dynamically\ncomplex non-FG (NGC 4065), and a near-FG (NGC 4104). We also optically confirm\ntwo FGs in the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, but their X-ray\nluminosity is still unknown. We observe that the lower the mass of the\nsubstructure, the more recent the stellar population in the considered groups.\nWe also show an apparent lack of high-mass substructures for low-metallicity\nsystems. These results are consistent with the generally adopted model of\nenergy transfer during interactions of the galaxies with the group and cluster\npotential wells. Furthermore, the fossil status of a group might be related to\nthe large-scale environment. Therefore, studying the positions of non-FGs,\nnear-FGs, and FGs within the cosmic web can provide insights into the process\nof how fossil systems come into being in the Universe."}
