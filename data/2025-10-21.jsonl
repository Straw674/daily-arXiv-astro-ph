After being accelerated at supernova remnant shocks, CRs propagate\nthrough the interstellar medium (ISM), establishing smooth large-scale\ndistributions and driving galactic outflows. The efficiency of this feedback is\ncontrolled by the effective transport speed of the CR population, which in turn\ndepends on the competition between CR-driven plasma instabilities and wave\ndamping processes that vary strongly with ISM phase. In cold, dense gas,\nion-neutral damping dominates, whereas in warm, diffuse environments, weaker\nnon-linear Landau damping prevails, leading to enhanced CR scattering and\nslower transport. To investigate these effects, we employ the moving-mesh code\nArepo and model CR transport using a two-moment description within the\nmultiphase ISM framework Crisp, which self-consistently computes CR diffusion\ncoefficients and transport velocities from coarse-grained plasma physics. The\nintrinsic CR diffusion coefficient depends inversely on the scattering rate of\nCRs and Alfv\\'en waves, covering 15 orders of magnitude. In contrast, we show\nthat the effective CR diffusion coefficient, which quantifies the propagation\nspeed of CRs through the ISM, converges toward the canonical range of\n$10^{28}$-$10^{29}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$. Simulations with only non-linear Landau\ndamping yield transport rates up to an order of magnitude slower than those\nincluding both Landau and ion-neutral damping. Overall, CR transport speeds\nincrease systematically with gas density, for which we provide a\ndensity-dependent fit of the effective CR diffusion coefficient.

One such type of variability study, called reverberation\nmapping (RM), established that the dominant source of infrared radiation from\nan active galactic nucleus (AGN) was from dust absorption and re-emission,\nwhich demonstrated that the optical brightening and fading of light from the\naccretion disk (AD) around a supermassive black hole was followed by a\ncorresponding (delayed) variation at infrared (IR) wavelengths from the\nsurrounding dust distribution. Since that time a great deal more has been\nlearned about the dust distribution around ADs, both near the AD in the form of\na potential torus, as well as extended emission in the form of polar dust\noutflows. Understanding the dust distribution is vital to understanding how\nAGNs affect their host galaxy as well as the overall energetics of AGNs as ~50%\nof energy from an AGN comes out in the IR. Dust RM has been done exclusively in\nthe near-IR (1-5 microns) which traces the inner edge of the dust near the dust\nsublimation radius. Hence extending RM to the mid-IR, especially to the peak of\nthe dust emission between 25 and 30 microns, allows for an examination of the\ndust distribution around ADs and potentially traces the source of the polar\noutflow. RM with the proposed PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics\n(PRIMA) can focus on variability monitoring of a sample of low- to\nhigh-luminosity AGNs to trace the 25-30 microns emission that is reverberated\nfrom the UV/optical AD emission which will be monitored by other space and\nground-based observatories and made available to PRIMA users. Then, by detailed\nmodeling of the response of the dust emission to shorter wavelengths, the\ndistribution of the dust around an AGN will be revealed and can be linked to\nthe accretion disk luminosities."}

The most\nrecent lattice simulations have questioned the validity of this regime, showing\nexamples characterized by a rapid increase in the inflaton gradient energy and\nthe breakdown of homogeneous backreaction. We compute this energy density\nperturbatively within the assumption of homogeneous backreaction, obtaining\nexamples with a detectable SGWB and with an inflaton gradient energy that\nremains subdominant to the inflaton zero-mode kinetic energy throughout\ninflation."}

However, the rarity of transient\nevents and the extensive human labeling required for a large number of samples\npose significant challenges in constructing training datasets for RB\nclassification. Given these challenges, point source injection techniques,\nwhich inject simulated point sources into optical images, provide a promising\nsolution. This paper presents the first detailed comparison of different point\nsource injection strategies and their effects on classification performance\nwithin a simulation-to-reality framework. To this end, we first construct\nvarious training datasets based on Random Injection (RI), Near Galaxy Injection\n(NGI), and a combined approach by using the Korea Microlensing Telescope\nNetwork datasets. Subsequently, we train convolutional neural networks on\nsimulated cutout samples and evaluate them on real, imbalanced datasets from\ngravitational wave follow-up observations for GW190814 and S230518h. Extensive\nexperimental results show that RI excels at asteroid detection and bogus\nfiltering but underperforms on transients occurring near galaxies (e.g.,\nsupernovae). In contrast, NGI is effective for detecting transients near\ngalaxies but tends to misclassify variable stars as transients, resulting in a\nhigh false positive rate. The combined approach effectively handles these\ntrade-offs, thereby balancing between detection rate and false positive rate.\nOur results emphasize the importance of point source injection strategy in\ndeveloping robust RB classifiers for transient (or multi-messenger) follow-up\ncampaigns."}

Conversely, in aligned axion inflation,\ninflation can proceed along trajectories emerging from near a saddle point of\nthe two-field potential and ending through an instability in the orthogonal\ndirection. Such solutions satisfy present observational limits and will be\ntested by future CMB experiments. Previous studies have suggested the\npossibility of two distinct inflationary stages separated by a transition\ncharacterized by rapid oscillations of the fields. In this work, we demonstrate\nthat the existence of these two stages is a generic feature of the model. We\nexplore a possible phenomenological signature of the transition when a U(1)\ngauge field is coupled to the axions, namely, the production of gravitational\nwaves (GWs) sourced by gauge quanta generated during the transition. This\nmechanism produces a feature similar to those seen in spectator axion models or\naxion inflation with appropriate potentials, i.e. a strongly scale-dependent\npower spectrum. The scale at which the GW spectrum is produced is determined by\nthe duration of the second inflationary phase. Consequently, the spectrum may\npeak at different frequencies, potentially detectable by future GW experiments."}

We present\ndata taken with the MIRC-X and MYSTIC instruments at the CHARA Array on the Hot\nJupiter Upsilon Andromedae b. By resolving the star-planet system, we attempt\nto directly detect the flux from the planet. We describe our self-calibration\nmethods for modeling systematics in the closure phase data, which allows us to\nreach sub-degree precision. Through combining multiple nights of data across\ntwo MIRC-X runs in 2019 and 2021, we achieved a very tentative detection of Ups\nAnd b in the H-band at a planet/star contrast of 2-3 x 10^-4. Unfortunately, we\ncannot confirm this detection with 2021 MYSTIC data in the K-band, or in a 2023\njoint MIRC-X and MYSTIC dataset. We run updated global circulation models and\ncreate post-processed spectra for this planet, and report the resulting model\nspectra in H- and K-bands as a function of orbital phase. We then run planetary\ninjection tests to explore H/K-band contrast limits, and find that we can\nconfidently recover planets down to a planet/star contrast of 1-2 x 10^-4. We\nshow that we are probing contrasts fainter than predicted by the model, making\nour non-detection surprising.

Our results point to the existence of two types\nof star-forming galaxies that follow different evolutionary paths: HSD disks\nare very efficient in converting gas into stars, perhaps thanks to the\nefficient formation of non-axisymmetric structures (bars and spiral arms),\nwhereas LSD disks are not. The HSD-LSD dichotomy is absent in the baryonic\nTully-Fisher relation ($M_{\\rm bar}$ versus flat circular velocity $V_{\\rm f}$)\nbut moderately seen in the angular-momentum relation (approximately $M_{\\rm\nbar}$ versus $V_{\\rm f}\\times R_{\\rm 50, bar}$), so it is driven by variations\nin $R_{\\rm 50, bar}$ at fixed $M_{\\rm bar}$. This fact suggests that the\nbaryonic mass-size relation is the most effective empirical tool to distinguish\ndifferent galaxy types and study their evolution."}

This phenomenon, known as the (inverse)\nGertsenshtein effect, is typically analyzed in Minkowski spacetime, neglecting\nthe spacetime curvature induced by the magnetic field itself. This paper\ninvestigates, for the first time, the influence of spacetime curvature on the\n(inverse) Gertsenshtein effect. To this end, we first determine the metric\nperturbation from Minkowski spacetime up to second order in the magnetic field\nstrength, assuming cylindrical symmetry. We also discuss the ambiguities in the\nform of the metric perturbation arising from gauge freedom and boundary\nconditions. Using the geometric optics approximation, we then derive a set of\ncoupled equations governing the propagation of electromagnetic and\ngravitational waves in the resulting curved spacetime. These equations are\nsolved for two specific scenarios: a plane wave and a spherical wave. From the\nsolutions, we compute the evolution of the wave amplitudes and the associated\nenergy fluxes. Our analysis reveals that two competing effects govern the\namplitude evolution: magnification due to the focusing of waves by spacetime\ncurvature, and attenuation due to wave conversion via the Gertsenshtein effect.\nIn the plane wave case, these effects precisely cancel, resulting in no net\nchange in amplitude. In contrast, for the spherical wave, the Gertsenshtein\neffect dominates over focusing, leading to an overall reduction in amplitude."}

The sensitive NOEMA imaging at\n1.6 kpc resolution reveals extended dust emission, ~14 kpc in diameter (r_e~2.5\nkpc, b/a=0.5), that is centrally asymmetric and clumpy. The dust emission is as\nextended as the stellar emission and the molecular gas traced by CO(2-1), with\na common center, and is brightest in the strongly-obscured nuclear part of the\ngalaxy. Approximately one-third of the total dust emission emerges from the\nnucleus and the most prominent clump to the south, and (only) 60% from the\ncentral 3.5x1.5 kpc (0.5\"-0.2\"), implying that the starburst is very extended.\nThe combined JWST and NOEMA morphology suggests GN20 experienced a recent\ninteraction or merger, likely invigorating the starburst. The radial surface\nbrightness profiles of the molecular gas and near-IR stellar emission are\nsimilar, while in contrast, the dust emission appears significantly more\nconcentrated. Through self-consistent radiative transfer modeling of the\nintegrated and resolved CO and dust emission, we derive an\n$M_{mol}=2.9^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\\times10^{11}$ Msun with\n$\\alpha_{CO}=2.8^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$.

The latter highlights the importance of accounting for radiative\ntransfer effects when comparing molecular gas and dust distributions from\ndifferent tracers."}

In addition, we determine the Ba abundances from the Ba II\nsubordinate lines, which are almost independent of F_odd.

We present results of such a search using data from the first\nobserving run through the first portion of the fourth observing run of the\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaborations. We apply gravitational-wave radiometer\ntechniques to generate skymaps and search for both narrowband and broadband\npersistent gravitational-wave sources. Additionally, we use spherical harmonic\ndecomposition to probe spatially extended sources. No evidence of persistent\ngravitational-wave signals is found, and we set the most stringent constraints\nto date on such emissions. For narrowband point sources, our sensitivity\nestimate to effective strain amplitude lies in the range $(0.03 - 8.4) \\times\n10^{-24}$ across all sky and frequency range $(20 - 160)$ Hz. For targeted\nsources -- Scorpius X-1, SN 1987A, the Galactic Center, Terzan 5, and NGC 6397\n-- we constrain the strain amplitude with best limits ranging from $\\sim 1.1\n\\times 10^{-25}$ to $6.5 \\times 10^{-24}$.

We\ninvestigated observed LGRBs and the properties of their host galaxies to\nconstrain this metallicity dependence. In order to compute LGRB rates we\nmodelled the cosmic history of star formation, as a function of host galaxy\nmetallicity and stellar mass, and added a LGRB efficiency function that can\ninclude various shapes including abrupt cutoffs and more gradual variations in\nthe GRB yield with metallicity. In contrast to previous work, this model\nincludes scatters in the relations between mass, metallicity, and star\nformation rate, as well as a scatter in the metallicity distribution inside\ngalaxies. We then varied both the threshold value and shape, and compared it to\nobserved LGRBs and the properties of their host galaxies. In our model a sharp\ncutoff at an oxygen abundance $Z_{\\text{O/H}}=12+\\log(\\text{O/H})=8.6\\pm0.1$\n(corresponding to $\\sim0.6Z_{\\odot}$) provides the best explanation for the\nobserved LGRB data.

This noise\nis unavoidable in the presence of the residual angular movement of satellites,\nmovable optical subassemblies (MOSAs), and test masses (TMs), and needs to be\nsubtracted after reducing the first two types of noises using time-delay\ninterferometry (TDI). Previous works have shown that TTL coupling coefficients\ncan be estimated from the null TDI channel $\\zeta$ and used for noise\nsubtraction in other combinations. However, it was found that correlated MOSA\nyaw jitters have a negative impact on the TTL calibration, and the effects of\nrealistic residual angular jitters from drag-free and pointing control (DFPC)\nare yet to be investigated. In this paper, we use closed-loop DFPC simulations\nto generate more realistic jitters in the science mode and test TTL calibration\ncapability. Our simulations reveal that rotating only one MOSA is more\nfavorable, compared to symmetrically rotating two MOSAs, for enhancing the\naccuracy of TTL coefficient estimation, while employing only high-frequency\ndata (0.1 - 1 Hz).

In the warm corona scenario, SE originates from\nupscattered disk photons and should therefore correlate strongly with UV\nemission. Conversely, in the ionized reflection scenario, SE arises from the\nillumination of the accretion disk by the hot corona and should primarily\ncorrelate with the hard X-ray primary continuum (PC). In this second paper of\nthe series, we investigate the correlations among SE, UV and PC, leveraging a\nsample of 59 unobscured type 1 AGNs compiled in \\citet{Chen+2025a}. Our\nextensive analysis reveals a strong intrinsic correlation between SE and UV\nthat remains robust after controlling for PC ($p_\\mathrm{null}\\lesssim\n10^{-7}$). In contrast, the correlation between SE and PC is weaker but still\nstatistically significant ($p_\\mathrm{null}\\lesssim 5\\times 10^{-2}$). These\nfindings suggest that, in addition to ionized reflection -- a natural outcome\nof the hot corona illuminating the disk -- a warm corona component is\nessential, and may even dominate, in producing the soft excess. Additionally,\nwe report a mild anti-correlation between SE strength ($q$) and PC photon index\n($\\Gamma_\\mathrm{PC}$) ($p_\\mathrm{null}=10^{-2}$), suggesting a potential\ncompetition between the warm and hot coronae.

The sensitive NOEMA imaging at\n1.6 kpc resolution reveals extended dust emission, ~14 kpc in diameter (r_e~2.5\nkpc, b/a=0.5), that is centrally asymmetric and clumpy. The dust emission is as\nextended as the stellar emission and the molecular gas traced by CO(2-1), with\na common center, and is brightest in the strongly-obscured nuclear part of the\ngalaxy. Approximately one-third of the total dust emission emerges from the\nnucleus and the most prominent clump to the south, and (only) 60% from the\ncentral 3.5x1.5 kpc (0.5\"-0.2\"), implying that the starburst is very extended.\nThe combined JWST and NOEMA morphology suggests GN20 experienced a recent\ninteraction or merger, likely invigorating the starburst. The radial surface\nbrightness profiles of the molecular gas and near-IR stellar emission are\nsimilar, while in contrast, the dust emission appears significantly more\nconcentrated.

One such type of variability study, called reverberation\nmapping (RM), established that the dominant source of infrared radiation from\nan active galactic nucleus (AGN) was from dust absorption and re-emission,\nwhich demonstrated that the optical brightening and fading of light from the\naccretion disk (AD) around a supermassive black hole was followed by a\ncorresponding (delayed) variation at infrared (IR) wavelengths from the\nsurrounding dust distribution. Since that time a great deal more has been\nlearned about the dust distribution around ADs, both near the AD in the form of\na potential torus, as well as extended emission in the form of polar dust\noutflows. Understanding the dust distribution is vital to understanding how\nAGNs affect their host galaxy as well as the overall energetics of AGNs as ~50%\nof energy from an AGN comes out in the IR. Dust RM has been done exclusively in\nthe near-IR (1-5 microns) which traces the inner edge of the dust near the dust\nsublimation radius. Hence extending RM to the mid-IR, especially to the peak of\nthe dust emission between 25 and 30 microns, allows for an examination of the\ndust distribution around ADs and potentially traces the source of the polar\noutflow. RM with the proposed PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics\n(PRIMA) can focus on variability monitoring of a sample of low- to\nhigh-luminosity AGNs to trace the 25-30 microns emission that is reverberated\nfrom the UV/optical AD emission which will be monitored by other space and\nground-based observatories and made available to PRIMA users. Then, by detailed\nmodeling of the response of the dust emission to shorter wavelengths, the\ndistribution of the dust around an AGN will be revealed and can be linked to\nthe accretion disk luminosities."}

New constraints on the synchrotron spectral index using a semi-blind component separation method", "categories": ["astro-ph.CO", "astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "15 pages, 15 figures, 1 table, submitted in A&A", "summary": "We introduce a novel approach to estimate the spectral index, $\\beta_s$, of\npolarised synchrotron emission, combining the moment expansion of CMB\nforegrounds and the constrained-ILC method. We reconstruct the maps of the\nfirst two synchrotron moments, combining multi-frequency data, and apply the\n`T-T plot' technique between two moment maps to estimate the synchrotron\nspectral index. This approach offers a new technique for mapping the foreground\nspectral parameters, complementing the model-based parametric component\nseparation methods. Applying this technique, we derive a new constraint on the\nspectral index of polarised synchrotron emission using QUIJOTE MFI wide-survey\n11 and 13 GHz data, Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data at K and\nKa bands, and Planck LFI 30 GHz data. In the Galactic plane and North Polar\nSpur regions, we obtain an inverse-variance-weighted mean synchrotron index of\n$\\beta_s = -3.11$ with a standard deviation of $0.21$ due to intrinsic scatter,\nconsistent with previous results based on parametric methods using the same\ndataset. We find that the inverse-variance-weighted mean spectral index,\nincluding both statistical and systematic uncertainties, is $\\beta_s^{\\rm\nplane} = -3.05 \\pm 0.01$ in the Galactic plane and $\\beta_s^{\\rm\nhigh\\text{-}lat} = -3.13 \\pm 0.02$ at high latitudes, indicating a moderate\nsteepening of the spectral index from low to high Galactic latitudes. Our\nanalysis indicates that, within the current upper limit on the AME polarisation\nfraction, our results are not subject to any appreciable bias. Furthermore, we\ninfer the spectral index over the entire QUIJOTE survey region, partitioning\nthe sky into 21 patches. This technique can be further extended to constrain\nthe synchrotron spectral curvature by reconstructing higher-order moments when\nbetter-quality data become available."}
