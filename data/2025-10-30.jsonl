(2) is there a generic 'missing dwarfs' problem in LambdaCDM\npredictions when all environments - and not just satellites around Milky Way\nlike galaxies - are considered? The depth of the observational data used here\nenables us to construct complete, unbiased samples of galaxies, down to Mstar ~\n10^7 MSun and out to z ~ 0.4. Strong environmental differences are found for\nthe galaxy stellar mass function when considering distance from LSS. As we move\ncloser to LSS, the dwarf mass function becomes progressively flatter and the\nknee of the mass function shifts to larger stellar masses, both of which result\nin a higher ratio of massive to dwarf galaxies.

Measuring PMs of low-luminosity systems is difficult due to\nthe low number of member stars, requiring a precise inertial reference frame.\nWe construct reference frames using three different sets of external sources:\n1) stars with Gaia DR3 data, 2) stationary background galaxies, and 3) a\ncombination of the two.

Further spatially\nresolved inspection reveals that this short and intense kinetic AGN feedback\ncan only suppress the star formation within 1-2 kpc, resulting in this\nsize-dependent effect of quenching. We also identify a long-term effect of a\nfew Gyr timescale that the gas inflow rate is progressively suppressed after\ntriggering kinetic feedback, which appears to effectively quench large galaxies\nentirely.

The timing residuals of\neach pulsar are an integrated measure of the gravitational-wave power across\nall angular scales. However, due to the limited number of monitored pulsars,\ncurrent analyses are only able to reconstruct the angular structure of the\nbackground at large scales. We show analytically that this mismatch between the\nintegrated all-sky signal and the truncated reconstruction introduces a\npreviously unaccounted source of systematic bias in anisotropic background map\nreconstruction. The source of this systematic error, that we call ''small-scale\nleakage'', is the intrinsic presence of unaccounted gravitational wave power at\nscales smaller than the reconstructed scales. This unmodeled power leaks into\nlarge-scale modes, artificially increasing the recovered value of the inferred\nangular power spectrum by at least one order of magnitude in a wide range of\nscales. Importantly, this effect is fundamentally independent of the geometry\nof the pulsar configuration, the anisotropy reconstruction method, the use of\ndifferent regularization schemes, and the presence of pulsar noise. As the\nquality of pulsar timing array experiments improves, a robust understanding of\nsmall-scale leakage will become paramount for reliable detection and\ncharacterization of the gravitational wave background.

Our analysis is largely independent of previous\nphotometric redshift calibrations and, thus, provides an important cross-check\nin light of recent cosmological tensions. Overall, we find excellent agreement\nwith previously published results on the DES Y3 and HSC Y1 data sets while\nthere are some differences on the mean redshift with respect to the previously\npublished KiDS-1000 results. We attribute the latter to mismatches in\nphotometric noise properties in the COSMOS field compared to the wider KiDS\nSOM-gold catalog. At the same time, the new $n(z)$ estimates for KiDS do not\nsignificantly change estimates of cosmic structure growth from cosmic shear.\nFinally, we discuss how our method can be applied to future weak lensing\ncalibrations with DESI data."}

Current exoplanet surveys are focused on detecting small exoplanets\norbiting in the liquid-water habitable zones of their host stars. Despite the\nrecent significant advancements in instrumental developments, the current\nlimitation in detecting these exoplanets is the intrinsic variability of the\nhost star itself. Aims. Our aim is to use the full CARMENES guaranteed time\nobservations (GTO) data set spanning more than 8 years of observations of over\n350 stars to investigate the wavelength dependence of high-precision radial\nvelocities (RV), as stellar activity features should exhibit a wavelength\ndependence while the RV variation due to an orbiting planet will be wavelength\nindependent. Methods. We use the chromatic index (CRX) to quantify the slope of\nthe measured RVs as a function of logarithmic wavelength. We investigate the\ndependence of the CRX in the full CARMENES GTO sample on 24 stellar activity\nindices in the visible and near-infrared channels of the CARMENES spectrograph\nand each star's stellar parameters. We also present an updated convective\nturnover time scaling for the calculation of the stellar Rossby number for M\ndwarfs. Results. Our results show that approximately 17\\% of GTO stars show a\nstrong or a moderate correlation between CRX and RV. We can improve the\nmeasured RVs by a factor of up to nearly 4 in rms by subtracting the RV\npredicted by the CRX-RV correlation from the measured RVs.

The timing residuals of\neach pulsar are an integrated measure of the gravitational-wave power across\nall angular scales. However, due to the limited number of monitored pulsars,\ncurrent analyses are only able to reconstruct the angular structure of the\nbackground at large scales. We show analytically that this mismatch between the\nintegrated all-sky signal and the truncated reconstruction introduces a\npreviously unaccounted source of systematic bias in anisotropic background map\nreconstruction. The source of this systematic error, that we call ''small-scale\nleakage'', is the intrinsic presence of unaccounted gravitational wave power at\nscales smaller than the reconstructed scales. This unmodeled power leaks into\nlarge-scale modes, artificially increasing the recovered value of the inferred\nangular power spectrum by at least one order of magnitude in a wide range of\nscales. Importantly, this effect is fundamentally independent of the geometry\nof the pulsar configuration, the anisotropy reconstruction method, the use of\ndifferent regularization schemes, and the presence of pulsar noise.

We show that the screening mechanism of the asymmetron\ninside dense objects induces a surface tension associated with the boundary of\nthe screening object, leading to a richer class of bubble solutions than the\nstandard Coleman-Callan bulk nucleation. These boundary surface tensions are\nused to modify the Nambu-Goto action for instantons, allowing for the\ncomputation of the corresponding Euclidean action for bubbles nucleating on\nflat planes, as well as on concave and convex cylindrical surfaces. We find\nthat the smallest Euclidean action occurs for bubbles nucleating along the edge\nof a concave spherical surface. Comparing this edge nucleation channel with the\nbulk one, we determine the maximum curvature radius for which concave edge\nnucleation is preferred. Since the maximum radius of curvature is exponentially\nsuppressed by the action of a bulk bubble, we find that within the regime of\nthe instanton approximation, edge nucleation is always preferred. This is\nlargely due to the weak couplings of the asymmetron. We apply these findings to\ndetermine the maximum curvature radius of a cosmic void and discuss how our\nresults affect the seeding of $N$-body simulations of asymmetron domains,\nshowing that domain wall nucleation preferentially occurs at the edges of\ncosmological voids.

We detect multiple nebular emission lines from NIRSpec IFS data. We\nidentify a robust broad component of [O III]$\\lambda5008$ emission, indicating\nthe presence of ionized gas outflows. The derived gas depletion time of a few\nhundred Myr implies that our target could be one of the progenitors of massive\nquiescent galaxies at $z\\sim4-5$ identified by recent JWST observations. The\nspatial distribution of optical and far-infrared (FIR) [O III] emission lines\ndiffers in morphology, likely resulting from different critical densities and\ninhomogeneous density distributions within the galaxy. Potential old stellar\npopulations may be necessary to account for the derived metallicity of\n$\\sim0.2\\,\\rm{Z}_\\odot$, and their presence can be confirmed by future MIRI\nobservations. Including our target, star-forming galaxies at $z>6$ detected by\nALMA are generally very young but more massive and brighter in UV than galaxies\nidentified by only JWST. The ALMA-detected galaxies may also have a steeper\nmass-metallicity relation. These findings suggest that the ALMA-detected\ngalaxies may have experienced more efficient mass assembly processes in their\nevolutionary pathways."}

With those,\nwe perform a systematic analysis of the group's dynamics in the core and its\nembedding in the local cosmic environment. Our analysis confirms that the\nsatellite galaxies of the M81 complex exhibit a flattened, planar distribution\nalmost perpendicular to the supergalactic pole and thus aligned with a\nlarger-scale filamentary structure in the Local Universe. We demonstrate that\nthe properties of the group's barycentre are robustly constrained by the two\nbrightest members, M81 and M82, and that correcting heliocentric velocities for\nthe solar motion in the Local Group decreases the velocity dispersion of the\ngroup. Then applying minor and major infall models, we fit the local Hubble\nflow to constrain the Hubble Constant and the total mass of the M81 complex.\nThe joint best-fit parameters from both models yield $H_0 = \\left(63 \\pm 6\n\\right)$ km/s/Mpc and total mass of $(2.28\\pm 0.49) \\times 10^{12} M_{\\odot}$.\nWe thus arrive at an increased mass estimate compared to prior work but reach a\nhigher consistency with virial, $(2.74 \\pm 0.36)\\times 10^{12}\\,M_\\odot$, and\nprojected-mass estimates, $(3.11 \\pm 0.69)\\times 10^{12} M_\\odot$.

The logN-logS measured in cycles 8+9 are consistent with those measured\nin the previous cycle 5+6 NuSTAR NEP survey, but in a larger area (0.3 deg^2\ncompared with 0.19 deg^2). The slope of the cycles 8+9 8-24 keV logN-logS curve\nis flatter than other works ({\\alpha}89 = 1.13 +/- 0.46), but is consistent\nwith the Euclidean value of {\\alpha} = 1.50.

Extending previous analyses of precession resonances to 0.5\npost-Newtonian order, we incorporate quadrupolar magnetic tidal moments, which\nhave no Newtonian counterpart. Averaging the Hamiltonian over the inner orbit,\nwe find that magnetic tides introduce new resonances absent at lower order,\nleading to additional eccentricity excitations and significantly modifying the\nbinary's long-term evolution. Numerical solutions of the Lagrange Planetary\nEquations confirm these analytical predictions and reveal how resonance\nstrength depends on orbital eccentricity and inclination. The resulting\ndynamics accelerates the binary merger and imprint distinctive signatures on\ngravitational waves, potentially observable by LISA. Our findings identify\nmagnetic tidal coupling as a novel strong-gravity effect and establish its\nimportance for the resonant dynamics of compact-object binaries near SMBHs."}

Its previous work is about forward shock\n  (https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14715v1)", "summary": "The origin of radio afterglows or delayed radio flares in tidal disruption\nevents (TDEs) is not fully understood. They could be generated either by a\nforward shock (FS) propagating into diffuse circumnuclear medium (CNM), or a\nbow shock (BS) around a dense cloud, each of which is fundamentally different.\nTo elucidate the distinctions between these two scenarios, we conducted\ntwo-fluid simulations incorporating relativistic electrons to investigate the\nspatial evolution of these electrons after being accelerated by shock. Based on\ntheir spatial distribution, we performed radiative transfer calculations to\nobtain the synchrotron spectra. In Paper I (Mou 2025), we reported the results\nfor the FS scenario; in this article, we focus on the BS scenario. Compared to\nthat from the FS, the radio emission from the BS exhibits a higher peak\nfrequency, and its flux shows a much steeper rise and a more rapid decline. The\nradio flux from the BS also responds to fluctuations in the outflow. The\ncombined effects of the BS and FS substantially alter radio spectra, causing\nsignificant deviations from the single-zone emission model, and in some cases\nproducing double-peaked or flat-top features in spectra. This study highlights\nthe importance of the BS, and inspires a novel approach for probing dense gas\non sub-parsec scales in galactic nuclei by decomposing the BS radio spectrum to\nreveal the conditions of circumnuclear dense gas."}

Pre-referee version, comments\n  are appreciated", "summary": "Aims. eROSITA on board of the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG) spacecraft\nperformed its first X-ray all-sky survey (eRASS1) between December 2019 and\nJune 2020. It detected about 930000 sources, providing us with an unprecedented\nopportunity for a detailed blazar census. We present the properties of blazars\nand blazar candidates in eRASS1 and the compilation of the eROSITA blazar\ncatalog. Methods. We compile a list of blazar and blazar candidates from the\nliterature and match it with the eRASS1 catalog, creating the Blazars in eRASS1\n(BlazEr1) catalog. For sources with more than 50 counts we obtain their X-ray\nspectral properties. We compile multiwavelength data from the radio to the\ngamma-ray regimes for all sources, including multiwavelength spectral indices\nand redshifts. The full catalog is available online. Results. We present the\nBlazEr1 catalog, containing 5865 sources, of which 2106 are associated with\nconfirmed blazars. For 3668 sources, eROSITA provides the first X-ray data. The\ncontamination from non-blazar sources of the entire sample is less than 11%.\nMost candidates exhibit properties typical for blazars. We present properties\nof the entire X-ray detected blazar population, including the distributions of\nX-ray luminosities and photon indices, multiwavelength properties, and the\nblazar log N-log S distribution. Our catalog provides follow up targets, such\nas potential MeV and TeV blazars. Conclusions. The BlazEr1 catalog provides a\ncompilation of X-ray detected blazars and blazar candidates. The catalog serves\nas a starting point for exploiting further eROSITA surveys using the same\nmethodology, enabling us to study the X-ray variability and a large number of\nspectral energy distributions of blazars in the future."}

This paradigm has recently been challenged by the\nidentification of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies, thought to be young\nactive galactic nuclei with low-mass black holes, harboring relativistic jets.\nAmong them, sources hosting $>$100 kpc radio jets are extremely rare. Here, we\nreport the discovery of large-scale, double-lobed radio structures in 33 NLSy1s\nwith the projected linear size of at least 100 kpc from a recently published\ncatalog of 22656 NLSy1 galaxies. These 33 include 29 confirmed double-lobed\nsources and 4 candidates whose radio structure requires further study. We\nsuggest that their low black hole masses are unlikely to be due to their small\nangles of inclination to the line of sight. These enigmatic sources were\nidentified by examining the radio observations taken with the Faint Images of\nthe Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters, Very Large Array Sky Survey, Low Frequency\nArray, and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey. Among them, the NLSy1 source\nJ1318+2626 ($z=0.62$) is found to host a radio jet with the projected linear\nsize of 4.3 Mpc, making it the only NLSy1 galaxy hosting a Mpc-scale radio jet\nknown as of today. We conclude that future observations of NLSy1 sources with\nthe next generation of sensitive telescopes may reveal a much larger population\nharboring large-scale jets, thus providing crucial clues on their origin,\npropagation, and interaction with the ambient environment."}
