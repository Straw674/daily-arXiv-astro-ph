A self-consistency constraint hence arises, such that\nthe resulting orbital decay timescales must be longer than the lifetimes of the\nsystems in question. While such constraints are often trivially passed, the\ncombined dependencies of dynamical friction timescales on the mass and orbital\nradius of the orbital tracer and on the density and velocity dispersion of the\nassumed dark matter particles leads to the existence of a number of\nastronomical systems where such a consistency test is failed. Here, we review\ncases from stars in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, galactic bars, satellite\ngalaxies, and, particularly, the multi-period mutual orbits of the Magellanic\nClouds, as recently inferred from the star formation histories of these two\ngalaxies, as well as the nearby M81 group of galaxies, where introducing enough\ndark matter to explain observed kinematics leads to dynamical friction orbital\ndecay timescales shorter than the lifetimes of the systems in question.

In this paper we employ FIREbox, a large-volume\ncosmological simulation based on the Feedback In Realistic Environments\n(FIRE-2) physics model, to characterize the mechanisms governing galaxy\nignition in the post-reionization era. By carefully matching recently-ignited\nhalos (with stellar ages below $100$ Myr) to halos that failed to form any\nstars, we conclude that the presence of cold-dense gas and halo concentration\nhelp incite the process of galaxy formation. Concretely, we find that $100\\%$\nof recently-ignited halos experience cold-dense gas enhancements relative to\ntheir matched failed counterparts. Likewise, approximately $83\\%$ display\nenhancements in both cold-dense gas and Navarro-Frenk-White concentration\n($c_{\\rm NFW}$), while the remaining $\\sim17\\%$ exhibit enhanced cold-dense gas\ncontent and suppressed $c_{\\rm NFW}$ values.

The\nmain advantage of our FFNN model, in comparison to the Nedleaer-Mead Monte\nCarlo parameter estimator used in\n\\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}, is that the approach\nintroduced here predicts parameters in milliseconds, over 10,000 times faster\nthan the traditional method used in\n\\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}. With this in mind, the FFNN\nmodel we developed and validated in this work will be adapted for Bayesian\nuncertainty analyses and automatic analyses of NIRSpec publicly available data\nfor high redshift objects. This study establishes a robust and efficient tool\nfor probing Dark Stars and understanding their role in cosmic evolution."}

MHD turbulence can be\ndecomposed into three fundamental modes-fast, slow, and Alfv\\'en-each\ncontributing differently to the dynamics of the medium. However, characterizing\nand separating the energy fractions of these modes was challenging due to the\nlimited information available from observations. To address this difficulty, we\nuse 3D isothermal and multiphase MHD turbulence simulations to examine how mode\nenergy fractions vary under different physical conditions. Overall, we find\nthat the Alfv\\'en and slow modes carry comparable kinetic-energy fractions and\ntogether dominate the turbulent energy budget in multiphase media, while the\nfast mode contributes the smallest fraction. Relative to isothermal conditions,\nmultiphase simulations exhibit an enhanced fast-mode energy fraction. We\nfurther introduce a machine-learning-based approach that employs a conditional\nResidual Neural Network to infer these fractions directly from spectroscopic\ndata. The method leverages the fact that the three MHD modes imprint distinct\nmorphological signatures in spectroscopic maps owing to their differing\nanisotropies and compressibilities.

We also provide an overview of main results in the area of 3D NLTE\nradiation transfer and its applications to modeling diverse astrophysical\nenvironments, including FGKM type- and OBA-type stars, multi-epoch spectra of\nkilonovae, and atmospheres of rocky and gaseous exoplanets."}

Study of\nhead-tail galaxies provides us with fruitful insights into the mechanisms of\nshock waves and turbulence, as well as magnetic-field amplification and\ncosmic-ray acceleration. A recent MeerKAT observation revealed that a head-tail\ngalaxy in the galaxy cluster, Abell 3322, exhibits a peculiar ``Omega\"\nstructure in its shape. In this paper, we investigated this Omega-tail galaxy\nusing the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Australia\nTelescope Compact Array (ATCA). We found that the southern jet tends to be\nbrighter than the northern jet, with a brightness ratio of about 2. This can be\nattributed to Doppler boost and the inclination of the jets. Our broadband data\nsuggest that the radio spectrum becomes steeper along the jet propagation\ndirection, and the cosmic-ray aging model with a weak reacceleration of cosmic\nrays is preferable to explain the index profile. We further found a gradient of\nthe spectral index perpendicular to the jet propagation. We discussed the\norigin of the gradient and suggested that a shock wave along one side of the\njets is present. The resultant ram pressure as well as the backflow made at the\nearly stage of the jet may produce the tail component of this Omega-tail\ngalaxy, while the observed Omega-shape structure is more likely due to a twin\nvortex seen in the low Reynolds number flow."}

When analyzed in the context of General\nRelativity (GR), the latest DESI data favor a dynamical dark energy (DDE)\nequation of state, $w(z)$, that crosses the phantom divide line $w=-1$.\nHowever, this framework prefers a lower Hubble constant, $H_0$, than Planck\n2018, thereby worsening the tension with local measurements. This phantom\ncrossing is a key feature that cannot be achieved by minimally coupled scalar\nfields (quintessence) within GR. This suggests the need for a new degree of\nfreedom that can simultaneously: (A) increase the best-fit value of $H_0$ in\nthe context of the DESI DR2 data, and (B) allow the crossing of the $w=-1$ line\nwithin a new theoretical approach. We argue that both of these goals may be\nachieved in the context of Modified Gravity (MG), and in particular,\nScalar-Tensor (ST) theories, where phantom crossing is a natural and viable\nfeature. We demonstrate these facts by analyzing a joint dataset including DESI\nDR2, Pantheon+, CMB, and growth-rate (RSD) data in the context of simple\nparametrizations for the effective gravitational constant, $\\mu_G(z) \\equiv\nG_{eff}/G_N$, and the DDE equation of state, $w(z)$. This MG framework\nsignificantly alleviates the tension, leading to a higher inferred value of\n$H_0 = 70.6 \\pm 1.7 \\, \\text{km s}^{-1} \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$.

This research advances space thermal modeling by\nimproving the simulation accuracy and efficiency of radiative heat transfer,\nthe dominant mode of heat exchange in space. To this end, we incorporate\ndiffuse reflectivity using the Gebhart method, which computes radiative\nexchange factors (REFs) from geometric view factors. The view factors, obtained\nvia Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT), require post-processing to mitigate\nstatistical errors. Critically, existing correction schemes cannot\nsimultaneously enforce closure and reciprocity for open systems. This research\naddresses this gap by proposing two novel enforcement methods: (i) a\nleast-squares optimization with non-negativity rectification (NNR) and small\npositive value avoidance (SPVA), and (ii) an iterative enforcement algorithm.\nTo ensure consistency across different discretization levels, this work also\nintroduces the multi-node surface model relations to formalize the connection\nbetween sub-face, face, and node representations of view factors and REFs. A\nsimple case study demonstrates a substantial reduction in mean absolute error\n(MAE): the least-squares method achieves an 81% MAE reduction, while the\niterative method offers the best balance of accuracy (56% MAE reduction) and\ncomputational efficiency. A second case study shows that including diffuse\nreflections decreases the steady-state temperature of a plate by $4^{\\circ}C$,\nreinforcing that reflected radiation reduces net absorption. This work\nintroduces and validates computationally efficient methods for integrating\ndiffuse reflectivity into space thermal analyses and for consistently coupling\nmulti-node surface radiative models.

In order to validate our FFNN model we apply it to real\ndata for the four spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star (SMDS) candidates\nrecently identified in \\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar} and\nreconfirm that indeed \\JADESeleven, \\JADESzthirteen, \\JADESfz, and \\JADESfo\nhave spectra that are consistent with those of Supermassive Dark Stars. The\nmain advantage of our FFNN model, in comparison to the Nedleaer-Mead Monte\nCarlo parameter estimator used in\n\\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}, is that the approach\nintroduced here predicts parameters in milliseconds, over 10,000 times faster\nthan the traditional method used in\n\\cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}. With this in mind, the FFNN\nmodel we developed and validated in this work will be adapted for Bayesian\nuncertainty analyses and automatic analyses of NIRSpec publicly available data\nfor high redshift objects. This study establishes a robust and efficient tool\nfor probing Dark Stars and understanding their role in cosmic evolution."}

In this study, we present a suite of\ncosmological zoom-in simulations targeting high-redshift ($z \\geq 10$) galaxies\nwith dark matter halo masses in the range $10^{10} - 10^{11}\\ {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$\nat $z=10$, using state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulation codes (Enzo,\nRamses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gadget-4, and Gizmo). This study aims to evaluate the\nconvergence of the participating codes and their reproducibility of\nhigh-redshift galaxies with the galaxy formation model calibrated at relatively\nlow redshift, without additional physics for high-redshift environments. The\nsubgrid physics follows the AGORA CosmoRun framework, with adjustments to\nresolution and initial conditions to emulate similar physical environments in\nthe early universe. The participating codes show consistent results for key\ngalaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass), but also reveal notable differences\n(e.g., metallicity), indicating that galaxy properties at high redshifts are\nhighly sensitive to the feedback implementation of the simulation. Massive\nhalos (${\\rm M}_{\\rm halo}\\geq5\\times10^{10}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$ at $z=10$)\nsucceed in reproducing observed stellar masses, metallicities, and UV\nluminosities at $10\\leq z\\leq12$ without requiring additional subgrid physics,\nbut tend to underpredict those properties at higher redshift. We also find that\nvarying the dust-to-metal ratio modestly affects UV luminosity of simulated\ngalaxies, whereas the absence of dust significantly enhances it. In future\nwork, higher-resolution simulations will be conducted to better understand the\nformation and evolution of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn."}

In particular, we show that the set of well-behaved scale-dependent\ngravity theories can be fully embedded into scalar-tensor theories in a unique\nway. Conversely, there are multiple ways to write a scalar-tensor theory as a\nscale-dependent theory. This equivalence is established both on the level of\nthe actions and on the level of field equations. We find that, in the context\nof this equivalence, the scale-setting relation $k(x)$ is naturally promoted to\na dynamical field, which is made manifest by including a corresponding kinetic\nterm in the scale-dependent action. In addition, we demonstrate that the new\nequivalence fits well into the framework of existing equivalences involving the\naforementioned theories and $f(R)$-gravity. Finally, we apply the equivalence\nrelations to explicit examples from both scale-dependent gravity and\nscalar-tensor theories."}

This backreaction effect of horizon entropy may\nresolve possible inconsistencies recently identified in black hole physics with\nmodified entropies. As specific examples, we apply this procedure to a wide\nclass of modified entropies, such as Barrow, Tsallis-Cirto, Renyi, Kaniadakis,\nlogarithmic, power-law, loop-quantum-gravity, and exponential modifications,\nand we derive the associated effective matter sectors, analyzing their physical\nproperties and energy conditions."}

Thus, we consider the relativistic Bondi accretion beyond a\nsimplified perfect-fluid setup. We focus on the complex scalar field with\ncanonical kinetic term and with a generic quartic potential which either\npreserves the U(1) symmetry or exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking. It is\nwell known that in the lowest order in gradient expansion the dynamics of such\na scalar field is well approximated by a perfect superfluid; we demonstrate\nthat going beyond this approximation systematically reduces the accretion rate\nwith respect to the perfect fluid case. Hence, black holes can provide a way to\ndistinguish a perfect fluid from its ultraviolet completion in form of the\ncomplex scalar field."}
