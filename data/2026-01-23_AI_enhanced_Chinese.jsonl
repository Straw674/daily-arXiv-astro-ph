While six-dimensional phase-space data of Galactic streams enable precise dark matter halo modelling in the Milky Way, streams around external galaxies are typically available only as low surface brightness features without kinematics (i.e. two-dimensional photometric data), providing only weak constraints when considered individually. We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework that infers the population distribution of halo flattening using only projected stream tracks. Streams are forward-modelled in StreaMAX, a new JAX-accelerated particle-spray package that achieves orders of magnitude faster stream generation when compared to traditional methods. For each stream we fit an axisymmetric dark matter halo model and obtain a posterior on the flattening. These posteriors are then combined through hierarchical reweighting to constrain the population distribution. Using mock data, we show that individual fits recover the correct flattening with modest precision and exhibit projection-induced multi-modalities. Nevertheless, aggregating these fits yields accurate and confident constraints on the underlying population distribution of dark matter halo morphologies, clearly distinguishing between oblate, spherical, and prolate populations. The total computational cost scales linearly with sample size. Our results demonstrate that ensembles of purely photometric streams carry sufficient information to constrain dark matter halo shapes in external galaxies at the population level.

A key prediction of these findings is that a reference frame constructed using highly photometrically variable AGN should be more stable than a frame that does not account for variability and that variability can be used to optimally weight all sources in order to maximize frame stability. Using ICRF3 matched to Gaia DR3, we employed a bootstrap method to estimate the multi-epoch stability of frames constructed using AGN selected at varying levels of photometric variability. We fit vector spherical harmonics to the coordinate differences between the three ICRF3 frames (S/X, K, and X/Ka) and Gaia and quantified the statistical dispersion as a function of blazar-like (high variability), quasar-like (low variability), and intermediate-variability class. An S/X reference frame constructed using blazars exceeds the stability of a frame constructed with quasars by a factor of 6 and is twice as stable as the ICRF3 defining sources. At K and X/Ka, a blazar-based frame matches or exceeds the stability of the defining sources by a factor of 1.4 in the case of X/Ka and exceeds the stability of a frame based on quasars by over a factor of 2 in both cases. The smaller improvement at K and X/Ka is likely because sources selected at higher frequency are more likely to be blazars. We derived a variability-based astrometric covariance scaling method that results in factor of 2 reduction in frame distortions and instabilities between S/X and Gaia, with a mild improvement for K but no difference for X/Ka, which is dominated by known distortions.

The reconstruction relies on an optimized discrete optimal transport algorithm that recovers the backward-in-time dynamics of tracers, naturally accounting for tracer bias without relying on cosmological assumptions. We validate BitVF against the widely used topological void finder REVOLVER using high-resolution N-body simulations, showing that it produces void catalogs with smoother and more physically motivated density profiles, as well as abundances that are more stable under tracer subsampling and shot noise. We further apply it to realistic DESI-like mock light-cone galaxy catalogs, demonstrating that it intrinsically mitigates redshift-space systematic effects, preserving real-space void size functions more faithfully than topological methods. Modeling RSD, the reconstruction can be combined with a fiducial cosmology and an assumed tracer bias within a bias-corrected Kaiser framework, yielding reconstructed-space void catalogs consistent with real-space statistics across redshift.

In this study, we present kpc-scale polarization observations of the Seyfert galaxy NGC\\,4151 using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in B-array at 3 and 10 GHz. We find that the inferred magnetic (B-) field structures show a stratification: a `spine-sheath'-like structure, with fields perpendicular to the jet direction in the `spine' and parallel in the `sheath', is observed in the higher resolution (0.5 arcsec) image at 10 GHz. In addition, a `wind'-like component with B-fields perpendicular to the radio outflow is observed in the 3 GHz image (resolution 2 arcsec); this feature is prominent along the `receding' (eastern) jet direction. Rotation measure (RM) ranges from $-230$ to 250 rad m$^{-2}$ over the polarized regions, indicating a low-electron-density ($10^{-2}-10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$) tenuous medium surrounding the source causing Faraday rotation. A {tentative} RM gradient of $+75$ to $-25$ rad m$^{-2}$ is observed transverse to the northern `wind' component, while a similar gradient with opposite sign is seen across the southern `wind' component, suggestive of a helical magnetic field threading the outflow. Based on an analysis of the available radio and X-ray data, we conclude that the stratified radio outflow in NGC 4151 is magnetically-driven. The bi-conical radio `wind' is found to be massive ($1050-3200 M_\\odot$) with a high mass outflow rate ($0.01-0.03$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) but low in kinetic power ($<0.01$% of L$_{\\rm{bol}}$), making it less impactful for galactic-scale feedback.

Traditional refraction correction techniques, originally designed for objects positioned at infinite distances, tend to overcompensate when applied to objects within the Earth's atmosphere. To rectify this issue, our study introduces the concept of the atmospheric refraction delta z correction technique, involving the artificial elevation of the observer site height above sea level. We utilize analytically derived formulas for the delta z correction in conjunction with commonly used refraction models, validating these results against a numerical solution that traces light rays through the atmosphere. This ray-tracing model is applied to finely meshed atmospheric layers, yielding precise correction values. We evaluate multiple sources of error in order to quantify the achievable accuracy of the proposed method. Our approach (1) enables the determination of fireball positions with improved astrometric accuracy, (2) removes the explicit dependence on the fireball distance from the observer or its height above Earth's surface within the limits imposed by realistic atmospheric variability, and (3) simplifies meteor data processing by providing a robust framework for analyzing low-elevation fireball observations, for which atmospheric refraction is significant and is automatically corrected by the method.

Scattered starlight from cirrus clouds in our Galaxy poses one of the major challenges to studying the low surface brightness features of extragalactic sources. Therefore, it is essential to investigate how to discriminate extragalactic sources from the cirrus cloud features. At the same time, interstellar dust clouds themselves are fundamental to understanding dust properties and the interstellar radiation field, both of which are essential for studies of chemical evolution and star formation in our Galaxy. Measuring the reddening of background sources, such as quasars, with K-DRIFT, which benefits from its broad field of view and accurate background subtraction, allows for effective detection of extended dust in galactic halos, the CGM, and intracluster space. Observations of the H-alpha emission lines can be used to identify signatures of star formation activity within galaxies, as well as the environmental effects acting on them. Galactic winds driven by active galactic nuclei and starbursts can be traced through H-alpha emission. Strong ram pressure stripping effectively removes the interstellar medium (ISM) from galaxies. The stripped ISM becomes ionized or dissociated through mixing with the hot intracluster medium (ICM), forming H-alpha tails. The surface brightness of these H-alpha tails correlates not only with the presence of star formation in the tails but also the mixing stage of the stripped ISM and ICM.

We jointly model the clustering and alignment correlations to provide the tightest constraints on the alignment amplitude to date from a hydrodynamic simulation. We find that both the Non-Linear Alignment (NLA) and the more complex Tidal Alignment Tidal Torquing (TATT) models provide good fits to the data. We compare the measured $A_1$ amplitude to observational data and find good agreement. We measure the dependence of the NLA and TATT free parameters on halo mass. We also introduce a mass-dependent TATT model, TATT-M, by finding empirical relations between the halo mass and the TATT parameters. This allows us to fit TATT with only one parameter, $A_1$, with $A_2/A_1$ being a constant and $A_{1δ}/A_1$ being a function of halo mass. Using a Bayesian approach, we find that TATT-M is very strongly preferred by the data over NLA. Using the baryonic feedback variations of the FLAMINGO simulation suite, we test whether the TATT parameters are sensitive to feedback.

We study the distribution of the emission and the deuteration of the two carbon chains HC3N and CH3CCH throughout the pre-stellar core L1544. We analyse emission maps of CH3CCH, CH2DCCH, CH3CCD, HC3N, HCC13CN, and DC3N, observed with the IRAM 30m single-dish radio telescope. We use non-LTE radiative transfer calculations, combined with chemical modelling of the molecular abundances, to constrain physical parameters of the observed species.

The deuteration of HC3N appears homogeneous across the core, with widespread D-fraction values above 0.06, tracing intermediate-density gas in the outer layers of the core. CH3CCD is most efficiently formed in the higher-density regions towards the core centre, while the D-fraction of CH2DCCH traces a local density enhancement in the north-east of the core, coinciding with the CH3OH emission peak. The results suggest that gas-phase reactions dominate the formation and deuteration of both HC3N and CH3CCH in L1544, with spatial variations driven by physical structure, density and external radiation. The significantly higher D-fraction of CH2DCCH compared to CH3CCD and a tentative gradient with higher values in the north suggest different deuteration mechanisms for the two functional groups.

Some neutrino detectors, including KamLAND and Super-Kamiokande already operate pre-SN alarm systems based on a statistically significant excess of the observed event rate over the expected background. To improve alarm sensitivity, we propose an alarm method which incorporates the time evolution of the observed pre-SN neutrino event rate. The method uses a log likelihood ratio test that references multiple theoretical stellar-evolution models and treats the core collapse time as a nuisance parameter to be profiled over. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using simulated data for the KamLAND, Super-Kamiokande with dissolved Gadolinium (SK-Gd) and their combined analysis.

In the vicinity of these systems, we discover seven background galaxies at $z=3.6 - 6$ that simultaneously exhibit strong rest-frame optical emission lines (e.g., [O III] and H$α$) and unusually reddened UV-to-optical continua. We attribute this reddening to dust extinction arising from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the foreground DSFGs at projected separations of 7-30 kpc. We infer a high dust column density ($\\gtrsim 10^{-1}$ Msun/kpc^2), substantially exceeding those measured in low-redshift halos and those predicted by hydrodynamical simulations like IllustrisTNG and FIRE-2. The steep extinction curves, comparable to or steeper than that of the SMC, indicate a dominant population of small dust grains in the high-redshift CGM. We conclude that DSFGs at this epoch host large reservoirs of dusty CGM enriched to solar metallicity.

With current challenges in measuring halo properties, the stellar-to-total dynamical mass relation is introduced as an alternative metric sensitive to the dark matter content within galaxies. We explore how spatially resolved stellar population properties vary across this relation using optical IFS data and photometry from 265 CALIFA galaxies. Spatially resolved ages and metallicities, [M/H], are derived using a Bayesian framework fed with a library of model spectra based on stochastic star formation and metallicity histories and dust attenuation. We study these properties in terms of both stellar and total dynamical mass, with the latter being enclosed mass within three effective radii from Jeans dynamical modeling. We find that ages and [M/H] measured at different annuli depend on both stellar and total mass, yet showing distinct radial trends. While the dependence of age on total mass is more prominent in the outskirts, that of [M/H] is significant in the inner parts. This behavior is reflected in the stellar population profiles and gradients, more strongly for age and connected to morphology. Intermediate-mass early-types have higher stellar-to-total mass ratios and flatter age profiles with older ages, and steep negative [M/H] profiles, whereas later-types have lower stellar-to-total mass ratios, negative age profiles with younger ages and shallower negative [M/H] profiles. Moreover, at fixed stellar mass galaxies have more negative age gradients and shallower [M/H] ones as total mass increases.

Solutions based on the Jeans equations are popular due to their robustness and computational efficiency. However, traditional semi-analytic Jeans solvers often require restrictive assumptions about the velocity anisotropy to remain computationally tractable. This paper presents a new spectral solver for the axisymmetric Jeans equations designed to overcome these limitations. I first illustrate, using orbit integrations in realistic potentials, that spherical alignment of the velocity ellipsoid is a physically well-motivated approximation for galaxy modelling. The new method employs a spectral technique to solve the Jeans partial differential equations directly. Two design choices are critical for accuracy and speed: (i) solving for the slowly-varying velocity dispersion rather than the rapidly varying pressure, and (ii) imposing a Robin boundary condition to enforce the asymptotic decay on a finite domain. This formulation supports arbitrary anisotropy distributions beta(r, theta) while simultaneously increasing computational speed by orders of magnitude compared to standard high-accuracy quadratures. Validated against exact analytic benchmarks, the solver recovers intrinsic moments with sub-percent accuracy.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "[Abbreviated] Context. Solar twins, stars whose stellar parameters (Teff, log g, and [M/H]) are very close to the Solar ones, offer a unique opportunity to investigate Galactic archaeology with very high accuracy and precision. However, most previous catalogs of Solar twins contain only a small number of objects (typically a few tens), and their selection functions are poorly characterized. Aims. We aim at building a large catalog of Solar twins from Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec, providing model-driven, rather than data-driven, stellar parameters including ages, together with a well-characterized selection function. Methods. Using stellar parameters from the Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec catalog, we selected Solar-twin candidates whose parameters lie within +- 200 K in Teff, +- 0.2 in log g, and +- 0.1 dex in [M/H] of the Solar values. Candidates unlikely to be genuine Solar twins were removed using Gaia flags and photometric constraints. We determined accurate ages for individual twins with a Bayesian isochrone-projection method, considering three combinations of parameters: Teff, [M/H], and either log g, M_G, or M_Ks. We also constructed a mock catalog to characterize the selection function. Results. Our final GSP-Spec Solar-twin catalog contains 6,594 stars. The mock catalog consisting of 75,588 artificial twins well reproduces the main characteristics of the observed catalog, especially for ages determined with M_G or M_Ks. To demonstrate the usefulness of our catalog, we compared chemical abundances [X/Fe] with age. We statistically confirmed the age--[X/Fe] relations for several species (e.g., Al, Si, Ca, and Y), demonstrating that trends previously identified in small but very high-precision samples persist in a much larger, independent sample.

In this paper we investigate a new approach to estimating ages for young populations, based on the well-founded assumption that the initial mass function is the same throughout a star forming cloud. We trial this method for six young clusters in the Perseus star forming region. For all six clusters, we construct new member samples in a homogeneous way using Gaia DR3. We estimate masses by comparing 2MASS photometry to theoretical isochrones, including Monte Carlo simulations to propagate the errors. We compare the mass distributions of the clusters for a range of plausible ages, looking for a combination of ages that results in indistinguishable mass distributions across the region. We find the best fit for ages of 1 Myr for NGC1333+Autochthe, 2 Myr for IC348, 2-3 Myr for Heleus, 3-4 Myr for Mestor, 4-5 Myr for Electryon+Cynurus, and 5-8 Myr for Alcaeus. All other combinations of ages are ruled out by this criterion. The established age sequence is consistent with the relative ages inferred from disc fractions, and broadly aligns with the age sequence determined in previous studies using isochrone fitting.

Accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal Letters (ApJL)", "summary": "3I/ATLAS is an interstellar object whose activity provides critical insights into its composition and origin. However, due to its orbital geometry, the object is too close to the Sun near perihelion to be observed from the ground, and space-based measurements are therefore required. Here we characterize the water production rate of 3I/ATLAS using SOHO/SWAN Lyman-$α$ observations from 2025 November to December (heliocentric distances 1.4 to 2.2 au) with 3D Monte Carlo modeling. We report a peak post-perihelion water production rate of $Q_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\approx 4 \\times 10^{28}$ mol s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a minimum active fraction of $\\sim$30\\% (assuming a maximum nucleus radius of 2.8 km). Comparison of our post-perihelion measurements with published pre-perihelion results reveals a heliocentric asymmetry, with an $r_h^{-5.9 \\pm 0.8}$ scaling for the inbound rise, followed by a shallower $r_h^{-3.3 \\pm 0.3}$ scaling during the outbound decline, where $r_h$ is heliocentric distance. The post-perihelion behavior indicates that the water production of 3I/ATLAS was driven primarily by the varying solar insolation acting on a stable active area. Combined with other evidence, including comparison with the hyperactive comet 103P/Hartley 2, our findings suggest that its water production is likely dominated by a distributed source of icy grains. Furthermore, it displayed remarkable stability in the activity with no signs of outbursts or rapid depletion of water production.", "AI": {"tldr": "基于SOHO/SWAN莱曼α(Lyman-α)观测数据，研究发现星际天体3I/ATLAS的峰值水生成率(Q_H2O)达4×10²⁸分子/秒，其水活动呈现日心距(r_h)不对称性（入轨r_h^(-5.9±0.8)与出轨r_h^(-3.3±0.3)），表明水活动主要由稳定活跃区域的太阳辐射驱动，且可能以冰粒分布式来源为主。", "background": "研究聚焦于星际天体3I/ATLAS的水活动特征及其动力学机制，旨在揭示其组成、起源及挥发性物质释放规律。", "data": "数据来源于SOHO/SWAN的莱曼阿尔法(Lyman-α)观测数据，覆盖2025年11月至12月期间（日心距1.4至2.2天文单位）。", "method": "采用SOHO/SWAN莱曼-α（Lyman-α）观测数据结合三维蒙特卡洛（3D Monte Carlo）建模方法分析水生成率。", "result": "3I/ATLAS的彗发活动主要由稳定的活跃区域受太阳辐射变化驱动，且其水生成可能由冰粒分布源主导。"}}
