This lack of evolution contrasts with observations at $z \\lesssim\n3$, which find an increasing normalization of the MZR with decreasing redshift.\nWe analyze a high-redshift suite of FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations to\nidentify the physical drivers of the MZR. Previous studies have explained the\nweak evolution of the high-redshift MZR in terms of weakly evolving or\nsaturated gas fractions, but we find this alone does not explain the evolution\nin FIRE-2. Instead, stellar feedback following intense bursts of star formation\ndrives enriched gas out of galaxies, resetting their interstellar medium and\nseparating their histories into distinct ``burst cycles\". We develop the\n``Reduced Burst Model\", a simplified gas-regulator model that successfully\nreproduces the simulated MZR and identifies the dominant drivers of its\nevolution. As redshift decreases, the metallicity of inflows within burst\ncycles increases at fixed stellar mass due to increased wind recycling of\nenriched gas. Meanwhile, the metal mass produced by stars per inflowing gas\nmass within these cycles decreases because of decreased star formation per gas\nmass inflowing into the galaxy.

In this regime, both WBBs and the PIR are dynamically\nimportant to the expansion of the FB. We develop a semi-analytic Co-Evolution\nModel (CEM) that takes into account the spatial distribution of forces and the\nback reactions of both the WBB and PIR.

While we find that the CEM agrees with the\nsimulations to within 25% for key parameters and modestly outperforms previous\nidealized models, disagreements remain. We show that these deviations originate\nmainly from the CEM's lack of (i) background inhomogeneity caused by turbulence\nand (ii) time-variable momentum enhancements in the wind-blown bubble (WBB).\nAdditionally, we find that photoionized gas acts similarly to magnetic fields\n([as in Lancaster et al. 2024a) by decreasing the WBB's surface area.

This paper compares the dynamical properties and\nstar-formation histories of surviving and disrupted satellites around Milky\nWay-like galaxies using the DC Justice League suite of very high-resolution\ncosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way analogs and their halo\nenvironments. We analyze the full census of galaxies accreted within the past\n12 Gyrs, which including both surviving satellites at $z=0$, and dwarf galaxies\nthat disrupted and merged with the host prior to $z=0$. Our simulations\nsuccessfully reproduce the trends in $M_*$-[Fe/H]-[$\\alpha$/Fe] observed in\nsurviving Milky Way satellites and disrupted stellar streams, indicating\nearlier star-formation for disrupted progenitors. We find the likelihood and\ntimescales for quenching and disruption are strongly correlated with the mass\nand time of infall. In particular, none of the galaxies accreted more than 12\nGyrs ago survived, and only 20% of all accreted galaxies with $M_*>10^8M_\\odot$\nsurvive. Additionally, satellites with highly radial trajectories are more\nlikely to quench and disrupt. Disruption proceeds quickly for $\\geq10^6M_\\odot$\nsatellites accreted $10{-}12$ Gyr ago, often on timescales similar to the\n$\\sim300$ Myr snapshot spacing. For high-mass satellites, the disruption\ntimescale is faster than the quenching timescale. As a result, 92% of disrupted\ngalaxies remain star-forming up until disruption. In contrast, Ultra Faint\nDwarfs (UFDs) tend to quench prior to accretion, and 94% of UFDs accreted up to\n12 Gyr ago survive at $z=0$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7814\u7a76\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u7c7b\u4f3c\u661f\u7cfb\u5468\u56f4\u536b\u661f\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u548c\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u536b\u661f\u661f\u7cfb\u5b58\u6d3b\u4e0e\u74e6\u89e3\u7684\u89c4\u5f8b\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8fdb\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "background": "\u7406\u89e3\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u5438\u79ef\u5386\u53f2\u5bf9\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u536b\u661f\u661f\u7cfb\u548c\u6052\u661f\u6655\u7684\u7279\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5206\u6790\u536b\u661f\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u548c\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "data": "\u4f7f\u7528DC Justice League\u5957\u4ef6\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8fc7\u53bb120\u4ebf\u5e74\u5185\u5438\u79ef\u7684\u661f\u7cfb\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b58\u6d3b\u548c\u74e6\u89e3\u7684\u536b\u661f\u661f\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5b87\u5b99\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u536b\u661f\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8fdb\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u3001\u8f68\u9053\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u5176\u5b58\u6d3b\u548c\u74e6\u89e3\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u6210\u529f\u91cd\u73b0\u4e86\u5b58\u6d3b\u536b\u661f\u661f\u7cfb\u548c\u74e6\u89e3\u6052\u661f\u6d41\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u74e6\u89e3\u661f\u7cfb\u7684\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u66f4\u65e9\uff1b\u5b58\u6d3b\u548c\u74e6\u89e3\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8fdb\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u9ad8\u5f84\u5411\u8f68\u9053\u7684\u536b\u661f\u66f4\u6613\u74e6\u89e3\uff1b\u8d85\u6697\u77ee\u661f\u7cfb\uff08UFDs\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u5438\u79ef\u524d\u505c\u6b62\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u6d3b\u7387\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002"}}

For the CCS 77-66 transition, we\ndetected emission in 10 out of 82 targeted sources, all of which also exhibited\nemission in the CCS JN = 87-76 line. Physical parameters are derived for our\ndetections, including the optical depth and excitation temperature of N2H+, the\nrotational temperature of CCS and the column density. Combining our results and\nprevious observation results in different stages of high-mass star-forming\nregions (HMSFRs), we found that the column density ratio N(N2H+)/N(CCS)\nincreases from high-mass starless cores (HMSCs) through high-mass protostellar\ncores (HMPOs) to UC HIIs. This implies that N(N2H+)/N(CCS) can trace the\nevolution process of HMSFRs. It was supported by our gas-grain chemical model,\nwhich shows that N(N2H+)/N(CCS) increases with the evolution age of HMSFRs. The\ntemperature, density and chemical age were also constrained from our best-fit\nmodel at each stage.

Using the Early Release Observations (ERO) of the Perseus\ncluster, we demonstrate the capability offered by Euclid in studying the nature\nof perturbations for galaxies in clusters. Filamentary structures are observed\nalong the discs of two spiral galaxies with no extended diffuse emission\nexpected from tidal interactions at surface brightness levels of $\\sim$\n$30\\,{\\rm mag}\\,{\\rm arcsec}^{-2}$. The detected features exhibit a good\ncorrespondence in morphology between optical and near-infrared wavelengths,\nwith a surface brightness of $\\sim$ $25\\,{\\rm mag}\\,{\\rm arcsec}^{-2}$, and the\nknots within the features have sizes of $\\sim$ 100 pc, as observed through\n$I_E$ imaging. Using the Euclid, CFHT, UVIT, and LOFAR $144\\,{\\rm MHz}$ radio\ncontinuum observations, we conduct a detailed analysis to understand the origin\nof the detected features. We constructed the \\textit{Euclid} $I_E-Y_E$,\n$Y_E-H_E$, and CFHT $u - r$, $g - i$ colour-colour plane and showed that these\nfeatures contain recent star formation events, which are also indicated by\ntheir H$\\alpha$ and NUV emissions. Euclid colours alone are insufficient for\nstudying stellar population ages in unresolved star-forming regions, which\nrequire multi-wavelength optical imaging data. The morphological shape,\norientation, and mean age of the stellar population, combined with the presence\nof extended radio continuum cometary tails can be consistently explained if\nthese features have been formed during a recent ram-pressure stripping event.\nThis result further confirms the exceptional qualities of Euclid in the study\nof galaxy evolution in dense environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Euclid\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u661f\u7cfb\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u4e2d\u661f\u7cfb\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "background": "Euclid\u671b\u8fdc\u955c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8986\u76d614,000\u5e73\u65b9\u5ea6\u7684\u5149\u5b66\u548c\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u6210\u50cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5176\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u8868\u9762\u4eae\u5ea6\u6c34\u5e73\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u661f\u7cfb\u5728\u661f\u7cfb\u7fa4\u548c\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "data": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86Euclid\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u5e03\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff08ERO\uff09\u5bf9\u82f1\u4ed9\u5ea7\u661f\u7cfb\u56e2\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408CFHT\u3001UVIT\u548cLOFAR\u7684144 MHz\u5c04\u7535\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7Euclid\u7684IE-YE\u3001YE-HE\u548cCFHT\u7684u-r\u3001g-i\u989c\u8272\u5e73\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408H\u03b1\u548cNUV\u53d1\u5c04\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u661f\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u7531\u8fd1\u671f\u53d1\u751f\u7684\u51b2\u538b\u5265\u79bb\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5f62\u6210\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ed3\u8bba\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u6052\u661f\u79cd\u7fa4\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u5c04\u7535\u8fde\u7eed\u8c31\u5f57\u5c3e\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86Euclid\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5bc6\u96c6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u661f\u7cfb\u6f14\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5353\u8d8a\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

These anomalies\nappear near the peaks of the light curves, where the magnifications are\nmoderately high, and are distinguished by weak caustic-crossing features with\nminimal distortion while the source remains inside the caustic. To achieve a\ndeeper understanding of these anomalies, we conducted a comprehensive analysis\nof the lensing events. We carried out binary-lens modeling with a thorough\nexploration of the parameter space. This analysis revealed that the anomalies\nin both events are of planetary origin, although their exact interpretation is\ncomplicated by different types of degeneracy. In the case of MOA-2022-BLG-091,\nthe main difficulty in the interpretation of the anomaly arises from a newly\nidentified degeneracy related to the uncertain angle at which the source\ntrajectory intersects the planet-host axis. For KMT-2024-BLG-1209, the\ninterpretation is affected by the previously known inner-outer degeneracy,\nwhich leads to ambiguity between solutions in which the source passes through\neither the inner or outer caustic region relative to the planet host. Bayesian\nanalysis indicates that the planets in both lens systems are giant planets with\nmasses about 2 to 4 times that of Jupiter, orbiting early K-type main-sequence\nstars. Both systems are likely located in the Galactic disk at a distance of\naround 4 kiloparsecs. The degeneracy in KMT-2024-BLG-1209 is challenging to\nresolve because it stems from intrinsic similarities in the caustic structures\nof the degenerate solutions.
