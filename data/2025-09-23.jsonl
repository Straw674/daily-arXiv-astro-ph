The discovery of Kamino is reported here for the first time. They\nrank among the most isolated faint dwarf galaxies known, hence they provide\nunique opportunities to study galaxy evolution at the smallest scales, free\nfrom environmental effects of more massive galaxies. Our HST data reach\n$\\sim$2-4 magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch for each dwarf,\nallowing us to measure their distances, structural properties, and recent star\nformation histories (SFHs). All three galaxies contain a complex stellar\npopulation of young and old stars, and are typical of field galaxies in this\nmass regime ($M_V=-10.62\\pm0.08$ and $D=2.16^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ Mpc for Pavo,\n$M_V=-10.91\\pm0.10$ and $D=3.34\\pm0.11$ Mpc for Corvus A, and\n$M_V=-12.02\\pm0.12$ and $D=6.50^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ Mpc for Kamino). Our\nHST-derived SFHs reveal differences among the three dwarfs: Pavo and Kamino\nshow relatively steady, continuous star formation, while Corvus A formed\n$\\sim$$60$% of its stellar mass by 10 Gyr ago.

However, accurate measurements of the EoR signal\nfrom radio interferometric observations are sensitive to efficient foreground\nremoval, mitigating radio-frequency interference and accounting for\ninstrumental systematics. This work represents the first in a series of papers,\nwhere we will be introducing a novel ML based pipeline, step-by-step, to\ndirectly infer reionization parameters from 21-cm radio-interferometric images.\nIn this paper, we investigate the impact of the variations in the point spread\nfunction (PSF) on parameter estimation by simulating visibilities corresponding\nto input 21-cm maps as observed by the 128-antenna configuration of the\nMurchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II. These visibilities are imaged to\nobtain dirty images, which are then used to train a 2D convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) to predict $\\rm x_{HI}$. To systematically assess the effect of\nPSF mis-modelling, we generate multiple test sets by varying the MWA's antenna\nlayout, thereby introducing controlled variations in the PSF; we then feed\nthese alternative PSF dirty images to our CNN trained using only dirty images\nwith the PSF of the true antenna layout. Our results demonstrate that PSF\nvariations introduce biases in the CNN's predictions of $\\rm x_{HI}$, with\nerrors depending on the extent of PSF distortion. We quantify these biases and\ndiscuss their implications for the reliability of machine-learning-based\nparameter inference in 21-cm cosmology and how they can be utilized to improve\nthe robustness of estimation against PSF-related systematics in future 21-cm\nsurveys.

We focus on two techniques: (i) statistical\ndown-weighting of low-frequency atmospheric signals, and (ii) pair-differencing\n(PD), which involves differencing signals collected by two detectors in the\nsame focal plane pixel. We compare their performance against the idealized case\nwhere the atmospheric signal is perfectly known and cleanly subtracted.

In the\nabsence of instrumental systematics but with reasonable detector noise\nvariations, PD yields polarized sky maps with noise levels only slightly worse\nthan the ideal case. While down-weighting could match this performance, it\nrequires highly accurate atmospheric models that are not readily available. PD\nperformance is affected by instrumental systematics, particularly those leaking\natmospheric signal to the difference time stream.

This project describes a\ndiagnostic tool for identifying main-sequence (MS) star-forming galaxies (SFGs)\nin the local Universe using IR dust emission features that are characteristic\nof galaxy activity. A physically-motivated sample of mock galaxy spectra has\nbeen generated to simulate the IR emission of SFGs. Using this sample, we\ndeveloped a diagnostic tool for identifying MS SFGs based on machine learning\nmethods. Custom photometric bands were defined to target dust emission\nfeatures, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the dust\ncontinuum. Three bands were chosen to trace PAH features at 6.2 {\\mu}m, 7.7\n{\\mu}m, 8.6 {\\mu}m, and 11.3 {\\mu}m, along with an additional band to probe the\nradiation field strength responsible for heating the dust. This diagnostic was\nsubsequently applied to observed galaxies to evaluate its effectiveness in\nreal-world applications. Our diagnostic achieves high performance, with an\naccuracy of 90.9% on MS SFGs (observed sample of SFGs). Additionally, it shows\nlow contamination, with only 16.2% of AGN galaxies being misidentified as SF.\nCombining observational data with stellar population synthesis models enables\nthe creation of physically-motivated samples of SFGs that match the spectral\nproperties of real galaxies. By positioning custom photometric bands targeting\nkey dust features, our diagnostic can extract valuable information without the\nneed to measure emission lines. Although PAHs are sensitive indicators of star\nformation and interstellar medium radiation hardness, PAH emission alone is\ninsufficient for identifying MS SFGs. Finally, we developed a\nphysically-motivated spectral library of MS SFGs spanning from UV to FIR\nwavelengths."}

Recent empirical studies have reported a\ndependence of the IRRC on the galaxy stellar mass, in which more massive\ngalaxies tend to show lower infrared-to-radio ratios (qIR) with respect to less\nmassive galaxies. One possible, yet unexplored, explanation is a residual\ncontamination of the radio emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN), not\ncaptured through \"radio-excess\" diagnostics. To investigate this hypothesis, we\naim to statistically quantify the contribution of AGN emission to the radio\nluminosities of SFGs located within the scatter of the IRRC. Our VLBA program\n\"AGN-sCAN\" has targeted 500 galaxies that follow the qIR distribution of the\nIRRC, i.e., with no prior evidence for radio-excess AGN emission based on\nlow-resolution (~ arcsec) VLA radio imaging. Our VLBA 1.4 GHz observations\nreach a 5-sigma sensitivity limit of 25 microJy/beam, corresponding to a radio\nbrightness temperature of Tb ~ 10^5 K.

While previous studies found that galaxies closer to\nfilaments tend to be more massive and quenched, it remained unclear whether\nthese trends reflect intrinsic environmental effects or changes in the galaxy\npopulation mix. To address this, we focus exclusively on star-forming galaxies,\nrobustly selected using both the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and gas\ndepletion timescale criteria, in order to isolate the direct impact of the\ncosmic web on star-forming galaxies. We reconstruct the 3D cosmic web skeleton\nusing DisPerSE and compute each galaxy's distance to its nearest filament.\nAfter removing mass dependencies, we examine deviations in star formation rate\n(SFR), sSFR, molecular and atomic gas depletion timescales, and gas fractions\nas a function of this distance. We find a clear and redshift-dependent\nmodulation of star formation with filament proximity: at high redshift ($z\n\\gtrsim 2$), galaxies closer to filaments show enhanced SFR and gas accretion,\nreflecting efficient filament-fed growth. At $z=0$, we observe a V-shaped trend\nin the sSFR and depletion timescales, with minima at intermediate distances\n($\\sim 0.25$ cMpc) and a surprising upturn very close to the filament cores,\nsuggesting a resumed accretion in the densest environments. These effects are\nnot driven by mergers and are primarily associated with satellite galaxies at\nlow redshift. Our results demonstrate that large-scale cosmic web proximity\nmodulates star formation in star-forming galaxies through a combination of gas\nsupply regulation and environmental processing, with different mechanisms\ndominating across cosmic time."}

However, accurate measurements of the EoR signal\nfrom radio interferometric observations are sensitive to efficient foreground\nremoval, mitigating radio-frequency interference and accounting for\ninstrumental systematics. This work represents the first in a series of papers,\nwhere we will be introducing a novel ML based pipeline, step-by-step, to\ndirectly infer reionization parameters from 21-cm radio-interferometric images.\nIn this paper, we investigate the impact of the variations in the point spread\nfunction (PSF) on parameter estimation by simulating visibilities corresponding\nto input 21-cm maps as observed by the 128-antenna configuration of the\nMurchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II. These visibilities are imaged to\nobtain dirty images, which are then used to train a 2D convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) to predict $\\rm x_{HI}$. To systematically assess the effect of\nPSF mis-modelling, we generate multiple test sets by varying the MWA's antenna\nlayout, thereby introducing controlled variations in the PSF; we then feed\nthese alternative PSF dirty images to our CNN trained using only dirty images\nwith the PSF of the true antenna layout. Our results demonstrate that PSF\nvariations introduce biases in the CNN's predictions of $\\rm x_{HI}$, with\nerrors depending on the extent of PSF distortion. We quantify these biases and\ndiscuss their implications for the reliability of machine-learning-based\nparameter inference in 21-cm cosmology and how they can be utilized to improve\nthe robustness of estimation against PSF-related systematics in future 21-cm\nsurveys. In concluding, we also discuss how this approach to incorporating\nrealistic instrument error into an ML analysis pipeline can be expanded to\ninclude multiple other effects."}

Our modelling suggests that a\ncombination of ram pressure and tidal forces are responsible for the nature of\nthe system. Although the pair lies well outside of the virial radius of the\nVirgo cluster, ram pressure due to infall through an extensive envelope of hot\ngas around the cluster is most likely responsible for the HI tail.

We compare their performance against the idealized case\nwhere the atmospheric signal is perfectly known and cleanly subtracted.

In the\nabsence of instrumental systematics but with reasonable detector noise\nvariations, PD yields polarized sky maps with noise levels only slightly worse\nthan the ideal case.

The\nX-ray emitting region is far too small to be directly imaged, but rapid\nvariability of the X-ray signal can be used to infer the geometry by measuring\ntime lags caused by material propagating towards the black hole and by coronal\nX-rays reflecting off the disk to imprint a reverberation lag. Reverberation\nlags can be recognized by characteristic spectral features, including an iron\nemission line at $\\sim 6.4$ keV and a broad Compton hump peaking at $\\sim 30$\nkeV. These reverberation features have both previously been detected for a few\nsupermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs).

Previous reverberation lag\nmeasurements for stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems have thus\nbeen limited to energies below 10 keV.

The accompanying\ndetection of an iron line feature confirms the scenario of X-ray reverberation\nand provides strong evidence that the accretion flows in AGNs and X-ray\nbinaries are governed by an ubiquitous process.

With modern\nobservations and continuous data streams, the study of BMRs has moved from\nmanual sunspot catalogs to automated detection and tracking methods. In this\nwork, we present an additional module to the existing BMR tracking algorithm,\nAutoTAB, that focuses on identifying emerging signatures of BMRs. Specifically,\nfor regions newly detected on the solar disk, this module backtracks the BMRs\nto their point of emergence. From a total of about 12000 BMRs identified by\nAutoTAB, we successfully backtracked 3080 cases. Within this backtracked\nsample, we find two distinct populations. One group shows the expected\nbehaviour of emerging regions, in which the magnetic flux increases\nsignificantly during the emerging phase. The other group consists of BMRs whose\nflux, however, does not exhibit substantial growth during their evolution. We\nclassify these as non-emerging BMRs and examine their statistical properties\nseparately. Our analysis shows that these non-emerging BMRs do not display any\npreferred tilt angle distribution nor show systematic latitudinal tilt\ndependence, in contrast to the trends typically associated with emerging BMRs.\nThis indicates that including such regions in statistical studies of BMR\nproperties can distort or mask the underlying physical characteristics. We\ntherefore emphasise the importance of excluding the non-emerging population\nfrom the whole dataset when analysing the statistical behaviour of BMRs."}

Reverberation\nlags can be recognized by characteristic spectral features, including an iron\nemission line at $\\sim 6.4$ keV and a broad Compton hump peaking at $\\sim 30$\nkeV. These reverberation features have both previously been detected for a few\nsupermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs).

Previous reverberation lag\nmeasurements for stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binary systems have thus\nbeen limited to energies below 10 keV.

Comments welcome", "summary": "We investigate how the star formation activity of galaxies depends on their\nposition within the cosmic web using the SIMBA cosmological simulation from\nredshift $z=3$ to $z=0$. While previous studies found that galaxies closer to\nfilaments tend to be more massive and quenched, it remained unclear whether\nthese trends reflect intrinsic environmental effects or changes in the galaxy\npopulation mix. To address this, we focus exclusively on star-forming galaxies,\nrobustly selected using both the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and gas\ndepletion timescale criteria, in order to isolate the direct impact of the\ncosmic web on star-forming galaxies. We reconstruct the 3D cosmic web skeleton\nusing DisPerSE and compute each galaxy's distance to its nearest filament.\nAfter removing mass dependencies, we examine deviations in star formation rate\n(SFR), sSFR, molecular and atomic gas depletion timescales, and gas fractions\nas a function of this distance. We find a clear and redshift-dependent\nmodulation of star formation with filament proximity: at high redshift ($z\n\\gtrsim 2$), galaxies closer to filaments show enhanced SFR and gas accretion,\nreflecting efficient filament-fed growth. At $z=0$, we observe a V-shaped trend\nin the sSFR and depletion timescales, with minima at intermediate distances\n($\\sim 0.25$ cMpc) and a surprising upturn very close to the filament cores,\nsuggesting a resumed accretion in the densest environments. These effects are\nnot driven by mergers and are primarily associated with satellite galaxies at\nlow redshift. Our results demonstrate that large-scale cosmic web proximity\nmodulates star formation in star-forming galaxies through a combination of gas\nsupply regulation and environmental processing, with different mechanisms\ndominating across cosmic time."}

These observations are part\nof an ongoing effort to build a large, spectroscopically confirmed sample of\nstrong lensing systems for studies on dark matter, galaxy structure, and\ncosmology. Our MUSE program targets both lens and source redshifts, with\nparticular emphasis on southern hemisphere systems. MUSE's wide spectral\ncoverage and integral field capability allow for efficient identification of\nmultiple sources, lens environments, and weak spectral features. Redshifts for\nlenses and sources were obtained via manual identification of spectral features\nin extracted 1D spectra. Our dataset includes systems with complex\nconfigurations, such as multiple source planes and group or cluster-scale\nenvironments. We extracted and analyzed 185 spectra, successfully determining\nboth the lens and the source redshifts for 48 gravitational lens systems. For\nan additional 21 targets, we measured the redshifts of the lenses but were\nunable to determine the redshifts of the background sources. Six targets were\nconfirmed to not be gravitational lenses. The results presented here complement\nspace-based imaging from our HST SNAPshot program and spectroscopic follow-up\nwith DESI and Keck, and have lasting legacy value for identifying interesting\nhigh-redshift sources and complex lensing configurations."}

These strong lenses\nwere found in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys using Residual Neural Networks\n(ResNet) and followed up by our Hubble Space Telescope program, with all\nsystems displaying unambiguous lensed arcs. With NIRES, we target eight lensed\nsources at redshifts difficult to measure in the optical range and determine\nthe source redshifts for six, between $z_s$ = 1.675 and 3.332. DESI observed\none of the remaining source redshifts, as well as an additional source redshift\nwithin the six systems. The two systems with non-detections by NIRES were\nobserved for a considerably shorter 600s at high airmass. Combining NIRES\ninfrared spectroscopy with optical spectroscopy from our DESI Strong Lensing\nSecondary Target Program, these results provide the complete lens and source\nredshifts for six systems, a resource for refining automated strong lens\nsearches in future deep- and wide-field imaging surveys and addressing a range\nof questions in astrophysics and cosmology."}
