Unveiling small-scale magneto-ionic structures with Faraday complexity", "categories": ["astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "32 pages, 19 figures, MNRAS accepted", "summary": "Radio broadband spectro-polarimetric observations are sensitive to the\nspatial fluctuations of the Faraday depth (FD) within the telescope beam. Such\nFD fluctuations are referred to as \"Faraday complexity\", and can unveil\nsmall-scale magneto-ionic structures in both the synchrotron-emitting and the\nforeground volumes. We explore the astrophysical origin of the Faraday\ncomplexity exhibited by 191 polarised extragalactic radio sources (EGSs) within\n5 deg from the Galactic plane in the longitude range of 20-52 deg, using\nbroadband data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array presented by a previous\nwork. A new parameter called the FD spread is devised to quantify the spatial\nFD fluctuations. We find that the FD spread of the EGSs (i) demonstrates an\nenhancement near the Galactic mid-plane, most notable within Galactic latitude\nof +-3 deg, (ii) exhibits hints of modulations across Galactic longitude, (iii)\ndoes not vary with the source size across the entire range of 2.5\"-300\", and\n(iv) has an amplitude higher than expected from magneto-ionic structures of\nextragalactic origin. All these suggest that the primary cause of the Faraday\ncomplexity exhibited by our target EGSs is <2.5\"-scale magneto-ionic structures\nin the Milky Way. We argue that the anisotropic turbulent magnetic field\ngenerated by galactic-scale shocks and shears, or the stellar feedback-driven\nisotropic turbulent magnetic field, are the most likely candidates. Our work\nhighlights the use of broadband radio polarimetric observations of EGSs as a\npowerful probe of multi-scale magnetic structures in the Milky Way."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "The presence of magnetic fields in galaxies and their haloes could have\nimportant consequences for satellite galaxies moving through the magnetised\ncircumgalactic medium (CGM) of their host. We therefore study the effect of\nmagnetic fields on ram pressure stripping of satellites in the CGM of massive\ngalaxies. We use cosmological `zoom-in' simulations of three massive galaxy\nhaloes ($M_{\\rm{200c}} = 10^{12.5-13}$M$_\\odot$), each simulated with and\nwithout magnetic fields. The fraction of gas retained after infall through the\nCGM across our full satellite sample shows no population-wide impact of\nmagnetic fields on ram pressure stripping. However, for the most massive\nsatellites, we find that twice as much gas is stripped without magnetic fields.\nThe evolution of a galaxy's stripped tail is also strongly affected. Magnetic\nfields reduce turbulent mixing, significantly inhibiting the dispersion of\nmetals into the host CGM. This suppressed mixing greatly reduces condensation\nfrom the host CGM onto the stripped tail. By studying the magnetic field\nstructure, we find evidence of magnetic draping and attribute differences in\nthe stripping rate to the draping layer. Differences in condensation from the\nhost CGM are attributed to magnetic field lines aligned with the tail\nsuppressing turbulent mixing. We simulate one halo with enhanced resolution in\nthe CGM and show these results are converged with resolution, though the\nstructure of the cool gas in the tail is not. Our results show that magnetic\nfields can play an important role in ram pressure stripping in galaxy haloes\nand should be included in simulations of galaxy formation."}

The analysis of\norbital parameter space is used to distinguish bulge stars that, in the bar\nreference frame, have prograde orbits from those in retrograde orbits. We\nclassify the prograde stars into orbital families and estimate the chaoticity\n(in the form of frequency drift) of their orbits. RR~Lyrae stars with\nbanana-like orbits have a bimodal distance distribution, similar to the\ndistance distribution seen in the metal-rich red clump stars. The fraction of\nstars with banana-like orbits decreases linearly with metallicity, as does the\nfraction of stars on prograde orbits (in the bar reference frame). The\nretrograde moving stars (in the bar reference frame) form a centrally\nconcentrated nearly spherical distribution.

While\nrecent fast ejections by Sgr A* have been identified in the form of\nhypervelocity stars (hundreds to thousands km/s), it is also expected that the\nstellar halo contains slower stars, ejected over the last few billion years. In\nthis study, we use the first data release of DESI to search for these slower GC\nejecta, which are expected to stand out from the stellar halo population for\ntheir combined high metallicity (${\\rm [Fe/H]}\\gtrsim0$) and small values of\ntheir vertical angular momentum ($L_Z$), whose distribution should peak at\nzero. Our search does not yield a detection, but allows us to place an upper\nlimit on the ejection rate of stars from the GC of $\\sim2.8\\times10^{-3}$\nyr$^{-1}$ over the past ~5 Gyr, which is ejection model independent.

We investigate the impact of ambipolar diffusion on the development of\nthe Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) with an oblique magnetic field in the\nincompressible limit. Methods. We developed a general bi-fluid framework\ncomprising charges and neutrals with the specific feature of differing gravity\nbetween charges and neutrals. We derived the perturbed magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) equations and obtained an analytic dispersion relation for an oblique\nmagnetic field. The growth rate was then evaluated using a numerical\nintegration of the dispersion relation. In particular, we focussed on the\nanisotropy in the mode growth induced ambipolar diffusion. Results. In contrast\nto the case of a magnetic field within the interface, an oblique magnetic field\nis much less restrictive with respect to the wavenumbers that can develop;\nrather than a sharp cut-off, it results in a selection of preferred scales for\nmode growth. The presence of a second neutral fluid that is insensitive to\ngravity tends to amplify the anisotropy in the possible direction of the\ninstability development.

One intriguing proposal is that black holes (BHs) could be\nthe astrophysical source of dark energy through a cosmological coupling\nmechanism, and strong evidence has been claimed via analyzing the growth of the\nblack hole masses in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies at redshifts $\\leq\n2.5$. In this work, with a group of very high redshift AGNs detected by the\nJames Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies, we\nshow that the possibility of BHs being the astrophysical source of dark energy\nhas been rejected at a confidence level exceeding 10$\\sigma$. Moreover, it\nturns out that the Little Red Dots recently discovered by JWST, characterized\nby the low accretion rates, can naturally evolve into the red-sequence\nelliptical galaxies hosting the relatively low mass black holes at the\nredshifts of $\\sim 0.7-2.5$, without the need of black hole cosmological\ncoupling."}

It has been shown to result in significant mass loss and disc truncation,\nultimately reducing the lifetime of the discs, and possibly affecting potential\nplanet populations. It is a well-studied process in the Orion Nebula Cluster\n(ONC) where the cometary morphology of proplyds is spatially resolvable due to\nits proximity to Earth. However, we need to study external photoevaporation in\nadditional stellar clusters to better understand its prevalence and\nsignificance more globally. Unfortunately, more massive stellar clusters where\nthe majority of stars form are much farther away than the ONC. In these more\ndistant clusters the proplyds are spatially unresolvable with current\nfacilities, hence the cometary morphology is not a useful identification of\nexternal photoevaporation. Therefore, in order to identify and interpret\nexternal photoevaporation, the only observations we have are of spatially\nunresolved emission lines. To resolve this issue we have used the CLOUDY code\nto develop an approximate general model of the emission lines emanating from\nthe hot ionized wind of a proplyd. We have used the model to determine which\nline ratios are most sensitive to the distance from an OB star, and found that\nthe most sensitive line ratios vary by multiple orders of magnitude over an FUV\nfield of between 10$^3$ G$_0$ to 10$^6$ G$_0$. By identifying spatial gradients\nof line ratios in stellar clusters, we can identify regions of ongoing external\nphotoevaporation."}
