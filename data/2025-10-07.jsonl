We\nperform a N$_2$H$^+$ hyperfine spectral line fitting to analyze multiple\nvelocity components and spectral parameters. We estimate velocity gradients,\ncolumn densities, and line-mass profiles for the two main filaments in G012,\nnamed R1 and R2. Line-mass profiles follow $\\lambda$($\\omega$) = 5660\nM$_{\\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$($\\omega$/pc)$^{0.30}$ (R1) and $\\lambda$($\\omega$) = 6943\nM$_{\\odot}$ pc$^{-1}$($\\omega$/pc)$^{0.20}$ (R2), which are much larger than\nthose of typical low-mass filaments. R1 and R2 show disparate position-velocity\n(PV) features. R1 exhibits a transverse velocity gradient of 10.4 kms$^{-1}\n$pc$^{-1}$ and few dense cores. This gradient is interpreted with a simple\nrotation toy model, combined with line-mass profile, and corresponds to a\nrotational timescale of 0.1 Myr. In contrast, R2 exhibits compact velocity\nstructures ($\\Delta$V < 2 kms$^{-1}$), likely due to collapse, as evidenced by\nthe presence of a comparatively large number of massive cores and protostellar\noutflows. R2 is forming prestellar and protostellar cores at a rate of 55.3\nM$_{\\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$, with an efficiency similar to the Orion Integral Shaped\nFilament (ISF). The R1 filament, in contrast, lacks protostellar cores and only\ncontains a few prestellar cores, resulting in an estimated SFR of 4.2\nM$_{\\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$, more than an order of magnitude below that of R2.\nCombining these lines of evidence, we suggest that R1 is younger and still\nrotating, while R2 has evolved to collapse with a higher SFR.

We\nbuild a convolutional denoising autoencoder (DAE) for galaxy model subtraction:\nimages are compressed to a latent representation and reconstructed to yield the\nsmooth galaxy, suppressing other objects. The DAE is trained on\nGALFIT-generated model galaxies injected into real sky backgrounds and tested\non real images from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS).

We use the Illustris and\nIllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to provide a theoretical\nprediction for the fraction of galaxy systems that are involved in a multiple\nmerger as a function of various parameters, with a focus on the relationship\nbetween the multiple merger fraction $f_m$ and the total merger fraction $f_t$.\nWe generally find that binary mergers dominate the total fraction and that\n$f_m\\approx (0.5-0.7)f_t^{5/3}$, a prediction that can be tested\nobservationally.

Both disk and halo\npopulations also display small but significant mean expansion of 3-9 km/s\n(p<0.01). These results are consistent with our previous studies, where\nglobular clusters showed outward velocities of 17-31 km/s up to 12 kpc, and\naxisymmetric analyses of Gaia DR3 stars indicated expansion of ~19 km/s to 5\nkpc.

A challenging question in such\nmodels is how to keep the shear under control in the contracting phase, as it\nis well-known that the shear grows as fast as $1/a^{6}$ toward the bounce,\nwhere $a$ is the expansion factor of the universe. A common approach is to\nintroduce a scalar field with an ekpyrotic-like potential which becomes\nnegative near the bounce, so the effective equation of state of the scalar\nfield will be greater than one, whereby it dominates the shear and other matter\nfields in the bounce region. As a result, a homogeneous and isotropic universe\ncan be produced. In this paper, we study how the ekpyrotic mechanism affects\nthe inflationary phase in both loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and a modified loop\nquantum cosmological model (mLQC-I), because in these frameworks the inflation\nis generic without such a mechanism. After numerically studying various cases\nin which the potential of the inflaton consists of two parts, an inflationary\npotential and an ekpyrotic-like one, we find that, despite the fact that the\ninfluence is significant, by properly choosing the free parameters involved in\nthe models, the ekpyrotic-like potential dominates in the bounce region, during\nwhich the effective equation of state is larger than one, so the shear problem\nis resolved. As the time continuously increases after the bounce, the\ninflationary potential grows and ultimately becomes dominant, resulting in an\ninflationary phase.

We analyze\nAME in 144 Galactic clouds by combining low-frequency maps from S-PASS (2.3\nGHz), C-BASS (4.76 GHz), and QUIJOTE (10-20 GHz) with 21 ancillary maps. Using\naperture photometry and parametric SED fitting via MCMC methods without\ninformative priors, we measure AME emissivity, peak frequency, and spectral\nwidth. We achieve peak frequency constraints nearly three times tighter than\nprevious work and identify 83 new AME sources. AME spectra are generally\nbroader than predicted by spinning dust models for a single phase of the\ninterstellar medium, suggesting either multiple spinning dust components along\nthe line of sight or incomplete representation of the grain size distribution\nin current models. However, the narrowest observed widths match theoretical\npredictions, supporting the spinning dust hypothesis. The AME amplitude\ncorrelates most strongly with the thermal dust peak flux and radiance, showing\n$\\sim30$% scatter and sublinear scaling, which suggests reduced AME efficiency\nin regions with brighter thermal dust emission. AME peak frequency increases\nwith thermal dust temperature in a trend current theoretical models do not\nreproduce, indicating that spinning dust models must incorporate dust evolution\nand radiative transfer in a self-consistent framework where environmental\nparameters and grain properties are interdependent. PAH tracers correlate with\nAME emissivity, supporting a physical link to small dust grains. Finally, a\nlog-Gaussian function provides a good empirical description of the AME spectrum\nacross the sample, given current data quality and frequency coverage."}

Each filament and its\ncorresponding clump are analysed by calculating flow rates along each filament\ntowards the clump, onto each filament from increasing distances, and radially\naround each clump. This analysis is conducted for two cubes, one feedback\ndominated region, and one with less feedback. Looking at the face-on\ninclination of the simulations (0 degrees), we observe different trends\ndepending on the environmental conditions (more or less feedback). The median\nflow rate in the region with more feedback is 8.9$\\times$10$^{-5}$\nM$_{sun}\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and we see that flow rates along the filaments toward\nthe clumps generally decrease in these regions. In the region with less\nfeedback we have a median flow rate of 2.9$\\times$10$^{-4}$\nM$_{sun}\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and when looking along the filaments here we see the\nvalues either increase or remain constant. We find that the flow rates from the\nenvironments onto the primary filaments are of an order of magnitude sufficient\nto sustain the flow rates along these filaments. When discussing the effects of\ngalactic and filamentary inclination, we also observe that viewing the\nfilaments from different galactic inclinations can reveal the presence of\nfeeder structures (smaller filamentary structures aiding in the flow of\nmaterial).

Edge-on disks offer a unique opportunity to directly examine their\nvertical structure, providing valuable insights into planet formation\nprocesses. We investigate the dust properties, as well as the CO and HCO$^+$\ngas properties, in the edge-on disk surrounding the T Tauri star 2MASS\nJ04202144+281349 (SSTTau042021). Aims. We estimate the radial and vertical\ntemperature and density profile for the gas and the dust. Methods. We use ALMA\narchival data of CO isotopologues and continuum emission at 2, 1.3 and 0.9 mm\ntogether with new NOEMA HCO$^+$ 3-2 observations. We retrieve the gas and dust\ndisk properties using the tomographic method and the \\textsc{DiskFit} model.\nResults. The vertical CO emission appears very extended, partly tracing the\nH$_2$ wind observed by JWST. C$^{18}$O, $^{13}$CO and HCO$^+$ emission\ncharacterize the bulk of the molecular layer. The dust and gas have a mid-plane\ntemperatures of $\\sim 7-11$ K. The temperature of the molecular layer (derived\nfrom $^{13}$CO and HCO$^+$) is on the order of 16 K. HCO$^+$ 3-2 being\nthermalized, we derive a lower limit for the H$_2$ volume density of $\\sim 3\n\\times 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ at radius 100-200 au between 1 and 2 scale heights. The\natmosphere temperature of the CO gas is of the order $\\sim$ 31 K at a radius of\n100 au. We directly observe CO and HCO$^+$ gas onto the mid-plane beyond the\ndust outer radius ($\\ge 300$ au).

We have determined Sr abundance in a sample of 31 red giant branch\nstars located in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc with the aim to identify\npotential differences in the Sr abundance between first population (1P,\nNa-poor) and second population (2P, Na-rich) stars. Methods. We derived the Na\nand Sr abundances from the archival spectra obtained with the UVES\nspectrograph. To do this, we used 1D ATLAS9 model atmospheres and a 1D local\nthermodynamic equilibrium spectral synthesis method. Particular attention was\npaid to assessing the potential impact of CN line blending on the obtained Sr\nabundances. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential influence of convection on\nthe Sr line formation by using 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres computed\nwith the CO5BOLD code. Results. Our results suggest a weak correlation between\nthe abundances of Sr and Na. Together with a similar correlation between the\nabundances of Zr and Na determined in our previous study, our analysis of Sr\nsuggests that polluters that have enriched 2P stars with light elements may\nhave produced some s-process elements as well. The mean Sr abundance determined\nin 31 red giant branch stars of 47~Tuc is $\\langle {\\rm [Sr/Fe]} \\rangle =\n0.18\\pm0.08$ (the error denotes the standard deviation due to the star-to-star\nabundance scatter). This value is within the range of the Sr abundance\nvariation that is observed in Galactic field stars of similar metallicity. The\nmean [Sr/Zr] abundance ratio in our sample stars suggests that the two\ns-process elements could have been synthesized by either low-mass asymptotic\ngiant branch stars ($M=1-4 {\\rm M}_{\\odot}$) or massive ($M=10-20 {\\rm\nM}_{\\odot}$) fast-rotating ($v_{\\rm rot}=200-300$ km/s) stars."}

We\nbuild a convolutional denoising autoencoder (DAE) for galaxy model subtraction:\nimages are compressed to a latent representation and reconstructed to yield the\nsmooth galaxy, suppressing other objects. The DAE is trained on\nGALFIT-generated model galaxies injected into real sky backgrounds and tested\non real images from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). To\nquantify performance, we conduct an injection-recovery experiment on residual\nimages by adding mock globular clusters (GCs) with known fluxes and positions.\nOur tests confirm a higher recovery rate of mock GCs near galaxy centers for\ncomplex morphologies, while matching ellipse fitting for smooth ellipticals.\nOverall, the DAE achieves subtraction equivalent to isophotal ellipse fitting\nfor regular ellipticals and superior results for galaxies with high\nellipticities or spiral features. Photometry of small-scale sources on DAE\nresiduals is consistent with that on ellipse-subtracted residuals.
