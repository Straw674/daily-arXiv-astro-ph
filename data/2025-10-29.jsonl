The initial cores follow critical Bonnor-Ebert\nprofiles and are embedded in environments with different ambient densities. The\nsimulations follow the evolution at least until the envelope mass within a\nradius equal to twice the critical Bonnor-Ebert radius drops to 35% of the\ninitial cloud mass. We reveal that in environments with higher external\ndensity, enhanced mass inflow from the envelope leads to Bondi-like accretion\nas the protostellar mass increases. The continued inflow substantially\nincreases the final stellar mass, resulting in star formation efficiencies that\nappear to exceed unity in dense environments. The external medium also\ninfluences the evolution of circumstellar disks and protostellar outflows: with\nthe high-density external medium, disks grow rapidly but their mass becomes\nsmaller relative to the protostellar mass, and the outflow is sustained over a\nlong duration. However, the ratio of angular momentum removed by outflows and\nmagnetic braking to that introduced by inflowing gas decreases with increasing\nexternal density.

Several studies have explored LNSS architecture\nusing geometric analysis in both near and distant lunar orbits. The existing\nLNSS optimization efforts have primarily focused on global lunar coverage using\nanalytical station-keeping models with low accuracy. Furthermore, current south\npole-focused research is restricted to Elliptical Lunar Frozen Orbits (ELFOs)\nand lacks comprehensive optimization approach. Additionally, integration with\nEarth GNSS systems for ephemeris computation and time synchronization has not\nbeen adequately addressed in prior studies. In this work, we present a\ncomprehensive LNSS mission design framework based on evolutionary\nmulti-objective optimization integrated with a high-fidelity numerical lunar\norbit propagation model. The optimization simultaneously considers navigation\nperformance in the lunar south pole region, semi-analytical continuous\nstation-keeping maneuver model for realistic dV estimate, and GPS-LNSS\nintegration analysis parameters. The resulting Pareto front offers a diverse\nset of LNSS configurations that balance coverage, accuracy, and dV\nrequirements. Notably, the optimization identifies diverse non-frozen\nelliptical orbit solutions that achieve over 90% south pole coverage with\nacceptable navigation accuracy using as few as six satellites and dV of less\nthan 0.4 km/s per satellite per year. This represents a significant reduction\nin constellation size compared to previous studies, offering a cost-effective\nyet operationally efficient solution for future LNSS missions."}

By\nadopting this interpretation, one can then take advantage of many different\napproaches in order to investigate the phenomenon of gravitationally induced\nparticle creation. One of these approaches relies on the so-called irreversible\nthermodynamics of open systems formalism. By considering the scalar--tensor\nformulation of one of these theories, we derive the corresponding particle\ncreation rate, creation pressure, and entropy production, demonstrating that\nirreversible particle creation can drive a late-time de Sitter acceleration\nthrough a negative creation pressure, providing a natural alternative to the\ncosmological constant.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Observations of $\\gamma$-rays from diffuse gas provide the opportunity to\nstudy the distribution of high energy particles in different astrophysical\nenvironments. In the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the intracluster medium\n(ICM), it is expected that relativistic cosmic rays collide with thermal\nparticles and produce $\\gamma$-rays through pion decay. The $\\gamma$-ray\nluminosity of a plasma depends on where cosmic rays are: if they are in denser\ngas, they produce more $\\gamma$-rays. In this work, we study how different\ncosmic-ray transport mechanisms impact the $\\gamma$-ray luminosity of a\nturbulent, multiphase medium formed from an initially diffuse medium. Two\nquantities set the luminosity: the average cosmic-ray energy density and the\ncorrelation of cosmic-ray energy and gas density. Overall, cosmic rays must\nescape cold dense regions in order to produce less $\\gamma$-ray emission and be\nconsistent with observations. Our simulations with fast transport mechanisms\n(either diffusion or streaming) are degenerate: they each produce a lower\n$\\gamma$-ray luminosity than slow transport simulations by two orders of\nmagnitude. This result means that fast transport (particularly in dense clumps)\nis necessary for simulations to agree with the dearth of observations of\n$\\gamma$-ray emission from diffuse gas like the CGM and ICM. We also show the\nsignificant difference in luminosity is the result of cosmic-ray\nreacceleration. This reacceleration is different from the turbulent\nreacceleration described by Ptuskin (1988). Instead, condensing, cold clouds\ndrive a significant increase in the average cosmic-ray energy and, as a result,\nthe $\\gamma$-ray luminosity."}

By stacking the\nclassified population and comparing with the Galactic Ridge X-ray Emission\n(GRXE), we estimate that $\\sim 6\\%$ of the GRXE flux in the\n$0.5$--$2.0\\,\\text{keV}$ band is resolved into point sources above the eRASS1\nflux limit ($\\sim 5\\times\n10^{-14}\\,\\text{erg}\\,\\text{cm}^{-2}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$). This resolved soft-band\nemission is dominated by active stars, while hard-band flux originates\nprimarily from X-ray binaries. We conclude that the eRASS1 catalog retains a\nnon-negligible population of compact objects that can be effectively\ndistinguished using X-ray color selection."}

However, identifying super-Eddington accreting quasars\nobservationally is challenging due to uncertain black-hole mass estimates and\nother complications. The Eddington ratio parameter does not represent\naccurately the accretion rate in the super-Eddington regime. On the other hand,\nsuper-Eddington accreting quasars appear to show large hard X-ray (rest-frame >\n2 keV) power-law photon indices, and they also exhibit distinct optical\nspectral features including weak [O III] $\\lambda 5007$ emission and strong Fe\nII emission. We test steep X-ray photon-index selection of super-Eddington\naccreting quasars by obtaining Palomar 200-inch Hale Telescope near-infrared\nspectra for a pilot sample of nine $\\Gamma=2.0-2.6$ quasars at\n$z\\approx1.4-2.5$. We derive H$\\beta$-based single-epoch virial black-hole\nmasses (median value $\\rm 4.3 \\times 10^{8}~M_{\\odot}$) and Eddington ratios\n(median value 0.6). The Eddington ratio distribution is consistent with that of\nthe comparison sample, which is a flux-limited sample of quasars at\n$z\\approx1.5-3.5$ with near-infrared spectroscopy. But our super-Eddington\ncandidates do show statistically weaker [O III] emission ($P_{\\rm\nnull}=0.0075$) and marginally stronger Fe II emission ($P_{\\rm null}=0.06$). We\nalso find one candidate with broad (width of 1960 km/s) and blueshifted (690\nkm/s) [O III] $\\lambda 4959$ and [O III] $\\lambda 5007$ lines, which probably\noriginate from a strong [O III] outflow driven by super-Eddington accretion.\nOverall, the steep X-ray photon-index selection of super-Eddington accreting\nquasars appears promising. But a larger sample is needed to assess further the\nreliability of the selection."}

Submitted to ApJ", "summary": "A tidal disruption event (TDE) occurs when a star passes within the tidal\nradius of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). In TDEs it is expected that the\norbital angular momentum of the disrupted star is generally misaligned with the\nSMBH spin axis, which should result in a misaligned super-Eddington disk\nprecessing around the SMBH spin axis due to the Lense-Thirring effect. In this\npaper, we investigate the distinct observational signatures produced from such\nTDE disks, by performing radiative transfer calculations upon previous\nsuper-Eddington disk simulations. We demonstrate that the precession of the\ndisk and wind drive time-dependent obscuration and reprocessing of X-ray\nradiation. Depending on the orientation of the viewing angle of the observer\nand the tilt angle of the disk, four main types of variability are induced: 1)\nThe smooth-TDEs: The emissions from these TDEs show no fluctuations; 2) The\ndimmer: The main emission type (X-ray or optical) stays the same, with small to\nmoderate modulations of brightness; 3) The blinker: X-ray and optical emissions\ntake turns to dominate in one cycle of precession, with dramatic changes in the\nX-ray fluxes. 4) The siren: X-ray and optical emissions take over each other\ntwice per cycle, possibly with two different peak X-ray fluxes within one\ncycle. In all three scenarios, we observe an inverse correlation between X-ray\nand optical emissions. Our model provides a unified physical framework for\ninterpreting TDE multi-wavelength variability through disk precession dynamics\nand gives an alternative interpretation to the interesting case of\nJ045650.3-203750 which was suggested to be a repeated partial TDE previously."}

This approach directly detects,\nclassifies, and analyzes spectral traces from raw 2D images, bypassing\ntraditional, error-accumulating pipelines. YOLOv5 effectively detects both\ncompact zero-order and extended first-order traces even in highly crowded\nfields. Building on this, YOLO11 integrates source classification (star/galaxy)\nand discrete astrophysical parameter estimation (e.g., redshift bins),\nshowcasing complete spectral trace analysis without other manual preprocessing.\nOur framework processes large images rapidly, learning spectral-spatial\nfeatures holistically to minimize errors. We achieve high trace detection\nprecision (YOLOv5) and demonstrate successful quasar identification and binned\nredshift estimation (YOLO11). This study establishes machine learning as a\nparadigm shift in slitless spectroscopy, unifying detection, classification,\nand preliminary parameter estimation in a scalable system.

Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics (referee\n  stage: minor revisions)", "summary": "Growing observational evidence suggests that Class II protoplanetary disks\nmay undergo substantial interactions with their environment in the form of late\ninfall. This mass inflow predominantly manifests itself in the form of\nso-called streamers: filaments and arcs of gas connecting large-scale, extended\ngas structures to disk scales. Prevalent late infall has far-reaching\nconsequences for planet formation theory, challenging the long-standing\ntreatment of evolved disks in isolation. In this work, we investigate the\nemergence of late-infall streamers in different formation scenarios, their\nmorphology and multiplicity, as well as their dependence on environmental\nconditions. We conduct this investigation by performing 3D hydrodynamical\nsimulation using the grid-based code FARGO3D, which we post-process to obtain\nsynthetic observations using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code RADMC3D.\nWe find that, while a late infall event in the form of a single encounter with\na \"cloudlet\" of gas can produce a streamer via an interplay between the\nfall-back of bound material and shocks, such features dissipate quickly, on a\ntimescale of ~10 kyr. Furthermore, we find that streamers can also form\nnaturally in a turbulent, dense environment without the need for such\nencounters, which could act to reconcile short-lived streamers with ubiquitous\ndetection of these structures. Here, we find multiple co-existing streamers for\na disk velocity relative to the interstellar medium of\n$v_\\mathrm{sys}=0.5~\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and a turbulent velocity\ndispersion of $\\sigma_\\mathrm{turb}=0.5~\\mathrm{km}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We find\nconsiderable dependence of the streamer morphology on the environment, which\nmay act as a utility to constrain the physical conditions of the gas\nsurrounding planet-forming disk, and therefore the conditions under which\nplanets form."}
