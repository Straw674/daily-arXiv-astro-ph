In this paper, we analyze how the uncertainty in the dark matter speed distribution near the Sun is affected by baryonic feedback, halo-to-halo variance, and halo mass. To do so, we harness the statistical power of the new DREAMS Cold Dark Matter simulation suite, which is comprised of 1024 zoom-in Milky Way-mass halos with varied initial conditions as well as cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Applying a normalizing flows emulator to these simulations, we find that the uncertainty in the local DM speed distribution is dominated by halo-to-halo variance and, to a lesser extent, uncertainty in host halo mass. Uncertainties in supernova and black hole feedback (from the IllustrisTNG model in this case) are negligible in comparison. Using the DREAMS suite, we present a state-of-the-art prediction for the DM speed distribution in the Milky Way. Although the Standard Halo Model is contained within the uncertainty of this prediction, individual galaxies may have distributions that differ from it. Lastly, we apply our DREAMS results to the XENON1T experiment and demonstrate that the astrophysical uncertainties are comparable to the experimental ones, solidifying previous results in the literature obtained with a smaller sample of simulated Milky Way-mass halos."}

A central challenge is to determine whether these deviations reflect genuine dynamical dark energy behavior or instead arise from cross-probe inconsistencies, prior choices, or mismatches in likelihood construction. Previous work demonstrated that imposing a biased supernova-motivated prior on Omega_{m0} can artificially displace the BAO-inferred w_0,w_a values from the LambdaCDM expectation. A complementary pedagogic study further showed that the differing degeneracy geometries of BAO, CMB, and SNe can generate apparent dark energy evolution even when the underlying cosmology is exactly LambdaCDM. In this manuscript, we develop a controlled tension injection framework that provides a systematic means of quantifying how probe-level tensions influence inferred dark energy parameters. Self-consistent BAO, CMB, and SNe mock datasets are augmented with parameterized shifts in (Omega_{m0}, H_0), supernova absolute calibration, and the BAO sound-horizon scale $r_d$. The resulting datasets are analyzed through a unified MCMC pipeline, enabling a direct assessment of how these controlled tensions propagate into biases in (w_0, w_a) and the pivot equation-of-state parameter w_p. This forecasting framework provides practical guidance for identifying probe combinations that are most susceptible to spurious signatures of dynamical dark energy, and helps ensure robust multi-probe inference in forthcoming precision surveys."}

Once thought to be highly transient, our results demonstrate otherwise. Our sample consists of nine massive ($>10^{10.5}\\,\\rm M_{\\odot}$) star-forming barred-spiral galaxies at $z_{\\rm spec} \\sim 1.5$. Using rest-frame near-IR (F444W) JWST/NIRCam imaging, we apply ellipse fitting along with 1D and 2D morphological modeling to directly measure bar properties. We find that five galaxies host flat surface brightness profiles (bar Sérsic index $<0.4$), indicative of highly evolved, \"mature\" bars. By contrast, only two galaxies show exponential profiles, characteristic of young bars, and these are also shorter in absolute length than the flat bars. We therefore conclude that a large fraction of bars at this epoch have already matured, thereby indicating the presence of well-settled disks required to facilitate bar formation and sustained evolution well before $z\\sim1.5$. To assess the gravitational impact of the bars, we calculate the maximum transverse-to-radial force ratio ($Q_{b}$). We find that $Q_{b}$ values are comparable to, or weaker than, those of bars in the local Universe, Seven of the nine bars show only a marginal increase in strength with maturity (from exponential to flat bars). Contrarily however, the remaining two bars are flat, but have the lowest $Q_{b}$ values in our sample. We hence propose that the mature bars at $z\\sim 1.5$ may experience phases of weakening due to rapid gas inflows and/or minor mergers. In conclusion, our work sheds light on the rapidly evolving nature of high-z bars and paves the way for larger statistical studies."}

The velocity gradient, together with the projected post-shock flow velocity of $\\approx 300$ km/s, is well described by a simple shock-compression model of a supersonic object, with a velocity of $v_{BH} = 954^{+110}_{-126}$ km/s and an inclination $i=29^{+6}_{-3}$ deg. The previously puzzling kinematics along the linear feature, with the observed radial velocity decreasing from $\\approx 300$ km/s near the tip to $\\approx 100$ km/s closer to the former host galaxy, are naturally explained as gradual downstream mixing of shocked gas with the circumgalactic medium through turbulent entrainment. The runaway black hole interpretation is further supported by the morphology of the gas at the tip of the wake and an analysis of the [OIII]/H$α$, [NII]/H$α$, [SII]/H$α$, and [SIII]/[SII] line ratios. The line ratios are consistent with fast radiative shocks and rapid cooling, with best-fit shock velocities that are in good agreement with expectations from the black hole velocity and the shock geometry. Energy conservation over the lifetime of the wake suggests a SMBH mass of $M_{BH} \\gtrsim 10^7$ M$_{\\odot}$. These results confirm that the wake is powered by a supersonic runaway supermassive black hole, a long-predicted consequence of gravitational-wave recoil or multi-body ejection from galactic nuclei."}

Companion paper to arXiv:2504.13251", "summary": "How is the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) in single-field models of inflation impacted by the presence of additional scalar fields? We consider the effect of a spectator field - a free scalar field with sub-Hubble mass, no direct coupling to the inflaton, and which makes a subdominant contribution to the total energy density - in the context of single-field models of inflation featuring a transient phase of ultra-slow roll (USR) evolution. Despite the modest title, a spectator field can have a dramatic impact: the slow-roll evolution of the spectator prevents the combined inflaton-and-spectator system from entering into USR, which naively might be expected to preclude the production of PBHs. However, we demonstrate that the growth of perturbations is maintained or enhanced by the spectator, through the rich interplay of curvature and isocurvature perturbations. We show in a model-independent way that the single-field phase of ultra-slow-roll is replaced by two turns in field space encompassing a phase of tachyonic instability for the isocurvature perturbations and a transfer of power from isocurvature to curvature modes. Furthermore, we highlight a degeneracy between the fine-tuning of the feature in the inflaton potential and the parameters of the spectator, leading to an overall resilience of model predictions to parameter variations. This makes it easier for the underlying PBH model to accommodate both high-precision CMB constraints and production of PBHs in the asteroid-mass range."}

The rich imaging data it collects will be an invaluable resource for probing galaxy evolution across cosmic time, characterizing the host galaxies of transient phenomena, and identifying novel populations of anomalous systems. While machine learning models have shown promise for extracting galaxy features from multi-band astronomical imaging, the large dimensionality of the learned latent space presents a challenge for mechanistic interpretability studies. In this work, we present Minuet, a low-dimensional diffusion autoencoder for multi-band galaxy imaging. Minuet is trained to reconstruct 72x72-pixel $grz$ image cutouts of 6M galaxies within $z<1$ from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey using only five latent dimensions. By using a diffusion model conditioned on the transformer-based autoencoder's output for image reconstruction, we achieve semantically-meaningful latent representations of galaxy images while still allowing for high-fidelity, probabilistic reconstructions. We train a series of binary classifiers on Minuet's latent features to quantify their connection to morphological labels from Galaxy Zoo, and a conditional flow to produce posterior distributions of SED-derived redshifts, stellar masses, and star-formation rates. We further show the value of Minuet for nearest neighbor searches in the learned latent space. Minuet provides strong evidence for the low intrinsic dimensionality of galaxy imaging, and introduces a class of astrophysical models that produce highly compact representations for diverse science goals."}

In a sample of 16 Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs) without previous black-hole mass measurements we discover 8 UMBHs based on direct dynamical detections with triaxial Schwarzschild models. This first sample of triaxial black-hole mass determinations increases the number of known UMBHs by a factor of two and dramatically increases the constraints for BH mass scaling relations at the high-mass end. We find that BCGs are outliers in the canonical BH - $σ$ relation, while the size of their depleted cores - the central light-deficient region - is a much better unbiased predictor of the black hole mass and should be used as a proxy at the high-mass end. BCGs smoothly join the trend already established for massive core galaxies in previous studies. This also holds for tight correlations between core size and sphere-of-influence radius and core size and core density. All these relations strongly support the black-hole binary model for the formation of the centers of the most massive galaxies."}

Recent cosmological simulations such as FLAMINGO calibrate their feedback model on the baryon fractions of galaxy groups to tune the efficiency of gas ejection. However, recent observational constraints from optically selected groups and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect yield lower baryon fractions than previous studies, which indicates that feedback may be more ejective than previously thought. Here we show that models involving highly ejective feedback are inconsistent with the scaling relations of local galaxy groups in the mass range $10^{13}-10^{14}M_\\odot$. We study the X-ray luminosity-temperature relation in a sample of 44 galaxy groups with high-quality XMM-Newton observations. We show that highly ejective models under-predict the luminosity of galaxy groups at fixed mass at high significance ($5.7σ$). This conclusion is robust against selection effects and is obtained from directly measurable and minimally correlated quantities. We point out that turning observable quantities into gas fraction estimates is challenging, especially in the context of stacking large samples of heterogeneous systems. We argue that calibrating feedback models on baryon fractions is prone to systematic uncertainties and that observable scaling relations are better suited for this task."}

Under review at MNRAS - further comments from the community welcome", "summary": "Using a high-resolution simulation of a dwarf galaxy, we quantify the energetic importance of magnetic fields within the different phases of its interstellar medium (ISM) on parsec scales. We show that, whilst overall the magnetic field is only energetically dominant for a small fraction of the ISM, it becomes important in the thermally unstable regime (45.2% of the mass is magnetically dominated), and in the majority of the cold neutral medium (66.1% of the mass). In the molecular gas, the magnetic field dominates more of the total mass budget (39.8%) than thermal energy, turbulent kinetic energy, or gas self-gravitating potential energy. However, much of this gas will be CO-dark. This suggests that magnetic forces are non-negligible during the formation of cold dense gas, which will slow its collapse and lead to an increase in the fraction of cold atomic, and molecular gas in the ISM. Consequently, star-forming clouds may be surrounded by a larger reservoir of cold gas than would otherwise be expected."}

However, current evidence relies on small samples, leaving open whether bars play a significant role during stripping. In this study, we analyse a sample about five times larger than those used in previous works, comprising 176 galaxies identified as RPS candidates based on optical morphological indicators such as asymmetries, debris tails, and displaced star-forming regions. To assess the impact of these processes, we examine radial $u-r$ colour profiles from SDSS imaging as tracers of the specific star formation rate (sSFR). We classify galaxies by bar presence and RPS signatures, and construct comparison samples through stepwise matching in stellar mass and environment to disentangle the individual and combined effects of bars and RPS on stellar population gradients. Our results show that central rejuvenation signals emerge in RPS candidate galaxies, becoming most evident when bars and RPS act together. Barred RPS galaxies are systematically bluer at all radii than their non-RPS counterparts, while unbarred systems display only mild or no central differences, suggesting that the observable outcome of RPS depends on the stripping stage. Furthermore, barred galaxies exhibit flatter central colour profiles than unbarred ones -- a robust signature across all matched configurations. These findings highlight the key role of bars in amplifying environmental effects on the stellar populations of jellyfish galaxies, underscoring how internal structures can modulate the observable signatures of environmental processes in galaxies."}

In this paper we place constraints on local, equilateral, and orthogonal non-Gaussianities using the power spectrum and bispectrum extracted from first public release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our analysis makes use of higher-order clustering information through a consistent effective field theory (EFT) model for both the power spectrum and bispectrum at one-loop order.

These measurements, used to determine object positions, motions, and fluxes, are based on observational models that have evolved from empirical centroiding rules to rigorous probabilistic formulations at the pixel level. This review summarizes key contributions that formalized this transition and analyzes seminal works addressing both the theoretical limits and the empirical performance of estimators. Central to these developments is the derivation of fundamental bounds, such as the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), and the assessment of widely used estimators, including Maximum Likelihood (ML), Least Squares (LS), and Weighted Least Squares (WLS). These studies show that, while the CRLB sets a theoretical benchmark, practical estimators achieve it only under specific signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, with notable discrepancies in high-SNR conditions. Moreover, recent results demonstrate that jointly estimating source flux and background significantly improves photometric precision compared to sequential approaches. Looking ahead, the increasing complexity of astronomical surveys, driven by massive data volumes, dynamic observational conditions, and the integration of machine learning, poses new challenges to reliable inference. In this context, tools from statistical theory, including performance bounds and theoretically grounded estimators, remain critical to guide algorithm design and ensure robust astrometric and photometric pipelines."}

If ultra-light RPBHs dominated the early Universe, the initial isocurvature perturbation is converted into curvature perturbation that induce second-order GW background upon evaporation of RPBHs. The upper limit of extra relativistic degrees of freedom $ΔN_{\\rm eff}$, which could be inferred from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis or Cosmic Microwave Background observations, places a constraint on the maximum energy density of GW, which in turn can be used to constrain the RPBH population. As RPBHs have different lifetime from their singular counterparts, the constraint must be modified accordingly. While the formalism that we provide is generic, we work out explicitly the case of Simpson-Visser metric for demonstration. The RPBHs associated with this metric have lower Hawking temperature and smaller horizon size, leading to a longer lifetime than the singular Schwarzschild black holes. This implies a stronger constraint on RPBH population as they dominate the Universe for a longer period of time and generate stronger GW."}

The filters with different spectral transmittance can be cut into the optical path at different times by this mechanism. Because the image contrast of space coronagraph is very high, the high stability requirement for the optical unit of coronagraph is put forward. Small modulus worm gear and worm are taken by the mechanism, in order to realize compact structure, high stiffness, the unidirectional 360 degrees rotation and reverse self-locking function. The precision, stiffness, mechanical properties and reliability of the mechanism are analyzed in the paper. The results show that the position accuracy of the filter wheel can meet the requirement of 0.5mm. The first order modal of the mechanism is 313Hz. The results of vibration test indicate that stiffness, dynamic performance and reliability of the mechanism can be meet. Therefore, the design of filter wheel in this paper can ensure the multi-spectral imaging requirements under complex spatial conditions."}

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Little red dots (LRDs) newly discovered with JWST are active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may represent black hole (BH) growth at the earliest cosmic epochs. These sources show puzzling features unlike typical AGNs, including red optical continua, weak hot-dust emission, and a lack of detectable X-rays. Previously, LRDs have often been interpreted as dust-reddened AGNs, leading to severe inconsistencies with the luminosity and BH mass densities inferred for previously known AGNs over $0<z<5$. The BH-envelope (BHE) model has been proposed to explain these characteristics, in which an accreting BH is enshrouded by a dense, optically thick gaseous envelope. In this Letter, we reanalyze the SEDs of $\\sim 400$ photometric LRDs in the COSMOS-Web survey using the BHE model and reassess their implications for cosmological BH evolution. We find that the optical-NIR spectra of LRDs are well reproduced by blackbody emission with an effective temperatures of $4000-6000~\\K$. Within the BHE framework, the inferred bolometric luminosities decrease by $\\gtrsim1-2$ orders of magnitude compared to dust-reddened AGN assumptions. As a result, the revised luminosity function, BH accretion density, and BH mass function become consistent with those of AGNs at $z<5$. The stellar masses of LRD hosts are estimated by attributing the UV excesses to star formation. Although the resulting $M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\star$ ratio remains higher than the local empirical value, the excess is modest. Overall, the BHE model not only resolves the spectral features of LRDs but also brings their statistical properties into agreement with the broader cosmological BH population."}

From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $ζ[ζ_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $δN$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\\sim \\mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles."}

The location of the surface detector array on the shore of Lake Baikal is motivated by the fact that permanent placement of detectors on the surface of the lake is challenging. Within the given geometry, simultaneous registration is possible for EAS with a zenith angle of about 76 degrees within the limited solid angle. The corresponding inclined EAS are dominated by muons and significantly attenuated. The installation will make it possible to obtain an estimate of the number of high-energy muons in EAS. This, subsequently, would make it possible to verify EAS modeling and calculations of the atmospheric neutrino flux. The detector may also be used for cross-calibration of energy and direction measurements by the neutrino telescope. We use the CORSIKA program to simulate the registration of EAS on the shore close to the Baikal-GVD. The propagation of ultra-high energy muons produced by EAS through 3.5 km of water and their registration by Baikal-GVD is simulated using the PROPOSAL package. We calculate the minimal total area of the onshore detectors suitable for several cosmic ray energy thresholds, starting from 1 PeV.

Using the measured foreground redshift, background redshift, and integrated flux of the background [O II] doublet, we integrate over impact parameters to compute the probability that each candidate is a lens. We expect 53% of candidates to be true lenses with Einstein radii ranging from 0.1'' to 4'', which can be confirmed with high-resolution imaging. Confirmed strong lenses from this sample will form a valuable cosmological dataset, as strong gravitational lensing is the only method to directly measure dark matter halo substructure at cosmological distances. We independently recover the host of the multiply imaged gravitationally lensed type Ia supernova iPTF16geu (Goobar et al. 2017).

In this work, we model 27 additional lenses, extending our sample of LOS shear constraints to 45 in total. We find a mean shear magnitude of $0.11\\pm 0.024$, showing that a significant fraction of the lenses modelled in this work possess LOS shears with unexpectedly large magnitudes, $|γ_{\\rm LOS}| > 0.1$, even when an octupolar distortion is included in the lens mass. We further investigate if factors such as lens and source redshift, filter and PSF, or flux and signal-to-noise ratio in the lensed arcs correlate with shear. We find that none of these features play a statistically significant role in the production of unusually large shear magnitudes."}

We used data obtained with the 15 GHz VLBA in MJD 54838-60262 and data from the 15 GHz OVRO 40 m single dish telescope in MJD 54474-59023. We used a variability timescale and a causality argument of a linear size to measure the angular diameter distance to the source. To constrain the Doppler factor, we applied the relation between the rest-frame brightness temperature of the emission region and the observed brightness temperature. To calculate the observed brightness temperature, the angular size and flux density variation of the emission region are required. The angular size of the emission region (i.e., the VLBA core) was obtained from a FWHM, which is a circular Gaussian model-fitting parameter that ranges from 0.048-0.228 mas, and its uncertainty is determined to be 1.8-13 %. Using the OVRO SD light curve, we obtained a variability timescale of $128.0_{-0.3}^{+0.2}$ days and a peak flux density of $1.750_{-0.104}^{+0.015}$ Jy for the largest flare that peaked on MJD $58921.7_{-5.5}^{+2.6}$. We assumed a disk brightness geometry, equipartition brightness temperature ($5\\times10^{10}$ K), and perfect radius. Using the VLBA core sizes obtained near the flare peaks, we found consistent distance measurement results with the $Λ$CDM model within 1$σ$ uncertainties. We suggest that the best distance from the source is $941_{-64}^{+59}$ Mpc, which is comparable with the $Λ$CDM distance of $948.2\\pm13.5$ Mpc. The distance measurement should indeed be taken at the peak of a flare. We found that the decomposed timescale allowed us to obtain consistent distances with the $Λ$CDM. We strongly suggest to decompose light curves when the variability timescales are to be obtained properly."}

The spectral index $n_s$ of the primordial power spectrum provides a window into early universe, and constraints on $n_s$ play an important role in discriminating early universe models such as models of cosmic inflation. Historically constrained by cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, the constraints on $n_s$ shift upward when CMB data is combined with the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Recent work explained the origin of this and the relation to the BAO-CMB tension between CMB experiments and DESI BAO, and as a case study presented constraints on $n_s$ from the combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 data and DESI DR2 data. Here we present constraints from Planck (PR3 and PR4), ACT, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the combination of all three CMB experiments, CMB-SPA, with and without DESI DR2 BAO data, and with and without CMB lensing data. In all cases the constraint on $n_s$ is shifted upwards when DESI is included, with the largest shift exhibited by ACT. This is accompanied by a commensurate shift in the constraint on the optical depth to reionization $τ$, which is again greatest for ACT. When CMB data are combined into CMB-SPA and combined with DESI the $n_s$ constraint disfavors at more than $2σ$ the inflation models preferred by Planck alone, such as Higgs, Starobinsky, and exponential $α$-attractors, in favor of other models, such as polynomial $α$-attractors. This work motivates the further study of the tension between CMB and DESI BAO data, and of the rich interplay between $n_s$ and $τ$."}

These large area observations can contain various and superposed structures such as point sources, extended objects, and large-scale diffuse emission.

We introduce aim-resolve, an automatic and iterative method that combines the Bayesian imaging algorithm resolve with deep learning and clustering algorithms in order to jointly solve the reconstruction and source extraction problem. The method identifies and models different astrophysical components in radio observations while providing uncertainty quantification of the results. By using different model descriptions for point sources, extended objects, and diffuse background emission, the method efficiently separates the individual components and improves the overall reconstruction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on synthetic image data containing multiple different sources. We further show the application of aim-resolve to an L-band (856 - 1712 MHz) MeerKAT observation of the radio galaxy ESO 137-006 and other radio galaxies in that environment. We observe a reasonable object identification for both applications, yielding a clean separation of the individual components and precise reconstructions of point sources and extended objects along with detailed uncertainty quantification. In particular, the method enables the creation of catalogs containing source positions and brightnesses and the corresponding uncertainties.

While the global properties of galaxies are significantly affected by changes in feedback, the H I mass-size relation remains intact. Moreover, its parameters consistently align with the best available empirical measurements.

In this paper, we analyze how the uncertainty in the dark matter speed distribution near the Sun is affected by baryonic feedback, halo-to-halo variance, and halo mass. To do so, we harness the statistical power of the new DREAMS Cold Dark Matter simulation suite, which is comprised of 1024 zoom-in Milky Way-mass halos with varied initial conditions as well as cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Applying a normalizing flows emulator to these simulations, we find that the uncertainty in the local DM speed distribution is dominated by halo-to-halo variance and, to a lesser extent, uncertainty in host halo mass. Uncertainties in supernova and black hole feedback (from the IllustrisTNG model in this case) are negligible in comparison. Using the DREAMS suite, we present a state-of-the-art prediction for the DM speed distribution in the Milky Way. Although the Standard Halo Model is contained within the uncertainty of this prediction, individual galaxies may have distributions that differ from it. Lastly, we apply our DREAMS results to the XENON1T experiment and demonstrate that the astrophysical uncertainties are comparable to the experimental ones, solidifying previous results in the literature obtained with a smaller sample of simulated Milky Way-mass halos."}

While spectroscopy provides precise measurements, it is observationally expensive, and photometry discards morphological information that correlates with mass, star formation history, metallicity, and dust. We present a conditional flow matching (CFM) framework that leverages pixel-level imaging alongside photometry to improve posterior inference of galaxy properties. Using $\\sim10^5$ SDSS galaxies, we compare models trained on photometry alone versus photometry plus images. The image+photometry model outperforms the photometry-only model in posterior inference and more reliably recovers known scaling relations. Morphological information also helps mitigate the dust--age degeneracy. Our results highlight the potential of integrating morphology into photometric SED fitting pipelines, opening a pathway towards more accurate and physically informed constraints on galaxy properties."}

In this work, we introduce a framework that leverages Flow Matching and Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) to jointly infer the parameters of the GD-1 progenitor and the global properties of the Milky Way potential. Our aim is to move beyond traditional techniques (e.g. orbit-fitting and action-angle methods) by constructing a fully Bayesian, likelihood-free posterior over both host-galaxy parameters and progenitor properties, thereby capturing the intrinsic coupling between tidal stripping dynamics and the underlying potential. To achieve this, we generate a large suite of mock GD-1-like streams using our differentiable N-body code \\textsc{\\texttt{Odisseo}}, sampling self-consistent initial conditions from a Plummer sphere and evolving them in a flexible Milky Way potential model. We then apply conditional Flow Matching to learn the vector field that transports a base Gaussian distribution into the posterior, enabling efficient, amortized inference directly from stream phase-space data. We demonstrate that our method successfully recovers the true parameters of a fiducial GD-1 simulation, producing well-calibrated posteriors and accurately reproducing parameter degeneracies arising from progenitor-host interactions. Flow Matching provides a powerful, flexible framework for Galactic Archaeology. Our approach enables joint inference on progenitor and Galactic parameters, capturing complex dependencies that are difficult to model with classical likelihood-based methods."}

Such a special electroweak vacuum is singled out by lying close to the critical boundary of a phase transition, as recently explored in a new class of cosmological solutions to the hierarchy problem. They generically predict the Higgs potential to be destabilised just above the weak scale. Intriguingly, the requirement for new physics to achieve this coincides with two independently well-motivated expectations: a split spectrum of light fermions and heavy bosons, as anticipated from naturalness, and the so-called \"WIMP miracle\". A WIMP with mass around the weak scale not only happens to have the correct thermal relic abundance to be the dark matter (DM), it can also give rise to the necessary critical boundary at the TeV scale through its Yukawa couplings to the Higgs. We use a higgsino-like singlet-doublet model to illustrate our Higgs-DM criticality scenario and show that if this WIMP DM mass is observed to be greater than ~1.2 TeV then it necessarily implies a strong bound on the Higgs mass and an upper bound on the scale of heavy new physics that restores vacuum stability. It can be thoroughly probed in direct detection experiments, astrophysical signals and future collider searches, further motivating a comprehensive exploration of the remaining heavy WIMP parameter space."}

The central stellar velocity dispersion is one of the fundamental dynamical tracers of the total mass of galaxy subhalos, alongside luminosity and stellar mass. Because it reflects the gravitational potential, the stellar velocity dispersion is expected to be relatively insensitive to feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), a critical process that regulates the connection between other galaxy observables and subhalo mass. To examine the impact of AGN feedback, we analyze the VDFs from five EAGLE simulation runs, each adopting a different AGN feedback model: one \"standard\", two \"enhanced\", one \"reduced\", and one with no AGN feedback. We compute the stellar velocity dispersions of pressure-supported galaxies using member stellar particles, mimicking fiber spectroscopy. The VDFs from the standard and enhanced AGN feedback models show little difference. However, contrary to our initial expectation that the VDF shape would be largely insensitive to AGN feedback, the simulations with reduced and no AGN feedback show a significant excess of high velocity dispersion galaxies ($σ_{*}$ > 200 km s$^{-1}$) and a deficit of low dispersion galaxies (100 < $σ_{*}$ (km s$^{-1}$) < 200), compared to those with standard or enhanced AGN feedback. The presence of high velocity dispersion galaxies in the no-AGN model arises from enhanced central star formation, due to the absence of AGN-driven gas heating or expulsion. Our results demonstrate that the shape of the theoretical VDF is sensitive to the strength of AGN feedback. These predictions offer a theoretical benchmark for future observational studies of the galaxy velocity dispersion function using large-scale spectroscopic surveys."}

The previously puzzling kinematics along the linear feature, with the observed radial velocity decreasing from $\\approx 300$ km/s near the tip to $\\approx 100$ km/s closer to the former host galaxy, are naturally explained as gradual downstream mixing of shocked gas with the circumgalactic medium through turbulent entrainment. The runaway black hole interpretation is further supported by the morphology of the gas at the tip of the wake and an analysis of the [OIII]/H$α$, [NII]/H$α$, [SII]/H$α$, and [SIII]/[SII] line ratios. The line ratios are consistent with fast radiative shocks and rapid cooling, with best-fit shock velocities that are in good agreement with expectations from the black hole velocity and the shock geometry. Energy conservation over the lifetime of the wake suggests a SMBH mass of $M_{BH} \\gtrsim 10^7$ M$_{\\odot}$. These results confirm that the wake is powered by a supersonic runaway supermassive black hole, a long-predicted consequence of gravitational-wave recoil or multi-body ejection from galactic nuclei."}

In their early, highly eccentric phases, these systems generate transient gravitational wave bursts during pericentre passages, separated by long quiescent intervals; we designate these signals ``popcorn EMRIs.'' We utilize a steady-state analytical model based on the continuity equation in phase space to estimate the population in a Milky Way-like galaxy. The normalization of this model is linked to the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation describing stellar relaxation. Adopting a conservative one-year observation baseline ($P>1$ year), we estimate the steady-state population of popcorn EMRIs. We forecast an observable burst rate of 5 to 44 events per year. The low duty cycle ($\\sim 10^{-4}$) confirms their manifestation as isolated transients. Individual bursts from the Galactic Centre exhibit high detectability. Analyzing these intrinsically transient signals demands a rigorous mathematical framework, as standard windowing techniques distort burst morphology. We establish an analytical foundation using standard smoothing techniques commonly used in real analysis. This yields the mathematically correct definition for the Fourier transform of transient signals, justifying the use of the direct Fourier transform without ad hoc windowing and ensuring the integrity of spectral analysis."}

The 1.3 mm continuum data reveal a distinct 0.1-pc arc and a perpendicular 0.04-pc tail. We propose that this morphology arises from a dynamic champagne flow: the slow expansion of HC H II region into a pre-existing filament forms the arc and associated low-velocity (few km s$^{-1}$) SiO shocks. Meanwhile, in the opposite direction ionized gas escapes along a steep density gradient traced by the tail and high-velocity (20 km s$^{-1}$) SiO emission. We reject the bow shock scenario in which ionized gas co-moves with a runaway high-mass star because shocked gas in the arc aligns with the hub velocity, contradicting the bow shock prediction. Non-LTE radiative transfer modeling further rules out infall of ionized gas as the velocity shift origin. We conclude that this exceptional HC H II region is undergoing a few-thousand-year transition phase of \"hatching out of the egg\": the ionized gas of HC H II region has just broken out of its parental hot core and now is flowing outward supersonically. This work highlights how anisotropic density distributions induce supersonically anisotropic ionized flows that govern HC H II region evolution."}

We demonstrate potentially observable consequences of inflation with a finite initial time in a model in five-dimensional warped anti-de Sitter space, with both a UV and an IR brane present during inflation. Considering an inflaton with an approximately flat potential localized on the UV brane, we derive the resulting brane motion in the bulk and the 4D effective action describing the dynamics. A concrete model allows us to evaluate possible consequences of a starting point of inflation. The background evolution is driven by the fast roll of the radion at early times and the slow roll of the inflaton at late times. We find that the action has the form of a two-field hyperbolic inflation model, the two fields being the radion and the inflaton, both of which have a time-dependent background solution. This setup is holographically dual to an inflaton coupled to a strongly coupled confined sector in which the confinement scale is larger than the Hubble scale, and a confinement scale whose ratio to the 4D Planck scale evolves cosmologically. Focusing on the period when the equation of state becomes that of inflation, we find that the presence of the IR brane leads to deviations from the approximate de Sitter background in addition to those from the slow-roll parameters of the inflaton potential. We quantify the effect of the presence of the IR brane on the two point function of the adiabatic scalar perturbations and tensor perturbations. The dominant deviations occur at large scales: the adiabatic power spectrum has a blue tilt, while the tensor power spectrum shows oscillatory features. We present numerical fits to the shape of the adiabatic power spectrum, and discuss the implications for cosmic microwave background (CMB) analysis."}

In PTA data sets with sufficiently long observational time span, this means that the Earth and pulsar terms' contributions to the CGW signal signature can eventually become resolvable. Since the pulsar term is accumulated incoherently and thus often treated as an additional source of noise, this separation can prove to be beneficial for the detection of the CGW signal in the PTA data set. We aim to investigate to what extent resolvable Earth and pulsar terms affect currently used techniques for CGW searches with PTA data sets, that treat the pulsar term as an additional source noise. We focus on the dependency of the pulsar term frequencies on the pulsar's distance. We aim to answer the question of whether adding more distant pulsars to a PTA data set can mitigate biases and improve the detection of CGWs. We show that under ideal conditions, more distant pulsars can facilitate the CGW search with PTA data sets. Bayesian parameter estimation is yielding better parameter constraints and the frequentist per-frequentist optimal statistic search becomes more stable.

We further found a statistically significant super-linear correlation ($β= 1.34$ $\\pm$ 0.86) between $L^{\\rm gas}_{0.5-2\\,\\mathrm{keV}}$/SFR and HCN(4-3)/CO(1-0) intensity ratio, whereas no such trend is seen for HCO$^+$(4-3)/CO(1-0) or CO(3-2)/CO(1-0). These findings indicate that AGN feedback does not dominate star formation regulation on sub-kiloparsec scales, and that the excitation of dense gas traced by HCN (4-3) may be more directly influenced by high-energy feedback processes compared to HCO$^+$ (4-3) and CO (3-2)."}

However, current evidence relies on small samples, leaving open whether bars play a significant role during stripping. In this study, we analyse a sample about five times larger than those used in previous works, comprising 176 galaxies identified as RPS candidates based on optical morphological indicators such as asymmetries, debris tails, and displaced star-forming regions. To assess the impact of these processes, we examine radial $u-r$ colour profiles from SDSS imaging as tracers of the specific star formation rate (sSFR). We classify galaxies by bar presence and RPS signatures, and construct comparison samples through stepwise matching in stellar mass and environment to disentangle the individual and combined effects of bars and RPS on stellar population gradients. Our results show that central rejuvenation signals emerge in RPS candidate galaxies, becoming most evident when bars and RPS act together. Barred RPS galaxies are systematically bluer at all radii than their non-RPS counterparts, while unbarred systems display only mild or no central differences, suggesting that the observable outcome of RPS depends on the stripping stage. Furthermore, barred galaxies exhibit flatter central colour profiles than unbarred ones -- a robust signature across all matched configurations. These findings highlight the key role of bars in amplifying environmental effects on the stellar populations of jellyfish galaxies, underscoring how internal structures can modulate the observable signatures of environmental processes in galaxies."}

Potential origins of these variations (e.g., host galaxy contribution, accretion disk variability, and dust reprocessing) are discussed. We conclude that temperature-dependent dust reprocessing dominates the observed BWB, RWB, and no/weak variation patterns. This interpretation may also apply to similar MIR color variations observed in other extragalactic MIR transients, such as tidal disruption events, ambiguous nuclear transients, and changing-look AGNs. In addition, we find no significant difference in long-term MIR color variations between RL-NLSy1s and RQ-NLSy1s, however, RL-NLSy1s show significantly greater dispersion in intrinsic variability amplitude compared to RQ-NLSy1s due to jet-induced complexity, where non-thermal synchrotron emission from relativistic jets obscures thermal dust signatures."}

However, in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, overionization reduces line opacity and quenches the line force, which suppresses outflows. Here, we show that small-scale clumping can resolve this problem. Adopting the microclumping approximation, our new simulations demonstrate that even modest volume filling factors ($f_V \\sim 0.1-0.01$) can dramatically increase the wind mass-loss rate by lowering its ionization state -- raising $\\dot{M}_{\\rm wind}$ and yielding $\\dot{M}_{\\rm wind}/\\dot{M}_{\\rm acc}\\!\\gtrsim\\!10^{-4}$ for such modest filling factors. Clumpy wind models produce the UV resonance lines that are absent from smooth wind models.

Together, these results provide the first robust, self-consistent demonstration that clumping can reconcile line-driven wind theory with observations across AWDs and AGNs."}

We perform comprehensive numerical and analytical calculations of the complete isocurvature spectrum evolution, including gravitational particle production, reheating dynamics, and scalar-induced GW generation.

Comments welcome!", "summary": "We present the first spatially resolved investigation of near-infrared coronal lines in dwarf galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN), using JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy. Coronal lines (CLs), which are forbidden transitions from highly ionized species with ionization potentials up to 450 eV, act as sensitive tracers of the AGN ionizing continuum and feedback processes. Across four dwarf galaxies with ionized gas outflows traced by the optical [O III] lines, we report the detection of 16 unique species of near-infrared CLs. Line ratio diagnostics indicate that photoionization from the AGN dominates the excitation of CLs. We find that the coronal line region in dwarf galaxies, traced by the various CLs, extends up to 0.5 kpc, and can constitute up to 10% of their host galaxy size. Correlations between CL luminosities and [O III] ionized gas outflow properties are consistent with a scenario in which AGN-driven outflows likely facilitate the detection of CLs and contribute to their extent. Several CLs, including [Si VI], [Si VII], and [Mg VIII], exhibit a secondary broad component (W$_{80}$ > 300 km/s). If we interpret this spatially compact gas as part of an outflow, this would indicate that the outflowing gas includes a wide range of ionizations. The estimated energetics imply this highly ionized component is compact yet powerful enough to perturb gas in the central regions of the host dwarfs. These results indicate that AGN in low-mass galaxies may produce outflows capable of influencing their structure and evolution."}

While supernova remnants (SNRs) are observed to produce up to 1 M$_\\odot$ of dust, the amount of dust destroyed by the forward shock (FS) is poorly constrained, raising the question whether they are net dust producers or destroyers. Aims. We aim to estimate the dust destruction efficiency of SNR FSs in a realistically turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) during their most destructive phase, and assess dust shielding by high density filaments during this period. Methods. We run 3D turbulence simulations for different turbulent Mach numbers (0-3) and average ISM densities (1-100 cm$^{-3}$) to resemble observations of the turbulent ISM. We then set off a supernova to trace its 3D magnetohydrodynamical evolution for 10 kyr. Finally, we run post-processing simulations to study the dust transport and destruction by the SNR FS, considering gas and plasma drag, kinetic and thermal sputtering, and grain-grain collisions, and either silicate or carbonaceous dust. Results. The dust destruction rate of the FS strongly depends on the average ISM density and turbulence strength, varying between 27-92% (0.85-11.0 M$_\\odot$) in the studied 10 kyr. Overall, dust is less efficiently destroyed in a low density medium (1 cm$^{-3}$, 27-57%) than in intermediate (10 cm$^{-3}$, 46-92%) and high densities (100 cm$^{-3}$, 73-87%). The FS destroys 8-34% less dust in high Mach turbulence compared to a homogeneous medium. Furthermore, carbonaceous grains are more robust (up to 21% more) than silicates. Conclusions. Filaments can partly shield dust from destruction in the first 10 kyr, however, always more than 0.85 M$_\\odot$ of dust is destroyed, making most SNRs dust sinks under the conditions explored in this work. The destruction efficiency of the SNRs with less than 1 M$_\\odot$ of destroyed dust has not yet plateaued so that they are most likely also net dust destroyers by the end of their lifetime."}

Interestingly, we observe that the fringes across the interferometer output beam are inherently shifted in wavelength even when a constant phase profile is provided to the SLM. We calibrate the spectral shifts as a function of fringe spatial location by measuring the incident light spectrum at various points across the fringe pattern, and observe that the spectral peak traces out a `teardrop' shape, whose width is dependent on the spectral bandwidth of the source, the relative tilt and path difference between the two arms of the interferometer, and the divergence of the beam. Next, we demonstrate that this inherent spectral variation of the fringes can be used to perform fast single-snapshot spectroscopy of narrow-band light sources, while a time-varied phase profile provided to the SLM leads to multi-step spectroscopy with lower noise, higher resolution, and better contrast.

We performed a basic analysis of the morphology and kinematics in the source plane using nonparametric lens modeling of the red and blue bins. We found tentative evidence of a velocity gradient across both sources and no evidence of any clumpy structure, companions, or ongoing mergers. The previously calculated high star formation rates and low depletion times of both SPT0125-47 and SPT2134-50 suggest that these galaxies are undergoing a dramatic phase in their evolution.

The combined use of Gaia DR3 multiband photometry, astrometric parameter RUWE, non-single star solutions along with available ground-based spectroscopic, high angular resolution, and polarimetric observations enable more robust constraints on the binary star population in the cluster. Several conclusions may have broader implications for other stellar populations. Twin binaries, with mass ratio close to $q\\sim 1$, tend to have lower RUWE, increasing their membership selection probability, relative to $q\\sim 0.5$ systems that are disfavored. The frequently observed peak in mass ratio distribution for $q\\sim 1$ binaries may be partially attributed to this bias. Photometrically fitted mass ratio is underestimated for double-lined spectroscopic binaries in agreement with other authors. Differential extinction photometrically mimics stellar binarity. An area of enlarged absorption is traced by increased polarization south of the Merope star and excluded from the analysis to avoid this bias. The fraction of systems with $q>0.6$ companions is measured to be $f=16.4\\%^{+2.6}_{-0.6}$ for $m>0.5~M_\\odot$ stars, which is larger than recent Gaia-based estimates, but compatible with the pre-Gaia values for Pleiades and the field population.

In this work, we compute the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial object along different chaotic and non-chaotic orbits by implementing the numerical kludge scheme. We further perform a spectral analysis of the gravitational waveforms from such orbits. In particular, we show that when the system is in a chaotic state, the gravitational wave signals are characterized by broader frequency spectra with finite widths, enhanced amplitude and energy emission rate, distinctly differentiating them from the signals generated during the system's non-chaotic state. Through recurrence analysis we also show that the time series of gravitational waveforms strain carry unique information on the motion of chaotic dynamics, which can be used to distinctly differentiate from non-chaotic to chaotic motion of the source. Furthermore, we discuss the potential detectability of these orbits for upcoming observatories like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, emphasizing the significant potential for detecting chaotic imprints in gravitational waves to substantially enhance our understanding of chaotic dynamics in black hole physics and the dark matter environments of galactic nuclei."}

The rich imaging data it collects will be an invaluable resource for probing galaxy evolution across cosmic time, characterizing the host galaxies of transient phenomena, and identifying novel populations of anomalous systems. While machine learning models have shown promise for extracting galaxy features from multi-band astronomical imaging, the large dimensionality of the learned latent space presents a challenge for mechanistic interpretability studies. In this work, we present Minuet, a low-dimensional diffusion autoencoder for multi-band galaxy imaging. Minuet is trained to reconstruct 72x72-pixel $grz$ image cutouts of 6M galaxies within $z<1$ from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey using only five latent dimensions. By using a diffusion model conditioned on the transformer-based autoencoder's output for image reconstruction, we achieve semantically-meaningful latent representations of galaxy images while still allowing for high-fidelity, probabilistic reconstructions. We train a series of binary classifiers on Minuet's latent features to quantify their connection to morphological labels from Galaxy Zoo, and a conditional flow to produce posterior distributions of SED-derived redshifts, stellar masses, and star-formation rates. We further show the value of Minuet for nearest neighbor searches in the learned latent space. Minuet provides strong evidence for the low intrinsic dimensionality of galaxy imaging, and introduces a class of astrophysical models that produce highly compact representations for diverse science goals."}

Recent cosmological simulations such as FLAMINGO calibrate their feedback model on the baryon fractions of galaxy groups to tune the efficiency of gas ejection. However, recent observational constraints from optically selected groups and the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect yield lower baryon fractions than previous studies, which indicates that feedback may be more ejective than previously thought. Here we show that models involving highly ejective feedback are inconsistent with the scaling relations of local galaxy groups in the mass range $10^{13}-10^{14}M_\\odot$. We study the X-ray luminosity-temperature relation in a sample of 44 galaxy groups with high-quality XMM-Newton observations. We show that highly ejective models under-predict the luminosity of galaxy groups at fixed mass at high significance ($5.7σ$). This conclusion is robust against selection effects and is obtained from directly measurable and minimally correlated quantities. We point out that turning observable quantities into gas fraction estimates is challenging, especially in the context of stacking large samples of heterogeneous systems. We argue that calibrating feedback models on baryon fractions is prone to systematic uncertainties and that observable scaling relations are better suited for this task."}

In all three PNe, the electron temperatures derived using the collisionally excited lines (CELs) are higher than those yielded by the HI Balmer and Paschen jumps, while the temperatures yielded by the OII and NII optical recombination lines (ORLs) are very low, <2000 K, indicating that the heavy-element ORLs probe cold nebular regions. The ORL abundances of N, O and Ne are systematically higher than the corresponding CEL values, confirming high ADFs in the three objects. Position-velocity (PV) diagrams were created, and spatio-kinematical studies show that CELs come from the outer nebular regions, while the ORL-emitting regions are close to nebular center.

However, this method cannot be applied to embedded protostars in binary or multiple systems, where their components are usually unresolved over this extended wavelength range. We propose a new method, based on the idea that a molecule formed (mainly) on the grain surfaces only emits lines in the region where it thermally sublimates from the grain mantles, heated by the photons emitted by the embedded source. In this respect, carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is an optimal molecule, because of its low binding energy and rotational lines in the millimetre.

The properties of these velocity distributions govern the ISOs' propagation and dynamical evolution in the Galactic potential. We investigate how planetary system architecture influences ISO production during post-gas-disc dynamical instabilities using N-body simulations. We explore the ISO production outcomes of 2461 randomly generated systems spanning total system masses of 300-800 Earth masses and multiplicities of 3-7 planets. By integrating planets embedded in a disc of test particles for 10 Myr, we find that evolving systems can be broadly divided into two distinct classes based on their initial architectures. Catastrophic systems are characterized by high multiplicities and orbitally compact configurations, or by high-mass planets in systems with large mass asymmetries. These systems eject a large fraction of their planetesimals (median 59 percent) and, depending on the ejection pathway, produce high-speed ISOs (median 2.9 km/s). In contrast, quiet systems have lower masses and multiplicities and do not undergo significant orbital rearrangement, yet still eject a median of 28 percent of planetesimals at lower velocities (median 1.6 km/s). This dichotomy points to distinct ejection pathways, involving either violent global instabilities or more gradual, diffusive processes. Overall, we find that ISO ejection velocities are typically low, on the order of a few km/s. Although ISOs subsequently experience dynamical heating as they orbit the Galaxy, their velocity distributions retain signatures of their progenitor systems' architectures and histories, underscoring the potential use of ISOs in Galactic archaeology."}

A number of breaks have been found in the nuclear spectrum, which was previously thought to be a pure power law up to the knee. Data from air shower arrays also show interesting features in the arrival directions of cosmic-ray nuclei. On the theoretical side, more sophisticated models are able to explain the various spectral breaks either with transitions between different classes of sources or with changes in the transport regime.

We map out numerical procedures for finding the positions of these extrema across all possible cases. Finally we derive the positional offset and deviance associated with observing a fixed pair of blended sources from a variety of orientations, showing that this can be a significant source of excess noise."}

The leading order shape distortion is shear, which, if measurable, will be a complementary cosmological probe to traditional cosmic shear. In Hogg et al. (2025a), we modelled 23 of the SLACS strong lenses, studying the line-of-sight (LOS) shear under a variety of shear and mass model parametrisations. In this work, we model 27 additional lenses, extending our sample of LOS shear constraints to 45 in total. We find a mean shear magnitude of $0.11\\pm 0.024$, showing that a significant fraction of the lenses modelled in this work possess LOS shears with unexpectedly large magnitudes, $|γ_{\\rm LOS}| > 0.1$, even when an octupolar distortion is included in the lens mass. We further investigate if factors such as lens and source redshift, filter and PSF, or flux and signal-to-noise ratio in the lensed arcs correlate with shear. We find that none of these features play a statistically significant role in the production of unusually large shear magnitudes."}

While spectroscopy provides precise measurements, it is observationally expensive, and photometry discards morphological information that correlates with mass, star formation history, metallicity, and dust. We present a conditional flow matching (CFM) framework that leverages pixel-level imaging alongside photometry to improve posterior inference of galaxy properties. Using $\\sim10^5$ SDSS galaxies, we compare models trained on photometry alone versus photometry plus images. The image+photometry model outperforms the photometry-only model in posterior inference and more reliably recovers known scaling relations. Morphological information also helps mitigate the dust--age degeneracy. Our results highlight the potential of integrating morphology into photometric SED fitting pipelines, opening a pathway towards more accurate and physically informed constraints on galaxy properties."}
