Implications for high and low redshift massive black holes", "categories": ["astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "Submitted to A&A. 9 Figures", "summary": "Recent studies show that light seeds of black holes, which grow into massive\nblack holes (MBHs) over time, often struggle to remain at the centers of their\nbirthplaces in high-redshift galaxies, limiting their ability to accrete gas\nand merge with other black holes. In this work, we investigate how off-center\nformation of the first seeds affects the evolution of the MBH and massive black\nhole binary (MBHB) populations over cosmic history. To this end, we use the\n$\\texttt{L-Galaxies}{\\it BH}$ semi-analytical model, which includes multiple\nseed formation mechanisms, with light Population III remnants being the most\nsignificant contributors. To incorporate off-center formation, we modify the\nmodel to track the initial seed location, the sinking timescales toward the\ngalactic center, and any growth during this phase. The results indicate that\nseed formation occurring away from the galactic center has a negligible impact\non the MBH population at $z<1$, but causes significant differences at higher\nredshifts. Particularly, the abundance of $10^5 M_{\\odot}$ MBHs at $z>4$ can be\nup to 2-10 times smaller compared to a nuclear seed formation model. Quasar\nluminosity functions with $\\rm L_{bol}>10^{44} \\rm erg/s$ are similarly\naffected, although they still align with observational constraints. The\noff-centre formation also alters the galaxy-MBH mass relation. At $z>5$, the\namplitude of the relation can be up to 2 dex smaller than in nuclear seed\nmodels. These differences fade by $z \\sim 2$ for galaxies $>10^{11} M_{\\odot}$,\nand by $z=0$ for smaller galaxies. Notably, the overmassive MBH population\nrecently unveiled by JWST is still present in the model, suggesting they can\nform independently of the seed dynamics. Finally, the merging rate of MBHs\nwithin LISA sensitivity band is strongly impacted. Specifically, there is a\nsuppression of events at high-$z$ and an enhancement at low-$z$."}

Collisional ring galaxies provide a\nunique opportunity, as their morphology allows precise dating of the\ninteraction, which can then be compared to quenching timescales inferred from\nstar formation histories. We study a gravitationally bound system at $z=1.61$\nin the UDS field, composed of a Host galaxy ($M_\\star = 10^{11.4} M_\\odot$)\nwith a collisional ring and an X-ray AGN, and the Bullet galaxy ($M_\\star =\n10^{11.2} M_\\odot$), located at a projected distance of $\\sim 8$ kpc. Combining\nJWST and HST imaging with Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy, we find compelling\nevidence for an ongoing starburst in the Host concurrent with rapid quenching\nin the Bullet. The ring, $\\sim 20$ kpc in diameter, is expanding at\n$127^{+72}_{-29}$ km s$^{-1}$, implying the galaxies first collided 47--96 Myr\nago. This timeline is consistent with the Host's current starburst and the\nBullet's sudden quenching, strongly suggesting both phenomena were triggered by\nthe interaction. Crucially, the Bullet shows no evidence of a preceding\nstarburst, ruling out rapid gas consumption as the primary quenching channel.\nInstead, we suggest that merger-driven processes -- such as enhanced turbulence\nand disk instabilities -- may have suppressed star formation. An additional\npossibility, which we term the ``Dragon Effect,'' is that AGN-driven outflows\nfrom the Host disrupted the Bullet's low-density molecular gas, thereby\npreventing efficient star formation and accelerating quenching."}

Using baryon acoustic oscillations\n(BAO), supernovae (SN), big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), and local $H_0$ data,\nwhile explicitly avoiding CMB anisotropies, we examine how this calibration\nshift propagates into constraints on the dark energy equation of state. We find\nthat lowering $r_d$ systematically drives the $w_0$-$w_a$ posterior toward less\ndynamical, quintessence-like behavior, bringing it closer to $\\Lambda$CDM.

In order\nto estimate the contributions of faint/low-mass sources we implement a method\nin which the faint-end of the IR LF is inferred by stacking (in stellar mass\nand redshift bins) the optical/near-infrared samples of star-forming galaxies\ninto the appropriate FIR Herschel and sub-mm JCMT maps. Using this information\nwe determine the faint-end slope of the FIR LF in two intermediate redshift\nbins (where it can be robustly established) and then adopt this result at all\nother redshifts. The evolution of the characteristic luminosity of the galaxy\nFIR LF, L*, is found to be increase monotonically with redshift, evolving as\nz^1.38+-0.07, while the characteristic number density is well fitted by double\npower-law function, constant at z<2.24 and declining as z^-4.95+-0.73 at higher\nredshifts.

In this work, we examine how prior choices affect\nsuch conclusions. Specifically, we study the biases introduced by the customary\nuse of uniform priors on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameters, $w_0$\nand $w_a$, when assessing evidence for evolving dark energy. To do so, we\nconstruct theory-informed priors on $(w_0, w_a)$ using a normalizing flow (NF),\ntrained on two representative quintessence models, which learns the\ndistribution of these parameters conditional on the underlying $\\Lambda$CDM\nparameters. In the combined $\\textit{Planck}$ CMB + DESI BAO analysis we find\nthat the apparent tension with a cosmological constant in the CPL framework can\nbe reduced from $\\sim 3.1\\sigma$ to $\\sim 1.3\\sigma$ once theory-informed\npriors are applied, rendering the result effectively consistent with\n$\\Lambda$CDM. For completeness, we also analyze combinations that include Type\nIa supernova data, showing similar shifts toward the $\\Lambda$CDM limit. Taken\ntogether, the observed sensitivity to prior choices in these analyses arises\nbecause uniform priors - often mischaracterized as \"uninformative\" - can\nactually bias inferences toward unphysical parameter regions. Consequently, our\nresults underscore the importance of adopting physically motivated priors to\nensure robust cosmological inferences, especially when evaluating new\nhypotheses with only marginal statistical support. Lastly, our NF-based\nframework achieves these results by post-processing existing MCMC chains,\nrequiring $\\approx 1$ hour of additional CPU compute time on top of the base\nanalysis - a dramatic speedup over direct model sampling that highlights the\nscalability of this approach for testing diverse theoretical models."}

The final MER catalogues achieve\ncompletenesses of 91 % for SBe in [21, 24], and 54 % for SBe in [24, 28].

By using the final MER mosaics and\nreinjecting this local background, we obtain an image in which we recover\nreliable photometric properties for objects under the arcminute scale.

Small\nasteroid 2023 CX1 was detected in space and predicted to impact over Normandy,\nFrance, on 13 February 2023.

In this paper, we highlight\nseveral often-overlooked properties of these models by analyzing their\ncosmological perturbations. We show that a non-minimal coupling to gravity is\nessential for the stability of the setup. However, avoiding propagation of a\nghost mode then requires imposing a relation between the coupling coefficients,\nknown as the degeneracy condition, which reduces the bumblebee model to a\nsubset of generalized Proca theories with a marginal non-minimal operator. By\nimposing the degeneracy condition, the vector field becomes non-dynamical at\nthe background level, and the form of its potential is completely fixed in\nvacuum. We show that the vacuum expectation value of the vector field can drive\na de Sitter solution, for which the effects of the non-minimal coupling are\nnegligible at the background level but provide essential order-one corrections\nto the sound speed of the scalar mode, keeping the setup weakly coupled at the\nlevel of perturbations. Treating this stealth de Sitter solution as a dark\nenergy candidate, we study its coupling to matter and find the effective\ngravitational coupling for the matter density contrast in the quasi-static\nregime.

Rubin Observatory LSST is expected to discover tens of millions\nof new Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The survey's exceptional cadence and\nsensitivity will enable UV/optical/NIR monitoring of a significant fraction of\nthese objects. The unprecedented number of sources makes spectroscopic\nfollow-up for the vast majority of them unfeasible in the near future, so most\nstudies will have to rely on photometric redshifts estimates which are\ntraditionally much less reliable for AGN than for inactive galaxies. This work\npresents a novel methodology to constrain the photometric redshift of AGNs that\nleverages the effects of cosmological time dilation, and of the luminosity and\nwavelength dependence of AGN variability. Specifically, we assume that the\nvariability can be modeled as a damped random walk (DRW) process, and adopt a\nparametric model to characterize the DRW timescale ($\\tau$) and asymptotic\namplitude of the variability (SF$_\\infty$) based on the redshift, the\nrest-frame wavelength, and the AGN luminosity. We construct variability-based\nphoto-$z$ priors by modeling the observed variability using the expected DRW\nparameters at a given redshift. These variability-based photometric redshift\n(VAR-PZ) priors are then combined with traditional SED fitting to improve the\nredshift estimates from SED fitting.\n  Validation is performed using observational data from the SDSS, demonstrating\nsignificant reduction in catastrophic outliers by more than 10% in comparison\nwith SED fitting techniques and improvements in redshift precision. The\nsimulated light curves with both SDSS and LSST-like cadences and baselines\nconfirm that, VAR-PZ will be able to constrain the photometric redshifts of\nSDSS-like AGNs by bringing the outlier fractions down to below 7% from 32%\n(SED-alone) at the end of the survey."}

The Deimos surface is\ndark and predominantly backscattering, with a single-scattering albedo (SSA)\nvalue (6.8%-7.5%) comparable to Phobos. The Deimos phase curve shows a strong\nopposition effect due to shadow-hiding, with negligible coherent\nbackscattering. The amplitude and the half-width of the shadow-hiding\nopposition surge were found to be 2.14 +/- 0.14 and 0.065 +/- 0.004,\nrespectively. We found a high porosity of 86% at the top-layer surface,\nconsistent with complex-shaped grains or fractal aggregates, suggesting a thick\ndust layer. We did not observe significant variations of the opposition surge\nacross the surface. A blue unit on Deimos, located on streamers of the\nequatorial ridge, shows reflectance increases up to 58%, and a spectral slope\ndecrease of 50% in comparison with the average surface. This blue unit may be\ndue to a different texture of the surface between the two units, with finer\ngrain and/or higher porosity. Deimos photometric properties, including SSA,\nopposition surge, and phase integral, are very similar to Phobos. The presence\nof a blue unit on Deimos reinforces the idea that the Martian moons have a\ncommon origin, making the capture of two different bodies with such similar\nproperties unlikely."}

Heating from the secondary star inflates the outer\ndisk, increasing the aspect ratio facing the companion by about 25% in inclined\ncases compared to 10% in coplanar ones. Dust settling in the mid-plane enhances\nextinction along the disk plane, making the coplanar case cooler than the\ninclined one on the side of the disk facing the companion.

During\noutbursts, the aspect ratio doubles on the star-facing side and increases by\n50% on the opposite side in inclined cases.

We\ninvestigate whether gravitational-wave observations with the Laser\nInterferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could provide an independent probe of the\nmillisecond pulsar binary population in the Galactic bulge.\n  We construct synthetic populations of millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binaries\nunder two illustrative formation scenarios: an accreted scenario, in which\nsystems are deposited by disrupted globular clusters, and an in situ scenario,\nin which binaries form through isolated binary evolution. In both cases, only\n$10^{-5}$--$10^{-4}$ of the underlying bulge population is detectable by LISA.\nNevertheless, even a few detections would imply tens to hundreds of thousands\nof unseen systems. Accreted binaries are expected to have lower chirp masses\n($\\sim$0.4 M$_\\odot$), while in situ binaries produce more massive companions\n($\\sim$0.9 M$_\\odot$).\n  LISA will measure binary frequencies with high precision, but chirp masses\ncan only be determined for the most massive or highest-frequency systems.\nDistinguishing millisecond pulsar binaries from the far more numerous double\nwhite dwarfs will be challenging, though LISA detections could provide valuable\ntargets for follow-up with the Square Kilometre Array, enabling a critical test\nof the millisecond pulsar origin of the $\\gamma$-ray excess."}

The unprecedented number of sources makes spectroscopic\nfollow-up for the vast majority of them unfeasible in the near future, so most\nstudies will have to rely on photometric redshifts estimates which are\ntraditionally much less reliable for AGN than for inactive galaxies. This work\npresents a novel methodology to constrain the photometric redshift of AGNs that\nleverages the effects of cosmological time dilation, and of the luminosity and\nwavelength dependence of AGN variability. Specifically, we assume that the\nvariability can be modeled as a damped random walk (DRW) process, and adopt a\nparametric model to characterize the DRW timescale ($\\tau$) and asymptotic\namplitude of the variability (SF$_\\infty$) based on the redshift, the\nrest-frame wavelength, and the AGN luminosity. We construct variability-based\nphoto-$z$ priors by modeling the observed variability using the expected DRW\nparameters at a given redshift. These variability-based photometric redshift\n(VAR-PZ) priors are then combined with traditional SED fitting to improve the\nredshift estimates from SED fitting.\n  Validation is performed using observational data from the SDSS, demonstrating\nsignificant reduction in catastrophic outliers by more than 10% in comparison\nwith SED fitting techniques and improvements in redshift precision.

We derive analytical expressions for the\ntransition rate; they reveal the influence of key parameters and their\nuncertainties. We update constraints using historical gamma-ray data from\nSN~1987A and find $g_{a\\gamma}<5\\times10^{-12}~{\\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for\n$m_a\\lesssim10^{-9}$ meV. We also forecast sensitivities for a future Galactic\nSN and for NSMs, assuming observations with Fermi-LAT or similar gamma-ray\ninstruments. We distinguish ALPs -- defined as coupling only to photons and\nproduced via Primakoff scattering -- from axions, which also couple to nucleons\nand emerge through nuclear bremsstrahlung. We omit pionic axion production due\nto its large uncertainties and inconsistencies, though it could contribute\ncomparably to bremsstrahlung under optimistic assumptions. For the compact\nsources, we adopt time-averaged one-zone models, guided by numerical\nsimulations, to enable clear and reproducible parametric studies."}
