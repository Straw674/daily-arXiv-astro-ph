We fit the major axis kinematics using forward\nmodelling of a rotating disk, and then subtract the two-dimensional beam\nconvolved best-fit model revealing signatures of planar non-circular motions in\nthe residuals. The inferred in-plane radial velocities are remarkably large, of\nthe order of $\\approx60$ km/s. Direct comparisons with a high-resolution,\nsimulated, gas-rich, barred galaxy, obtained with the moving mesh code AREPO\nand the TNG sub-grid model, show that the observed non-circular gas flows can\nbe explained as radial flows driven by the central bar, with an inferred net\ninflow rate of the order of the SFR.

Nested, stratified jet structures\nconsisting of an inner ionized core seen in [Fe II] with an outer H2 layer are\ncommonly seen. Wide-angle winds are found in low-J H2 lines. [S I] follows the\njet in the youngest protostars, but is concentrated on source when more\nevolved. [Ne II] reveals a mix of jet shock and photoionized emission. H I\nlines measure accretion, but are also associated with jets. Molecular emission\n(CO2, C2H2, HCN, H2O, ..) is cool compared with disks, and likely associated\nwith hot cores. Deep ice absorption features reveal not just the major ice\ncomponents but also ions (as part of salts) and complex organic molecules, with\ncomparable abundances from low- to high-mass sources. A second detection of HDO\nice in a solar-mass source is presented with HDO/H2O ~ 0.4%, providing a link\nwith disks and comets.

Open clusters (OCs) are important for understanding star formation,\ndynamics, and evolution. Previous studies have indicated a relationship between\ncluster structure and member star properties, but the formation mechanism of\nthe layered structure of OCs remains unclear. Aims. We study the\nthree-dimensional spatial distribution of 279 nearby OCs to understand the\nformation mechanism of the layered structure. Methods. We analyzed the spatial\ndistribution of member stars within each OC and correlated the presence of a\nlayered structure with the number of member stars. Additionally, we performd\nN-body simulations to model the evolution of OCSN 125. We assessd the\ncorrelation between the binary fraction, the most massive star, and the radius\nof the layered structure in each simulated OC. Results. Our analysis reveals\nthat OCs with fewer member stars tend to lack a layered structure. The results\nfrom N-body simulations indicate that the presence of a layered structure is\nstrongly influenced by dynamical factors, particularly the most massive star\nand the binary fraction. Massive stars drive mass loss through supernova\nexplosions and stellar winds, which weaken the spatial layering. Furthermore,\nclusters with higher binary fractions exhibit a weaker layered structure,\nlikely due to energy equipartition, dynamical friction, and perturbations\ncaused by binary systems. These factors contribute to delaying core collapse\nand slowing the emergence of a layered structure. Conclusions. Our findings\nsuggest that dynamical interactions, including the effects of the most massive\nstars and binary fraction, play a critical role in the formation and disruption\nof the layered structure in OCs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790279\u4e2a\u90bb\u8fd1\u5f00\u653e\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u548cN\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u6700\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u548c\u53cc\u661f\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff09\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "background": "\u5f00\u653e\u661f\u56e2\uff08OCs\uff09\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u6052\u661f\u5f62\u6210\u3001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "data": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86279\u4e2a\u90bb\u8fd1\u5f00\u653e\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u661f\u56e2\u6210\u5458\u6052\u661f\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7N\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\uff08\u5982OCSN 125\uff09\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6210\u5458\u6052\u661f\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u661f\u56e2\u5f80\u5f80\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u5982\u6700\u5927\u8d28\u91cf\u6052\u661f\u548c\u53cc\u661f\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff09\u5bf9\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u7834\u574f\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

In this\npaper, we introduce the Polarisation Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism\n(POSSUM), a groundbreaking survey with three primary objectives: (1) to create\na comprehensive Faraday rotation measure (RM) grid of up to one million compact\nextragalactic sources across the southern ~50 per cent of the sky (20,630\ndeg$^2$); (2) to map the intrinsic polarisation and RM properties of a wide\nrange of discrete extragalactic and Galactic objects over the same area; and\n(3) to contribute interferometric data with excellent surface brightness\nsensitivity, which can be combined with single-dish data to study the diffuse\nGalactic interstellar medium. Observations for the full POSSUM survey commenced\nin May 2023 and are expected to conclude by mid-2028. POSSUM will achieve an RM\ngrid density of around 30-50 RMs per square degree with a median measurement\nuncertainty of ~1 rad m$^{-2}$. The survey operates primarily over a frequency\nrange of 800-1088 MHz, with an angular resolution of 20'' and a typical RMS\nsensitivity in Stokes $Q$ or $U$ of 18 $\\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. Additionally, the\nsurvey will be supplemented by similar observations covering 1296-1440 MHz over\n38 per cent of the sky. POSSUM will enable the discovery and detailed\ninvestigation of magnetised phenomena in a wide range of cosmic environments,\nas well as the interplay between these components. This paper reviews the\ncurrent science case developed by the POSSUM Collaboration and provides an\noverview of POSSUM's observations, data processing, outputs, and its\ncomplementarity with other radio and multi-wavelength surveys, including future\nwork with the SKA.

Article accepted\n  for publication A&A", "summary": "Globular clusters (GCs) are key to understanding the formation and evolution\nof our Galaxy. While the abundances of light and Fe-peak elements in GCs have\nbeen widely studied, investigations into heavier, neutron-capture elements --\nand their connection to multiple stellar populations and GC origins -- remain\nlimited. In this work, we analysed the chemical abundances of neutron-capture\nelements in GCs to trace the Galactic halo and to explore possible links to the\nMP phenomenon. Our goal is to better constrain the nature of the polluters\nresponsible for intracluster enrichment and to distinguish the origin of GCs\nthrough the chemical signature of neutron-capture elements. We examined 14 GCs\nfrom the Gaia-ESO Survey, spanning a wide metallicity range, [Fe/H] from -0.40\nto -2.32, using a homogeneous methodology. We focused on the abundances of Y,\nZr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, Pr, and Eu, derived from FLAMES-UVES spectra. These were\ncompared with predictions from a stochastic Galactic chemical evolution model.\nWith the exception of Zr, the model broadly reproduces the observed trends in\nneutron-capture elements. In some GCs, we found strong correlations between hot\nH-burning products (Na, Al) and s-process elements, pointing to a shared\nnucleosynthesis site, e.g., asymptotic giant branch stars of different masses\nand/or fast-rotating massive stars. We also detect a distinct difference in\n[Eu/Mg] ratio between in-situ ($\\langle$[Eu/Mg]$\\rangle$ = 0.14 dex) and\nex-situ ($\\langle$[Eu/Mg]$\\langle$ = 0.32 dex) GCs, highlighting their\ndifferent enrichment histories. Finally, on average, Type II GCs (NGC 362, NGC\n1261, and NGC 1851) showed a s-process element spread ratio between second- and\nfirst-generations about twice as large as those seen in Type I clusters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u4e2d\u4e2d\u5b50\u4fd8\u83b7\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u6655\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u591a\u91cd\u6052\u661f\u79cd\u7fa4\u73b0\u8c61\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6765\u6e90\u661f\u56e2\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "background": "\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u94f6\u6cb3\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5b50\u4fd8\u83b7\u5143\u7d20\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u591a\u91cd\u6052\u661f\u79cd\u7fa4\u548c\u661f\u56e2\u8d77\u6e90\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\u3002", "data": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6765\u81eaGaia-ESO Survey\u768414\u4e2a\u7403\u72b6\u661f\u56e2\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u4e86-0.40\u5230-2.32\u7684\u91d1\u5c5e\u4e30\u5ea6\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86FLAMES-UVES\u5149\u8c31\u4e2dY\u3001Zr\u3001Ba\u3001La\u3001Ce\u3001Nd\u3001Pr\u548cEu\u7684\u4e30\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e2d\u5b50\u4fd8\u83b7\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u5316\u5b66\u4e30\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u94f6\u6cb3\u5316\u5b66\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u9664Zr\u5916\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5927\u81f4\u91cd\u73b0\u4e2d\u5b50\u4fd8\u83b7\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1b\u90e8\u5206\u661f\u56e2\u4e2d\u70ed\u6c22\u71c3\u70e7\u4ea7\u7269\u4e0es-\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u5171\u4eab\u6838\u5408\u6210\u573a\u6240\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u539f\u4f4d\u548c\u975e\u539f\u4f4d\u661f\u56e2\u7684[Eu/Mg]\u6bd4\u503c\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14II\u578b\u661f\u56e2\u7684s-\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5143\u7d20\u6269\u6563\u6bd4I\u578b\u661f\u56e2\u66f4\u5927\u3002"}}

Molecular\nline ratios can serve as probes to better understand the chemistry and physics\nin these regions. Aims. We use interpretable machine learning to study 9\ndifferent molecular ratios, helping us understand the forward connection\nbetween the physics of these environments and the carbon and oxygen\nchemistries. Methods. Using a large grid of astrochemical models generated\nusing UCLCHEM, we study the properties of molecular clouds of low oxygen and\ncarbon initial abundance. We first try to understand the line ratios using a\nclassical analysis. We then move on to using interpretable machine learning,\nnamely Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to understand the higher order\ndependencies of the ratios over the entire parameter grid. Lastly we use the\nUniform Manifold Approximation and Projection technique (UMAP) as a reduction\nmethod to create intuitive groupings of models. Results. We find that the\nparameter space is well covered by the line ratios, allowing us to investigate\nall input parameters. SHAP analysis shows that the temperature and density are\nthe most important features, but the carbon and oxygen abundances are important\nin parts of the parameter space. Lastly, we find that we can group different\ntypes of ratios using UMAP. Conclusions. We show the chosen ratios are mostly\nsensitive to changes in the carbon initial abundance, together with the\ntemperature and density. Especially the CN/HCN and HNC/HCN ratio are shown to\nbe sensitive to the initial carbon abundance, making them excellent probes for\nthis parameter. Out of the ratios, only CS/SO shows a sensitivity to the oxygen\nabundance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "background": "Error", "data": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error"}}

Following the encounter, binaries may disrupt into\nan ejected star and a captured one, they may merge, or survive to either fly\naway or come back for one or more subsequent encounters, until they are either\ndisrupted or fly away. In this paper, we analyse how a binary's fate depends on\nits orbital parameters, by following its evolution through up to three\nsubsequent pericentre passages. We choose an initial population of circular\nbinaries on parabolic orbits. We present results from our restricted three-body\nformalism, whose strength lies in the ability to easily explore a\nmultidimensional parameter space and make predictions independent of the binary\nphysical properties. We find that fates depend strongly on orbital inclination,\nhow deep the encounter is into the MBH tidal sphere and on the binary\neccentricity, developed during encounters. Generally, non retrograde\ntrajectories, high eccentricities or deep encounters produce disruptions\npreferentially. Disruption is the most common fate.

The fraction of 1P stars in clusters,\n$F_{1P}$, is a decreasing function of the cluster present-day mass, $m_{prst}$.\nThe information about cluster formation it contains has yet to be unlocked.\nPaper I demonstrated that the observed distribution $(m_{prst},F_{1P})$ of\nGalactic globular clusters can result from a pristine-star fraction that is\ninversely proportional to their birth mass, $m_{ecl}$. This relation was then\ncalibrated with a fixed stellar mass threshold for 2P-star formation, $m_{th}$,\ni.e., $F_{1P}=m_{th}/m_{ecl}$. We now estimate the masses $m_{init}$ of\nGalactic globular clusters as they start their long-term gas-free evolution in\nthe Galaxy and we map their behavior in the $(m_{init},F_{1P})$ space. Several\ndissolution time-scales are tested (with and without primordial mass\nsegregation), each yielding its own initial cluster distribution\n$(m_{init},F_{1P})$. The $(m_{init},F_{1P})$ distributions are mapped according\nto cluster origin, with the emphasis on the Disk, Low-Energy and Gaia-Enceladus\ncluster groups of Massari et al. (2019). All three initial distributions\n$(m_{init},F_{1P})$ are more compact than their present-day counterparts since\ndynamical evolution scatters clusters in the $F_{1P}$ versus cluster-mass\nspace. The Disk initial distribution is the tightest one and potential reasons\nfor this are discussed. Its power-law representation allows us to generalize\nthe initial mass threshold of Paper I and prompts us to represent the cluster\n$({\\rm mass},F_{1P})$ distribution in a log-log space.

Additional high-resolution spectroscopic data were obtained with MUSE at\nthe VLT. Our research is based on strong lensing analyses that rely on these\nmeasurements. From these data, we measure the projected total mass profiles of\neach galaxy cluster in our sample. We fit these mass profiles with\none-component, spherically symmetric mass models including the\nNavarro-Frenk-White (NFW), non-singular isothermal sphere, beta model, and\nHernquist profiles. We perform a Bayesian analysis to sample the posterior\nprobability distributions of the free parameters of the models. We find that\nthe NFW, Hernquist, and beta models are the most suitable profiles to fit the\nmeasured projected cluster total mass profiles. Moreover, we test the\nrobustness of our results in a twofold way: we slightly modify the center of\nthe projected mass profiles and the radial range of the considered region. We\nemploy the results obtained with the Hernquist profile to compare our total\nmass estimates ($M_\\mathrm{H}^\\mathrm{tot} = M_\\mathrm{H} (r\\rightarrow +\n\\infty)$), with the $M_\\mathrm{200c}$ values from weak lensing studies.

At low metallicity, they might\ncollapse directly into black holes, or end their lives as pair-instability\nsupernovae. Recent observational results set an upper limit of $0.7\\,{}\\mathrm{\nyr}^{-1} \\,{}\\mathrm{ Gpc}^{-3}$ on the rate density of pair-instability\nsupernovae in the nearby Universe. However, most theoretical models predict\nrates exceeding this limit.

We find that the main contribution to the\npair-instability supernova rate comes from stars with metallicity\n$Z\\sim{}0.001-0.002$. Stars with higher metallicities cannot enter the\npair-instability supernova regime, even if their zero-age main sequence mass is\nup to 500 M$_\\odot$. The main reason is that VMSs enter the regime for\noptically thick winds during the main sequence at metallicity as low as\n$Z\\sim{4}\\times{}10^{-4}$. This enhances the mass loss rate, quenching the\ngrowth of the He core and thus preventing the onset of pair-instability in\nlater evolutionary stages.

This is in order to constrain the endpoint of\nthe galactochemical evolution of phosphorus in the course of stellar\nnucleosynthesis over cosmic time and to provide an abundance baseline for the\nstudy of the depletion of phosphorus onto dust grains in the interstellar\nmedium. A model atom for P II/III/IV based on a comprehensive new set of ab\ninitio data for line transitions, photoionisations and electron-impact\nexcitation was developed.
