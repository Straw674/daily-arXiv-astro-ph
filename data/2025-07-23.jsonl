Traditional approaches, such as parametric\nlight-profile fitting, offer valuable insights but become computationally\nprohibitive when applied to billions of sources. In this work, we propose a\nConditional AutoEncoder (CAE) framework to simultaneously model and\ncharacterize galaxy morphology. Our CAE is trained on a suite of realistic mock\ngalaxy images generated via GalSim, encompassing a broad range of galaxy types,\nphotometric parameters (e.g., flux, half-light radius, Sersic index,\nellipticity), and observational conditions. By encoding each galaxy image into\na low-dimensional latent representation conditioned on key parameters, our\nmodel effectively recovers these morphological features in a disentangled\nmanner, while also reconstructing the original image. The results demonstrate\nthat the CAE approach can accurately and efficiently infer complex structural\nproperties, offering a powerful alternative to existing methods."}

We employed a widely used method to quantify the MSTO\nwidth in terms of age spread. Additionally, to validate our approach, we used a\ncluster also observed with HST. Our analysis confirms that the eMSTO phenomenon\nis also present in low-mass clusters, following the known age/mass-MSTO width\nrelations.

Recently, Madore & Freedman (2025, hereafter MF25) recalibrated Gaia\nEDR3 parallaxes by adding to them a magnitude offset to match certain historic\nCepheid parallaxes which otherwise differ by $\\sim1.6\\sigma$. A calibration\nwhich adjusts Gaia parallaxes by applying a magnitude offset (i.e., a\nmultiplicative correction in parallax) differs significantly from the Gaia\nTeam's calibration (Lindegren et al. 2021), which is additive in parallax space\n- especially at distances much closer than 1 kpc or beyond 10 kpc, outside the\n$\\sim$2-3 kpc range on which the MF25 calibration was based.

Although recent studies with fast radio bursts (FRBs)\nhave largely addressed this discrepancy, the precise spatial distribution of\nthese baryons remains uncertain due to the effect of galaxy feedback.\nCosmological hydrodynamical simulations such as Simba have shown that the\npartitioning of baryons between the intergalactic medium (IGM) and haloes is\nsensitive to feedback models, motivating the connection of baryon distribution\nwith feedback physics. With the Simba simulation suite, this study investigates\nhow feedback affects the distribution of matter within large-scale cosmic\nstructures, with implications for FRB foreground modeling. We apply the T-web\nmethod to classify the cosmic web into different structures: knots, filaments,\nsheets, and voids.

Our results show that\nin Simba, the fractions of IGM gas in different cosmic web structures vary only\na few percent under different feedback models.

We investigate a wide range of abundance ratios, finding\nthat the Splash differs from the high-alpha disc overall. However, these\ndifferences result from a smooth variation of chemical compositions as a\nfunction of orbital properties. The Splash occupies the high-alpha,\nhigh-[Al,K/Fe], and low-[Mn/Fe] end of the high-alpha disk population. In\nagreement with previous studies, we find that Splash stars are distributed over\nlarge heights from the Galactic mid-plane. To further elucidate the relation\nbetween the Splash and the high-alpha disk, we turn to simulations. Using a\nsample of Milky Way-like galaxies with and without major accretion events from\nthe ARTEMIS simulations, we find that Splash-like populations are ubiquitous,\nthough not always resulting from major mergers. Lower mass progenitors can also\ngenerate Splash-like features, as long as they are on retrograde orbits.\nMoreover, we find a strong correlation between the mass fraction of Splash\nstars and the fraction of retrograde accreted stars in the disk. Some galaxies\nwith minor (retrograde) mergers contain more pronounced Splash populations than\nothers with major, but prograde, mergers. For stars in the high-alpha disks, we\nalso find a decrease in the [alpha/Fe] with increasing orbital angular\nmomentum. This trend is found in hosts with both major or minor mergers. Our\nresults suggest that a number of relatively low-mass mergers on retrograde\norbits could result in populations that are qualitatively similar to the\nSplash."}

Virgo-like clusters accelerate reionization in their surroundings\nout to ~5-10 cMpc, beyond which local overdensity again becomes the dominant\nfactor.

The VISCACHA survey aims to fully explain the chemical\nevolution of SMC star clusters by analyzing different sub-regions adopted from\nan existing framework. The west halo (WH) region, which contains the oldest and\nmost metal-poor stellar populations, exhibits a clear age-metallicity relation\n(AMR) with minimal dispersion. This region shows a significant dip of ~0.5 dex\nin metallicity approximately 6 Gyr ago. This was likely caused by a major\nmerger event that subsequently accelerated the star formation rate. Clusters in\nthe Southern Bridge (SB) and Northern Bridge regions of the SMC may have\nexperienced distinct chemical enrichment histories, as suggested by our\nprevious works but with limited data coverage. Furthermore, the AMR of\nwing/bridge (W/B) shows no sign of enrichment caused by the aforementioned\nmerger event, but exhibits signatures of the recent collisions between the\nclouds contemporaneous with the epochs of the Magellanic Stream and Bridge\nformations.\n  In this study, we present an updated AMR for the SB region based on a sample\nthat includes approximately 67% of its known clusters. Contrary to the\nexpectation of a very unique chemical evolution history, these SB clusters show\na trend similar to the one of the WH clusters. The chemical evolution models\nthat best fit the AMR trend of the SB clusters show excellent agreement with\nthe major merger model proposed for the WH clusters. Building on this, we\nsuggest a new unified chemical evolution model for both the WH and SB clusters,\nwhich can be explained by a major merger at ~6 Gyr followed by episodic\nchemical enrichment over time."}

In this scenario, a\nfirst generation of BHs resulting from collapsing stars form in a dense\nenvironment. Here they can assemble dynamically and undergo subsequent mergers.\nWe discuss three challenges for the formation of a GW231123-like event inside a\nstar cluster: 1) The high masses of the incoming BHs appear to be in the\npredicted pair-instability mass gap and thus suggest that second-generation or\nhigher-order generation BHs are involved. 2) Very high spins ($\\chi_f \\gtrsim\n0.8$) are very unlikely for dynamically assembled BHs because of the isotropic\ndistribution of spin vectors. 3) Hierarchically formed BHs are susceptible to\nreceive large recoils, which could kick them out of their cluster. We simulate\nthis scenario and show that only a few percent of mergers recover remnants\nwithin GW231123's primary spin estimate $\\chi_1=0.9^{+0.10}_{-0.19}$ and are\nretained inside typical star clusters. A large fraction of very rapidly\nspinning second-generation BHs (including $\\chi_f>0.9$) can only form if the\nfirst-generation BHs merges with aligned spins. This is a natural outcome of\nmassive binary star evolution scenarios, such as a chemically homogeneous\nevolution. This scenario also predicts equal masses for the components,\nimplying that the resulting BHs tend to receive very low recoil kicks and would\ntherefore likely be retained inside a cluster. We conclude that GW231123-like\nevents, if formed in a star cluster, could require first-generation BHs with\nlarge aligned spins that evolved through stellar binary interaction, followed\nby the dynamical assembly for a subsequent merger.
