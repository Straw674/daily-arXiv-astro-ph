### [1] [Magnetic fields in the intracluster medium with TNG-Cluster: properties, morphology, and tangential anisotropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12517)
*Katrin Lehle,Mateusz Ruszkowski,Dylan Nelson,Marine Prunier,Annalisa Pillepich*

**TL;DR**: 研究发现冷核星系团中心区域（约0.1倍r500c尺度）存在优先切向排列的磁场结构，这种特征由内部重力波在强熵梯度环境中的捕获机制驱动，区别于非冷核团各向同性的磁场构型。

Result: z=0冷核星系团在约0.1 r500c特征尺度上优先呈现切向磁场形态。

Abstract: We characterize the magnetic field properties of 352 massive galaxy clusters
from the TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamical cosmological simulation with a focus
on central magnetic field morphology in cool-core (CC) vs non-cool-core (NCC)
clusters. We present the central values and radial profiles of magnetic field
strength and plasma parameter as a function of mass, cooling status and
redshift. Compared to low-redshift observations, TNG-Cluster produces
reasonable magnetic field amplitudes in the central regions of clusters
spanning a range of 1-200 muG. We then discuss the main finding of this work:
z=0 cool-core clusters have preferentially tangential magnetic fields at a
characteristic scale of ~ 0.1 r500c. These strongly tangential field
orientations are specific to CCs. In contrast, across the full cluster
population, magnetic fields show isotropic configurations at all radii and
redshifts. As individual halos grow, the evolution of their magnetic field
topologies is diverse: tangential features can be short-lived, persist over
large cosmological time-scales, or periodically appear, vanish, and reappear
towards z=0. We discuss the underlying physics and possible physical scenarios
to explain the origin of these structures. We argue that both AGN
feedback-driven outflows, and merger-driven sloshing motions, cannot explain
the population-wide tangential bias in magnetic field orientation. Instead, we
propose that the trapping of internal gravity waves is responsible for the
tangentially biased magnetic field topologies that we find in cool-core
TNG-Cluster halos, due to the strong entropy gradient in these clusters.

### [2] [The effect of the environment-dependent stellar initial mass function on the baryonic Tully Fisher relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12521)

**TL;DR**: 研究发现星系范围恒星初始质量函数（gwIMF）的环境依赖性对重子塔尔-费舍尔关系（BTFR）有显著影响，尤其通过集成星系范围初始质量函数（IGIMF）理论解释了高质量星系观测速度高于预期的偏差，揭示了恒星种群特性对重子质量-速度关系的关键作用。

Abstract: We investigate the impact of an environment-dependent galaxy-wide stellar
initial mass function (gwIMF) on the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR). The
integrated galaxy-wide IMF (IGIMF) theory, which incorporates variations in
stellar populations due to star formation history (SFH) and metallicity,
provides a more accurate framework for understanding systematic deviations in
galaxy scaling relations than that given by an invariant gwIMF. By considering
how the mass-to-light ratio of the stellar population is influenced by
metallicity and SFH, we show that high-mass galaxies have their masses in stars
and remnants underestimated under the assumption of a constant mass-to-light
ratio. In contrast, low-mass, gas-dominated galaxies are less affected. Our
results suggest that the discrepancies between the true and observed BTFR are
primarily driven by the evolving nature of the stellar IMF, particularly in
galaxies with slowly declining SFHs. The IGIMF theory offers a solution to the
observed offsets in the BTFR, especially for high-mass galaxies, where the
rotational velocities are higher than predicted by MOND. We conclude that
incorporating the IGIMF provides a more accurate description of galaxy
dynamics, revealing the importance of stellar population characteristics in
refining our understanding of the baryonic mass-velocity relationship. This
study underscores the necessity of accounting for the variation of the gwIMF
when interpreting the BTFR, particularly in the context of alternative
gravitational theories like MOND.

Method: 采用三维辐射磁流体动力学模拟研究磁场对原球状星团中第二代恒星形成的影响。

Abstract: We investigate the previously unexplored role of magnetic fields in the
formation of second-generation (SG) stars in proto-globular clusters (GCs)
using 3D radiation-magnetohydrodynamical simulations. This study is based on
the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) scenario and incorporates photoionization
feedback and stellar winds from AGB stars. We model SG formation within a young
($34$ Myr) massive ($10^6 $ Msun) proto-GC moving through a magnetized,
homogeneous interstellar medium. Our results indicate that variations in
magnetic field strength and orientation significantly influence the gas
geometry and SG star-forming regions around the cluster. Overall, magnetic
fields limit SG formation to the very center of the cluster, with stronger
magnetic fields tending to form more compact SG clusters. For magnetic field
strengths of $0.5$ and $5$ microG, we observe no substantial changes in the
mass of formed SG stars. However, with a strong $50$ microG field, we see a
$25$ percent increase or a $70$ percent decrease in total SG mass, for a field
aligned parallel or perpendicular to the cluster's motion, respectively. This
variation reflects how magnetic fields influence gas accretion, as our results
suggest that gas accreted from the interstellar medium (ISM) slightly dominates
over AGB ejecta in the cluster, except in cases of strong perpendicular fields,
where gas accretion is efficiently suppressed. Additionally, stronger magnetic
fields limit the cluster's ability to retain its ejecta, leading to the
formation of stars with lower helium abundances. On the other hand, a strong
perpendicular magnetic field produces SG stars that originate from AGB ejecta
and exhibit the highest helium abundances.

**TL;DR**: 通过N体模拟发现猎户座星云团初始质量约1200-2000 M⊙、半质量半径0.2-0.3 pc且高度质量分层，其演化路径可解释昴星团和毕星团的形成。

Abstract: Using direct $N$-body simulations, we investigate the initial conditions and
evolution of a star-forming region resembling the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC)
with the advanced \textsc{NBODY6} code. By varying the initial conditions, we
aim to identify a model that closely aligns with observed parameters such as
the half-mass radius, core radius, and total mass. Additionally, we examine the
cluster's evolution over 800 Myr to determine whether it could reproduce the
present-day properties of the Pleiades and Hyades along its evolutionary path.
Under the influence of a Milky Way-like tidal field, the ONC experiences
significant mass loss, primarily due to rapid gas expulsion, retaining
approximately 47\% of its initial 4200 stars by about 100 Myr and only 9\% by
about 700 Myr. These evolutionary stages closely match the properties of the
Pleiades and Hyades, suggesting that an ONC-like cluster may have been their
precursor. Additional models with varying degrees of primordial mass
segregation indicate that the ONC likely had an initial half-mass radius of
0.2-0.3 pc, a total mass of 1200 - 2000 M$_\odot$, and a high degree of mass
segregation. Models with an initial stellar count of about $N_{\text{in}}
\approx 4 \times 10^3 - 5 \times 10^3$, rich in binaries and exhibiting mass
segregation, show excellent agreement with observed cluster properties.

Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) emit radiation via accretion across the entire
energy spectrum. While the standard disk and corona model can somewhat describe
this emission, it fails to predict specific features such as the soft X-ray
excess, the short-term optical/UV variability, and the observed UV/X-ray
correlation in AGN. In this context, the fraction of AGN emission in different
bands (i.e., bolometric corrections) can be useful to better understand the
accretion physics of AGN. Past studies have shown that the X-ray bolometric
corrections are strongly dependent on the physical properties of AGN, such as
their luminosities and Eddington ratios. However, since these two parameters
depend on each other, it has been unclear which is the main driver of the X-ray
bolometric corrections. We present here results from a large study of hard
X-ray-selected (14-195 keV) nearby ($z<0.1$) AGN. Based on our systematic
analysis of the simultaneous optical-to-X-ray spectral energy distributions of
236 unobscured AGN, we found that the primary parameter controlling the X-ray
bolometric corrections is the Eddington ratio. Our results show that while the
X-ray bolometric correction increases with the bolometric luminosity for
sources with intermediate Eddington ratios ($0.01-1$), this dependence vanishes
for sources with lower Eddington ratios ($<0.01$). This could be used as
evidence for a change in the accretion physics of AGN at low Eddington ratios.

### [6] [The halo magnetic field of a spiral galaxy at z=0.414](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12542)

Abstract: Even though magnetic fields play an important role in galaxy evolution, the
redshift evolution of galactic-scale magnetic fields is not well constrained
observationally. In this paper we aim to provide an observational constraint on
the time-scale of the mean-field dynamo, and derive the magnetic field in a
distant galaxy at $z=0.414$. We obtained broadband spectro-polarimetric $1-8$
GHz Very Large Array observation of the lensing system B1600+434, which is a
background quasar gravitationally lensed by a foreground spiral galaxy into two
images. We apply Rotation Measure (RM) synthesis and Stokes $QU$ fitting to
derive the RM of the two lensed images, which we use to estimate the lensing
galaxy's magnetic field. We measured the RM difference between the lensed
images, and detected Faraday dispersion caused by the magneto-ionic medium of
the lensing galaxy at $z=0.414$. Assuming that the RM difference is due to the
large-scale regular field of the galaxy's halo, we measure a coherent magnetic
field with a strength of $0.2 - 3.0\,\mu$G at 0.7 kpc, and $0.01 - 2.8 \,\mu$G
at 6.2 kpc vertical distance from the disk of the galaxy. We derive an upper
limit on the dynamo e-folding time: $\tau_{\rm dynamo} < 2.9~\times 10^8$~yr.
We find turbulence on scales below 50 pc, and a turbulent field strength of
$0.2 - 12.1 \, \mu$G. We measure the magnetic field in the halo of a spiral
galaxy, and find turbulence on scales of $<50$ pc. If the RM difference is due
to large-scale fields, our result follows the expectation from mean-field
dynamo theory, and shows that galaxies at $z \simeq 0.4$ already have magnetic
field strengths similar to present-day galaxies. However, we note the caveat of
the possibility of the turbulent field of the lensing galaxy contributing to
the observed RM difference.

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of enigmatic,
compact sources at high redshift known as ''Little Red Dots'' (LRDs), whose
physical nature remains a subject of intense debate. Concurrently, the rapid
assembly of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) requires the formation
of heavy seeds, for which supermassive stars (SMSs) are leading theoretical
progenitors. In this work, we perform the first quantitative test of the
hypothesis that LRDs are the direct observational manifestation of these
primordial SMSs. We present a novel, first-principles pipeline generating
synthetic spectra for a non-rotating, metal-free $10^6 \, M_\odot$ SMS. We
establish that its luminosity ($L_\lambda \approx 1.7 \times 10^{44} \,
\text{erg} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \mu\text{m}^{-1}$ at 4050 Angstroms) provides a
decisive constraint, matching prominent LRDs. Our model self-consistently
reproduces their defining spectral features: the extreme, V-shaped Balmer break
is an intrinsic photospheric effect, while the complex line phenomenology,
strong H$\beta$ in emission with other Balmer lines in absorption arises from
non-LTE effects in a single stellar atmosphere. Applying physically motivated
broadening, our spectrum provides an excellent quantitative match to LRDs at
both high ($z=7.76$) and low ($z=3.55$) redshift. Our model provides a simple,
self-consistent physical picture for LRDs, offering a compelling alternative to
multi-component obscured AGN scenarios and suggesting we may be directly
witnessing the final, luminous moments of an SMBH progenitor before its
ultimate collapse.

Result: 棒状结构驱动的非圆周运动导致终端速度法在银河系内部高估了圆周速度和中心质量浓度。

Abstract: The circular speed curve of the Milky Way provides a key constraint on its
mass distribution, reflecting the axisymmetric component of the gravitational
potential. This is especially critical in the inner Galaxy ($R \lesssim 4$
kpc), where non-axisymmetric structures such as the stellar bar and nuclear
stellar disk strongly influence dynamics. However, significant discrepancies
remain between circular speed curves inferred from stellar dynamical modeling
and those derived from the terminal-velocity method applied to gas kinematics.
To investigate this, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations
including cooling, heating, star formation, and feedback, under a realistic
gravitational potential derived from stellar dynamical models calibrated to
observational data. This potential includes the Galactic bar, stellar disks,
dark matter halo, nuclear stellar disk, and nuclear star cluster. We generate
synthetic longitude-velocity ($l$-$v$) diagrams and apply the terminal-velocity
method to derive circular speeds. The simulated gas reproduces the observed
terminal-velocity envelope, including a steep inner rise. We find this feature
arises from bar-driven non-circular motions, which cause the terminal-velocity
method to overestimate circular speeds by up to a factor of 2 at $R \sim 0.4$
kpc, and enclosed mass by up to a factor of 4. These results suggest that inner
gas-based rotation curves can significantly overestimate central mass
concentrations. The steep inner rise in gas-derived circular speeds does not
require a massive classical bulge but can be explained by bar-induced streaming
motions. Rather than proposing a new mechanism, our study provides a clear,
Milky Way-specific demonstration of this effect, emphasizing the importance of
dynamical modeling that explicitly includes non-circular motions for accurate
mass inference in the inner Milky Way.

Result: 双峰窄发射线中红移和蓝移成分的流量比之间存在强线性相关性，表明多数双峰窄发射线系统与预期的双星系系统无关。

Abstract: Dual galaxy system (DGS) is one of the widely accepted scenarios to explain
the double-peaked narrow emission lines (DPNELs) due to orbital motions of the
two galaxies in a merging system. After considering no physical connections
between two independent narrow emission line regions in two galaxies in one
DGS, there should be no correlations between flux ratios $R_{R}$ of red-shifted
narrow emission components from one galaxy and flux ratios $R_{B}$ of
blue-shifted narrow emission components from the other galaxy in the DGS.
However, after checking the large sample of DPNELs in the SDSS, there are
strong linear correlations in different groups between $R_{R}$ as the flux
ratio of red-shifted narrow [O~{\sc iii}] to the red-shifted narrow H$\alpha$
and $R_{B}$ as the flux ratio of blue-shifted narrow [O~{\sc iii}] to the
blue-shifted narrow H$\alpha$. Meanwhile, after checking narrow emission line
properties of galaxy pairs within 30 (20, 10) arcmins, there are no connections
between narrow emission line fluxes in the galaxy pairs, to support the
detected linear correlations being robust enough between $R_{R}$ and $R_{B}$ in
the DPNELs in SDSS. Furthermore, through oversimplified simulations, at least
more than 60% of the DPNELs should be not related to the expected DGSs.

Abstract: In the final paper of this series, we discuss new perspectives and challenges
in the study of interstellar medium (ISM), leveraging comprehensive catalogs
and physical insights presented in our previous papers. We focus on key
questions of far-infrared (FIR) fine-structure lines (FSLs): their origins,
diagnostic value, and implications of correlations. Our analysis reveals a
strong dependence on elemental abundance, so that FSL/H$\alpha$ traces
metallicity, [N II]/[C II] traces N/O, and $\sim$80% of [C II] emission arises
from neutral gas without systematic variations. We conclude a coherence exists
between the emissions from ionized and neutral gases regarding energy sources
and distribution. We argue that [C II] is physically a metallicity-dependent
star formation rate (SFR) tracer, while its correlations with atomic or
molecular gas masses are secondary. Crucially, the [C II] ``deficit'' is only
part of a universal ``deficit'' problem that shows in all neutral and ionized
gas lines including extinction-corrected H$\alpha$, caused by infrared (IR)
luminosities and characterized by a dichotomy in gas and dust behaviors. This
universal ``deficit'' marks a breakdown of the obscuration-corrected
star-formation rate (SFR) calibration and imperils SFR estimates. We argue that
it is caused by either IR ``excess'' or ionized gas ``deficit'', and present
possible scenarios. A renewed picture of ISM structure is needed to reconcile
with ionized--neutral gas coherence, metallicity dependence, and gas--dust
dichotomy. We also discuss differences of FIR FSL at high redshifts: the offset
in ``deficit'' trends, the similar [O III]/[C II] in metal-poor galaxies, and
elevated [O III]/[C II] in dusty galaxies.

Abstract: Turbulence plays a critical role in regulating star formation in molecular
clouds and is also observed in simulations of primordial halos that host
Population III (Pop III) stars. The relative velocity between baryons and dark
matter at the time of recombination is thought to be a source of turbulence in
the early universe. In this paper, we study how this stream velocity affects
the turbulence inside primordial halos using high-resolution cosmological
simulations across the redshift range of $z = 30$ to $z = 20$. We find that at
a fixed redshift, the stream velocity enhances turbulence in low-mass halos ($M
\lesssim 10^6 \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$) and suppresses it for high-mass halos ($M
\gtrsim 10^6 \ \mathrm{M_\odot}$). The enhancement in low-mass halos likely
arises from residual kinetic energy introduced by the stream velocity, while
the suppression in high-mass halos likely arises from a reduction in inflowing
accretion-driven turbulence. This mass-dependent modulation of turbulence
suggests that the initial conditions inside primordial halos are altered in the
presence of the stream velocity, potentially influencing their fragmentation
and the resulting star formation.

Abstract: JWST highlighted an excess of UV-bright galaxies at z>10, with a derived UVLF
that exhibits a softer evolution than expected. In this work, we aim at
characterizing the burstiness level of high-redshift galaxy SFHs and its
evolution. We implement a stochastic SFH module in CIGALE using power spectrum
densities, to estimate the burstiness level of star formation in galaxies at
6<z<12. We find that SFHs with a high level of stochasticity better reproduce
the SEDs of z>6 galaxies, while smoother assumptions introduce biases when
applied to galaxies with bursty star-formation activity. The assumed
stochasticity level of the SFH also affects the constraints on galaxies'
physical properties, including the main sequence. Successively assuming
different levels of burstiness, we determined the best-suited SFH for each
6<z<12 galaxy in the JADES sample from a Bayes Factor analysis. Galaxies are
classified according to their level of burstiness, and the corresponding
physical properties are associated to them. For massive galaxies (log
Mstar/Msun> 8.8), the fraction of bursty galaxies increases from 0.42+/-0.08 to
0.76+/-0.20 from z=6 to 12, respectively. At all redshifts, only <20% of
low-mass galaxies are classified as bursty, due to their faintness resulting in
low S/N. For bursty galaxies, the log10(SFR10/SFR100) ratio, another indicator
of bursty star formation, does not evolve with redshift, but the fraction of
galaxies with high log10(SFR10/SFR100) slightly increases from 0.25+/-0.06 to
0.37+/-0.11 between z=6 and z=9. We include additional constraints from
observations on sigmaUV and SFE, finding a maximum of 0.72+/-0.02 mag and
0.06+/-0.01, for sigmaUV and SFE, respectively. This confirms that neither
alone is responsible for the weak evolution of the UVLF at z>10. Our results
add further evidence that a combination with other mechanisms is likely
responsible for the high-z UVLF.

### [13] [Probing the nature of gravity in the low-acceleration limit: wide binaries of extreme separations with perspective effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13177)
*Youngsub Yoon,Yong Tian,Kyu-Hyun Chae*

**TL;DR**: 通过分析宽双星系统发现，在低牛顿加速度（约10^-11至10^-10 m/s²）下观测到的引力加速度比牛顿理论预测值高1.3至1.6倍，与MOND型修正引力理论预测一致。

Background: 研究背景为在低加速度条件下观测宽双星系统中引力加速度增强现象，挑战牛顿引力理论并支持MOND型修正引力理论。

Data: 使用严格筛选条件的宽双星系统数据，并考虑了投影效应的影响。

Method: 采用统计分析方法结合MOND型修正引力模型，并严格考虑视角效应和轨道偏心率变化的影响。

Result: 在低加速度（约10^-11.0 m/s²）下，观测到的引力加速度增强因子γ_g为1.61^{+0.37}_{-0.29}，与MOND型修正引力的预测一致。

Abstract: Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have revealed a boost in
gravitational acceleration with respect to the prediction by Newtonian gravity
at low internal accelerations $\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m\,s$^{-2}$. This phenomenon
is important because it does not permit the dark matter interpretation, unlike
galaxy rotation curves. We extend previous analyses by increasing the maximum
sky-projected separation from 30 to 50 kilo astronomical units (kau). We show
that the so-called ``perspective effects'' are not negligible at this extended
separation and, thus, incorporate it in our analysis. With wide binaries
selected with very stringent criteria, we find that the gravitational
acceleration boost factor, $\gamma_g \equiv g_{\rm obs}/g_{\mathrm N}$, is
$1.61^{+0.37}_{-0.29}$ (from $\delta_{\rm obs-newt}\equiv
(\log_{10}\gamma_g)/\sqrt{2}=0.147\pm0.062$) at Newtonian accelerations
$g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-11.0}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, corresponding to separations of tens
of kau for solar-mass binaries. At Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} =
10^{-10.3}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, we find $\gamma_g=1.26^{+0.12}_{-0.10}$ ($\delta_{\rm
obs-newt}=0.072\pm0.027$). For all binaries with $g_{\rm N}\lesssim10^{-10}$
m\,$s^{-2}$ from our sample, we find $\gamma_g=1.32^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$
($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.085\pm0.027$). These results are consistent with the
generic prediction of MOND-type modified gravity, although the current data are
not sufficient to pin down the low-acceleration limiting behavior. Finally, we
emphasize that the observed deviation from Newtonian gravity cannot be
explained by the perspective effects or any separation-dependent eccentricity
variation which we take into account.

Abstract: We explore the physical environment of the Galactic mid-infrared (MIR) bubble
[HKS2019] E71 (hereafter E71) through a multi-wavelength approach. E71 is
located at the edge of a filamentary structure, as traced in Herschel images
(250-500 $\mu$m), Herschel column density map, and molecular maps in the
velocity range [-20,-14] km/s. It hosts a stellar cluster (radius~1.26 pc,
distance~1.81+/-0.15 kpc) associated with radio continuum emission, including a
centrally positioned B1.5-type massive star (hereafter 'm2'), along with an
enhanced population of evolved low-mass stars and young stellar objects. MIR
images and molecular line maps reveal a PDR surrounding 'm2', exhibiting an
arc-like structure along the edges of E71. Regularly spaced molecular and dust
condensations are identified along this structure. The position-velocity map of
12CO emission suggests an expansion of molecular gas concentrated at the
periphery of E71. Near-infrared spectroscopic observations with TANSPEC confirm
the presence of the accretion process in a massive young stellar object (MYSO)
located near the edge of the bubble. High-resolution uGMRT radio continuum maps
uncover substructures in the ionized emission, both toward the MYSO and the
center of E71. These findings support that 'm2' has shaped an arc-like
morphology through its feedback processes. The pressure exerted by 'm2' and the
velocity structure of the 12/13CO(1-0) emission suggest that the stellar
feedback has likely driven out molecular material, leading to the formation of
the expanding E71 bubble. Our overall investigation infers that the "collect
and collapse" process might be a possible mechanism that can describe the
ongoing star formation activities around the E71 bubble.

Background: 研究软X射线漫射背景（SDXB）的前景与背景成分分离及其起源。

Data: 使用Suzaku卫星对六个视线方向的阴影观测数据。

Method: 采用Suzaku卫星的阴影观测技术分析软X射线背景辐射。

Result: 发现银河系环星系介质中存在氮富集等离子体和超太阳氖丰度，并确认0.5 keV和0.8-1.0 keV的过剩发射均非本地起源。

Abstract: Shadow observations provide a powerful tool to separate foreground components
of the soft diffuse X-ray background (SDXB) from the background components.
Such observations have now established that the ``local'' foreground is made of
the solar wind charge exchange and the local bubble, and the background
emission is from the extended circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way and
from the unresolved extragalactic sources. New data and careful analyses of the
SDXB led to two new discoveries in recent years: (1) excess emission near 0.5
keV that is identified as the NVII emission line, and (2) excess emission near
0.8-1.0 keV that is identified with an additional, super-virial temperature hot
thermal component of the CGM. The goal of this paper is to use Suzaku shadow
observations along six sightlines to determine whether either of these
components is from the ``local'' sources. We eliminate the ambiguity regarding
the origin of NVII emission, ruling out the local origin. We confirm that the
Milky Way CGM contains nitrogen-rich plasma, with a super-solar average (N/O)
of 2.6+-0.5, and suggest that nitrogen-enhanced plasma is widespread throughout
the CGM. We find super-solar Ne abundance in two sighlines, also from the CGM.
Similarly, we rule out the local origin of the hot thermal component and
confirm that it is present beyond the shadowing clouds. Furthermore, we provide
a revised model of the soft diffuse X-ray background, which is crucial for
extragalactic astronomy.

**TL;DR**: 通过解析超弥散星系F8D1的恒星形成历史，发现其经历了约20亿年前的大规模星暴和5亿年前的小规模星暴，证实该星系原为类似NGC 6822的恒星形成星系，现正通过潮汐作用向类似人马座矮星系的系统演化。

Background: 探索超弥散星系（UDGs）的演化机制及其多样性成因。

Data: 使用哈勃太空望远镜（HST）对M81卫星星系F8D1进行深度成像观测，包括中心区域约1千秒差距和沿主轴约6千秒差距的平行场，以及沿主轴和次轴的八个较浅视场。

Result: 发现F8D1的恒星形成历史显示其约20亿年前经历了一次显著爆发和5亿年前一次较小爆发，且其演化路径与NGC 6822类似，可通过潮汐作用和爆发性反馈实现向类似人马座系统的转变。

Abstract: We present deep HST imaging of one of the nearest ultra-diffuse galaxies
(UDGs) outside of the Local Group: F8D1, a satellite of M81 known to be tidally
disrupting. UDGs are an enigmatic and diverse population, with evolutionary
pathways ranging from tidal processing to bursty feedback and high initial
angular momentum. To determine F8D1's evolutionary drivers, we resolve stars in
F8D1's central $\sim$1 kpc and in a parallel field $\sim$6 kpc along its major
axis to deep photometric limits, reaching below the Red Clump. We also image
eight shallower fields along F8D1's major and minor axes. We calculate the star
formation history (SFH) in the two deep fields, finding that while currently
quiescent, both regions experienced a substantial burst $\sim$2 Gyr ago and a
smaller burst $\sim$500 Myr ago, which likely formed F8D1's nuclear star
cluster. In the shallow fields, using the ratio of evolved Asymptotic Giant
Branch and Red Giant Branch stars out to $\sim$13 kpc along F8D1's known
stellar stream, we confirm that F8D1 was globally star-forming until at least 2
Gyr ago. We estimate a total progenitor stellar mass, including the stream, of
$\sim$1.3$\times$10$^8\ M_{\odot}$, with an average [M/H] $\sim$ $-$0.8. We
compare F8D1's properties to those of Local Group galaxies with similar initial
stellar mass. We find that F8D1 is consistent with a progenitor star-forming
galaxy similar to NGC 6822, which is in the midst of a transition to a
Sagittarius-like system. Notably, this evolutionary sequence can be
accomplished through tidal processing alone, in galaxies that have experienced
sufficiently bursty feedback to create cored profiles.

Abstract: For many analyses in cosmology it is necessary to reconstruct the likely
distribution of unobserved fields, such as dark matter or baryons, from
observed luminous tracers. The dominant approach in cosmology has been to use
the so-called halo model, which assumes radially symmetric profiles centered
around luminous tracers such as galaxies. More recently, field-level machine
learning methods have been proposed that can learn to estimate the unobserved
field after being trained on simulations. However, it is unclear whether
machine learning methods indeed significantly improve over linear methods or
the halo model. In this paper we make a systematic comparison of different
approaches to reconstruct dark matter and baryons from galaxy data using the
CAMELS simulations. We find the best results using a combined GNN-CNN approach.
We also provide a general analysis and visualization of the relationship of
matter, baryons, halos and galaxies in these simulations to interpret our
results.

Background: 研究背景聚焦于再电离时期21厘米信号模拟的体积限制与观测数据之间的不匹配问题，特别是样本方差对21厘米干涉测量二维功率谱分析的潜在影响。

Data: 使用300 cMpc的21-cm再电离时代模拟数据，通过高斯初始条件的随机采样生成二维功率谱实现。

Result: 开发了一种基于扩散模型的去噪器，可将21厘米二维功率谱样本方差导致的偏差减少一个数量级，显著提升参数推断的准确性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art simulations of reionisation-era 21-cm signal have limited
volumes, generally orders of magnitude smaller than observations. Consequently,
the Fourier modes in common between simulation and observation have limited
overlap, especially in cylindrical (2D) k-space that is natural for 21-cm
interferometry. This makes sample variance (i.e. the deviation of the simulated
sample from the population mean due to finite box size) a potential issue when
interpreting upcoming 21-cm observations. We introduce \texttt{21cmPSDenoiser},
a score-based diffusion model that can be applied to a single, forward-modelled
realisation of the 21-cm 2D power spectrum (PS), predicting the corresponding
\textit{population mean} on-the-fly during Bayesian inference. Individual
samples of 2D Fourier amplitudes of wave modes relevant to current 21-cm
observations can deviate from the mean by over 50\% for 300 cMpc simulations,
even when only considering stochasticity due to sampling of Gaussian initial
conditions. \texttt{21cmPSDenoiser} reduces this deviation by an order of
magnitude, outperforming current state-of-the-art sample variance mitigation
techniques like Fixing \& Pairing by a factor of few at almost no additional
computational cost ($\sim6$s per PS). Unlike emulators, the denoiser is not
tied to a particular model or simulator since its input is a (model-agnostic)
realisation of the 2D 21-cm PS. Indeed, we confirm that it generalises to PS
produced with a different 21-cm simulator than those on which it was trained.
To quantify the improvement in parameter recovery, we simulate a 21-cm PS
detection by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Arrays (HERA) and run different
inference pipelines corresponding to commonly-used approximations. We find that
using \texttt{21cmPSDenoiser} in the inference pipeline outperforms other
approaches, yielding an unbiased posterior that is 50\% narrower.

Abstract: This study introduces an innovative framework aimed at overcoming the ongoing
issue of mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) in time-delay cosmography by incorporating
observations of both gravitationally lensed and unlensed Type Ia supernovae
(SNe Ia). By simultaneously using lensing magnification measurements
$\mu^{\rm{obs}}$ and cosmic distance ratios ($D_s/D_{ds}$), we develop a
Bayesian framework capable of breaking the MSD. Specifically, we reconstruct
the distance-redshift and magnitude-redshift relations from unlensed Type Ia
supernovae using Gaussian process to avoid dependence on specific cosmological
models. Our framework shows substantial efficacy in resolving the MSD by
imposing constraints on the MSD parameter $\lambda$. Furthermore, we extend
this framework to analyze multiple gravitational lensing systems. The results
show strong agreement with the fiducial MSD parameters used in the data
simulation, confirming our method's effectiveness in mitigating the MSD.
Ultimately, this technique enables the derivation of corrected time-delay
distance measurements under the MSD, improving the precision of cosmological
parameters inferred from strong lensing systems.

Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations are expected to serve as a powerful and
independent probe of the expansion history of the universe. By providing direct
and calibration-free measurements of luminosity distances through waveform
analysis, GWs provide a fundamentally different and potentially more robust
approach to measuring cosmic-scale distances compared to traditional
electromagnetic observations, which is known as the standard siren method. In
this review, we present an overview of recent developments in GW standard siren
cosmology, the latest observational results, and prospects for constraining
cosmological parameters using future GW detections. We first introduce standard
sirens based on how redshift information is obtained and outline the Bayesian
framework used in cosmological parameter estimation. We then review the
measurements on the Hubble constant from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network and
present the potential role of future standard siren observations in
cosmological parameter estimations. A central focus of this review is the
unique ability of GW observations to break cosmological parameter degeneracies
inherent in the EM observations. Since the cosmological parameter degeneracy
directions of GW and EM observations are quite different (roughly orthogonal in
some cases), their combination can significantly improve constraints on
cosmological parameters. This complementarity is expected to become one of the
most critical advantages for GW standard siren cosmology. Looking forward, we
highlight the importance of combining GW standard sirens with other emerging
late-universe cosmological probes such as fast radio bursts, 21 cm intensity
mapping, and strong gravitational lensing to forge a precise cosmological probe
for exploring the late universe. Finally, we introduce the challenges and the
role of machine learning in future standard siren analysis.

Abstract: Bouncing cosmology offers a singularity-free alternative to inflation, but
its minimal realization-comprising only four cosmic phases-predicts a simple
power-law stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) with a narrow
observational window. We introduce the next-to-minimal bouncing cosmology
(NMBC), which adds an extra early contraction phase that imprints a broken
power-law feature in the SGWB spectrum, enhancing detectability. Using our
matrix-representation method grounded in an inequality algebra, we derive a
closed-form expression for the NMBC SGWB spectrum. From this analytical result,
we show that all NMBC models satisfying the current \(\Delta N_{\rm eff}\)
bound \(\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2(f)<1.7\times10^{-6}\) automatically avoid the
trans-Planckian problem, \(\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}<0.79\,m_{\rm pl}\). These
findings establish the NMBC as a self-consistent, self-contained framework
capable of generating a potentially detectable SGWB in both astrophysical and
laboratory searches, and demonstrate the broad utility of our
matrix-representation method for future SGWB analyses in multi-phase
cosmologies.

Abstract: Scatterings whose cross sections increase as the cosmic temperature
decreases, known as temperature-enhanced scatterings, can have a significant
impact on the thermal effective potential of scalar fields responsible for
driving cosmological first-order phase transitions. In this work, we
systematically investigate how the inclusion of temperature-dependent
corrections to the effective potential affects key phase transition parameters,
including the nucleation temperature, latent heat release, and inverse duration
parameter. These modifications influence both the strength and duration of the
phase transition, which in turn determine the properties of the resulting
stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Employing semi-analytic
computational methods, we evaluate the GW spectra generated under these
conditions and compare our predictions with the projected sensitivities of
forthcoming detectors such as LISA, DECIGO, and BBO. Our analysis demonstrates
that temperature-enhanced scatterings can substantially strengthen the phase
transition and produce GW signals that lie within the reach of future
observational facilities. This study highlights the importance of
temperature-dependent microphysical processes in shaping early Universe
cosmological signatures.

Abstract: Upcoming Stage-IV surveys will deliver measurements of distribution of matter
with unprecedented precision, demanding highly accurate theoretical models for
cosmological parameter inference. A major source of modeling uncertainty lies
in astrophysical processes associated with galaxy formation and evolution,
which remain poorly understood. Probes such as the thermal and kinematic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects, X-rays, and dispersion measure from fast radio
bursts offer a promising avenue for mapping the distribution and thermal
properties of cosmic baryons. A unified analytical framework capable of jointly
modeling these observables is essential for fully harnessing the complementary
information while mitigating probe-specific systematics. In this work, we
present a detailed assessment of existing analytical models, which differ in
their assumptions and prescriptions for simultaneously describing the
distribution of matter and baryons in the universe. Using the Magneticum
hydrodynamical simulation, we test these models by jointly analyzing the 3D
auto- and cross-power spectra of the matter and baryonic fields that underpin
the above probes. We find that all models can reproduce the power spectra at
sub-percent to few-percent accuracy, depending on the tracer combination and
number of free parameters. Their ability to recover underlying halo properties,
such as the evolution of gas abundance and thermodynamic profiles with halo
mass, varies considerably. Our results suggest that these models require
further refinement and testing for reliable interpretation of multi-wavelength
datasets.

Result: 开发了一种高效压缩光度红移概率分布函数的方法，压缩速度提升约7000倍且保持相近重建精度。

Abstract: ColdPress is a Python module that compresses photometric redshift probability
distribution functions (PDFs) by encoding quantiles of their cumulative
distribution. For a fixed packet size (the default is 80 bytes per PDF),
ColdPress attains a reconstruction accuracy comparable to the sparse-basis
representation method implemented in the pdf_storage module of Carrasco-Kind &
Brunner (2014), yet reduces the computational cost by a factor of ~7000. I
describe the implementation and quantify its compression speed and
reconstruction accuracy in comparison to pdf_storage for real-life PDFs from
two different photometric redshift codes. ColdPress is free software, available
at https://github.com/ahc-photoz/coldpress-project.

Abstract: As the data volume of astronomical imaging surveys rapidly increases,
traditional methods for image anomaly detection, such as visual inspection by
human experts, are becoming impractical. We introduce a machine-learning-based
approach to detect poor-quality exposures in large imaging surveys, with a
focus on the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in regions of low extinction (i.e.,
$E(B-V)<0.04$). Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer
(ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor
(kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of
labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A
clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in
``good'' and ``bad'' categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and
accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being
reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic
exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection. Being highly
efficient and adaptable, our method offers a scalable solution for quality
control in other large imaging surveys.

Abstract: Symbolic regression is the machine learning method for learning functions
from data. After a brief overview of the symbolic regression landscape, I will
describe the two main challenges that traditional algorithms face: they have an
unknown (and likely significant) probability of failing to find any given good
function, and they suffer from ambiguity and poorly-justified assumptions in
their function-selection procedure. To address these I propose an exhaustive
search and model selection by the minimum description length principle, which
allows accuracy and complexity to be directly traded off by measuring each in
units of information. I showcase the resulting publicly available Exhaustive
Symbolic Regression algorithm on three open problems in astrophysics: the
expansion history of the universe, the effective behaviour of gravity in
galaxies and the potential of the inflaton field. In each case the algorithm
identifies many functions superior to the literature standards. This general
purpose methodology should find widespread utility in science and beyond.

**TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于物理建模的联合拟合方法，通过分区建模银河前景和测量误差，成功从月球轨道实验模拟数据中提取了不同幅度的21厘米信号，显著降低了对天线设计的严苛要求。

Result: 提出了一种抗中等波束色散性的方法，成功从模拟数据中提取了不同幅度的21厘米信号，显著放宽了天线的设计和制造要求。

Abstract: The extraction of the sky-averaged 21 cm signal from Cosmic Dawn and the
Epoch of Reionization faces significant challenges. The bright and anisotropic
Galactic foreground, which is 4 - 6 orders of magnitude brighter than the 21 cm
signal, when convolved with the inevitably chromatic beam, introduces
additional spectral structures that can easily mimic the real 21 cm signal. In
this paper, we investigate the signal extraction for a lunar-orbit experiment,
where the antenna moves fast in orbit and data from multiple orbits have to be
used. We propose a physics-motivated and correlated modeling of both the
foreground and the measurement errors. By dividing the sky into multiple
regions according to the spectral index distribution and accounting for the
full covariance of modeling errors, we jointly fit both the foreground and the
21 cm signal using simulated data for the Discovering the Sky at the Longest
wavelength lunar orbit experiment. This method successfully extracts the 21 cm
signals of various amplitudes from the simulated data even for a testing
antenna with a relatively high level of chromaticity. This approach, which is
robust against moderate beam chromaticity, significantly relaxes the stringent
design and manufacturing requirements for the antenna, offering a practical
solution for future 21 cm global signal experiments either on the ground or in
space.

Result: 开发了一种基于经验模型的方法，通过将重采样噪声建模为啁啾函数并拟合原始数据来有效去除JWST NIRSpec积分场光谱数据立方体中的"wiggles"伪影，从而恢复光谱保真度。

Abstract: $\texttt{raccoon}$ is a Python package for removing resampling noise -
commonly referred to as "wiggles'' - from spaxel-level spectra in datacubes
obtained from the JWST Near Infrared Spectrograph's (NIRSpec) integral field
spectroscopy (IFS) mode. These wiggles arise as artifacts during resampling of
the 2D raw data into 3D datacubes, due to the point spread function (PSF) being
undersampled. The standard JWST data reduction pipeline does not correct for
this noise. The wiggle artifacts can significantly degrade the scientific
usability of the data, particularly at the spaxel level, undermining the
exquisite spatial resolution of NIRSpec. $\texttt{raccoon}$ provides an
empirical correction by modeling and removing these artifacts, thereby
restoring the fidelity of the extracted spectra. $\texttt{raccoon}$
forward-models the wiggles as a chirp function impacting one or more template
spectra that are directly fit to the original data across the entire wavelength
range. The best-fit wiggle model is then used to clean the data while
propagating the associated uncertainties.

Result: 提出了一种基于BF型（单极子）质量拓扑性质的机制，通过整数系数质量项在暴胀期间抑制轴子等曲率扰动，并在QCD相变时精确消失。

Abstract: The QCD axion in the pre-inflation scenario faces a stringent isocurvature
constraint, which requires a relatively low Hubble scale during inflation. If
the axion was heavier than the Hubble scale during inflation, its isocurvature
is suppressed and the constraint disappears. We point out a novel mechanism for
achieving this, relying on the topological nature of a BF-type (monodromy) mass
for the axion. Such a mass term has an integer coefficient, so it could
naturally have been very large during inflation and exactly zero by the time of
the QCD phase transition. This integer can be viewed as a quantized flux, which
is discharged in a first-order phase transition that proceeds by the nucleation
of charged branes. This mechanism can be embedded in cosmology in several
different ways, with tunneling during, at the end of, or after inflation. We
provide a detailed case study of the scenario in which the tunneling event
occurs during inflation. We also comment briefly on possible UV completions
within extra-dimensional gauge theories and string theory. Intriguingly, the
phase transition could be accompanied by the emergence of the chiral Standard
Model field content from a non-chiral theory during inflation.

Abstract: Quantum forces are long-range interactions that arise only at the loop level.
In this work, we study the Sommerfeld enhancement of dark matter (DM)
annihilation cross sections caused by quantum forces. One notable feature of
quantum forces is that they are subject to coherent enhancement in the presence
of a background of mediator particles, which occurs in many situations in
cosmology. We show that this effect has important implications for the
Sommerfeld enhancement and DM physics. For the first time, we calculate the
Sommerfeld factor induced by quantum forces for both bosonic and fermionic
mediators, including the background corrections. We observe several novel
features of the Sommerfeld factor that do not exist in the case of the Yukawa
potential, such as temperature-induced resonance peaks for massless mediators,
and having both enhancement and suppression effects in the same model with
different DM masses. As direct applications, we discuss the DM phenomenology
affected by the Sommerfeld enhancement from quantum forces, including thermal
freeze-out, CMB spectral distortion from DM annihilation, and DM indirect
detection. We highlight one particularly interesting effect relevant to
indirect detection caused by the Sommerfeld enhancement in a non-thermal
background of bosonic mediators in the galaxy, in which case the DM mass is
shifted due to the background correction and the effective cross section for DM
annihilation can be either enhanced or suppressed. This may be important for DM
searches in the Milky Way.

Abstract: A new scheme for detecting wave-like dark matter (DM) using Rydberg atoms is
proposed. Recent advances in trapping and manipulating Rydberg atoms make it
possible to use Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays for DM
detection. We present a simple and innovative experimental procedure that
searches for excitations of trapped Rydberg atoms due to DM-induced electric
field. A scan over DM mass is enabled with the use of the Zeeman and
diamagnetic shifts of energy levels under an applied external magnetic field.
Taking dark photon DM as an example, we demonstrate that our proposed
experiment can have high sensitivity enough to probe previously unexplored
regions of the parameter space of dark photon coupling strengths and masses.

Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles can be generated in the early universe
through misalignment production, thermal processes, the decay of topological
defects, etc. In this paper, we show that scalar perturbations in the early
universe could produce a significant amount of these particles primarily
through mass parametric resonance effects. Scalar perturbations induce
temperature fluctuations during the particle mass transition era, e.g. during
the QCD phase transition. These temperature fluctuations modulate the particle
mass, transferring energy into the field through a parametric mass resonance,
which is a nonlinear effect. This process exhibits a substantially unstable
region that could lead to explosive particle production. Notably, this
mechanism does not generate additional isocurvature perturbations.

Result: 提出了一种基于窄参数共振的暴胀期间非热粒子产生新机制，可导致原初曲率功率谱中出现振荡特征及振幅的共振增强。

Abstract: We propose a new mechanism of non-thermal particle production during
inflation based on a narrow parametric resonance, akin to the dynamics of
post-inflationary preheating. The mechanism is based on the production of
scalar particles with a mass that is an oscillating function of the
slowly-rolling inflaton field. This is achieved in a scenario for the
collective spontaneous breaking of a U(1) gauge symmetry that, while originally
proposed in the context of warm inflation, leads to non-equilibrium particle
production sustaining a (sub-dominant) non-thermal radiation bath throughout
inflation. We show that this may leave an observational imprint, namely
oscillatory features in the primordial curvature power spectrum alongside a
(mild) resonant enhancement of its amplitude, as well as secondary
gravitational waves that can be probed with future CMB experiments.

Result: 振荡子在与外部实标量场耦合时仍能保持长寿命，其寿命受耦合强度和振荡子形状的复杂影响，且在强耦合或大振幅下不一定迅速衰变。

Abstract: Oscillons are long-lived, spherically symmetric solitons that can arise in
real scalar field theories with potentials shallower than quadratic ones. They
are considered to form via parametric resonance during the preheating stage
after inflation and have extended lifetimes. However, the estimation of their
lifespan becomes complicated when taking into account the interactions between
the inflaton field and other fields, as naturally expected in realistic
reheating scenarios. In this study, we investigate how the lifetime of a single
oscillon is affected by the coupling to the external real scalar field. By
numerically computing the instability bands of the external field with the
inhomogeneous oscillon profile as background, we show that the resonance
behavior depends intricately on the coupling strength and shape of the
oscillon. We analyze distinct instability mechanisms that dominate across
different regimes of the coupling strength and oscillon shapes. Especially, we
show that the parametric resonance fails to occur when the oscillon size is too
limited to drive enhancement of the external field. Furthermore, our
simulations show that as the oscillon loses energy, the exponential growth of
the external field can terminate before the oscillon reaches its critical
energy for collapse, which indicates that the external field does not
necessarily lead to rapid destruction of oscillons even in the presence of
strong coupling or with large amplitudes. These results suggest that oscillons
can remain long-lived across a wide range of coupling strengths, with potential
implications for their role in cosmological evolution.

Result: 利用地球扁率引起的J2摄动被动调整轨道参数，显著减少了燃料消耗并提高了立方卫星轨道插入精度。

Abstract: The precise insertion of CubeSats into designated orbits is a complex task,
primarily due to the limited propulsion capabilities and constrained fuel
reserves onboard, which severely restrict the scope for large orbital
corrections. This limitation necessitates the development of more efficient
maneuvering techniques to ensure mission success. In this paper, we propose a
maneuvering sequence that exploits the natural J2 perturbation caused by the
Earth's oblateness. By utilizing the secular effects of this perturbation, it
is possible to passively influence key orbital parameters such as the argument
of perigee and the right ascension of the ascending node, thereby reducing the
need for extensive propulsion-based corrections. The approach is designed to
optimize the CubeSat's orbital insertion and minimize the total fuel required
for trajectory adjustments, making it particularly suitable for
fuel-constrained missions. The proposed methodology is validated through
comprehensive numerical simulations that examine different initial orbital
conditions and perturbation environments. Case studies are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the J2-augmented strategy in achieving
accurate orbital insertion, showing a major reduction in fuel consumption
compared to traditional methods. The results underscore the potential of this
approach to extend the operational life and capabilities of CubeSats, offering
a viable solution for future low-Earth orbit missions.

Abstract: Context. Theories of the formation and evolution of small bodies in planetary
systems predict that they may escape into interstellar space at any time. After
having characterized just two such interlopers -1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and
2I/Borisov more questions were raised than answered. Assessing the recently
discovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will only broaden our understanding of
this complex topic.
  Aims. Here, we investigate the spectral, cometary, and rotational properties
of 3I/ATLAS as well as its dynamical context.
  Methods. We identified the spectral type of 3I/ATLAS from the visible
reflectance spectrum and used photometric observations to derive its level of
activity and rotational properties. Observational data were obtained with the
OSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the
Two-meter Twin Telescope. We used N-body simulations and statistical analyses
of Gaia DR3 data to investigate the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its Galactic
background.
  Results. Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a visible spectrum consistent with
that of a D-type asteroid, and has a spectral slope of 14.6%/1000 A in the
5000-9000 A range, which is similar to the one of Oumuamua but redder than that
of 2I/Borisov and most solar system comets. It has a conspicuous coma and its
rotation period is 16.79 h. The heliocentric components of its Galactic
velocity were (U, V, W) = (-51.25, -19.466, 18.94) km/s with a radiant in
Sagittarius. The analysis of a sample of kinematic analogs of 3I/ATLAS
extracted from Gaia DR3 suggests that its parent system is part of the Galactic
thin disk and includes a solar-like star with slightly sub-solar metallicity.

Background: 探讨潮汐瓦解事件（TDE）与星系合并之间的关联及其对宿主星系恒星种群的影响。

Data: 使用ESO VLT的MUSE积分场光谱仪观测了20个潮汐瓦解事件宿主星系的数据。

Method: 利用MUSE积分场光谱仪观测数据，结合Starlight光谱合成代码和BPASS恒星演化模型分析核区恒星质量分布。

Result: 潮汐瓦解事件与星系合并有强关联性，且在红移小于0.045的合并后星系中超过45%表现出延展发射线区。

Abstract: We present an analysis of twenty tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies
observed with the MUSE integral-field spectrograph on ESO VLT. We investigate
the presence of extended emission line regions (EELRs) and study stellar
populations mostly at sub-kpc scale around the host nuclei. EELRs are detected
in 5/20 hosts, including two unreported systems. All EELRs are found at
z<0.045, suggesting a distance bias and faint EELRs may be missed at higher
redshift. EELRs only appear in post-merger systems and all such hosts at
z<0.045 show them. Thus, we conclude that TDEs and galaxy mergers have a strong
relation, and >45% of post-merger hosts in the sample exhibit EELRs.
Furthermore, we constrained the distributions of stellar masses near the
central black holes (BHs), using the spectral synthesis code Starlight and
BPASS stellar evolution models. The youngest nuclear populations have typical
ages of 1 Gyr and stellar masses below 2.5MSun. The populations that can
produce observable TDEs around non-rotating BHs are dominated by subsolar-mass
stars. 3/4 TDEs requiring larger stellar masses exhibit multi-peaked light
curves, possibly implying relation to repeated partial disruptions of high-mass
stars. The found distributions are in tension with the masses of the stars
derived using light curve models. Mass segregation of the disrupted stars can
enhance the rate of TDEs from supersolar-mass stars but our study implies that
low-mass TDEs should still be abundant and even dominate the distribution,
unless there is a mechanism that prohibits low-mass TDEs or their detection.

Background: 研究探讨年轻大质量星团作为银河宇宙射线潜在重要来源的角色及其伽马射线辐射特性。

Data: 使用费米-LAT卫星观测数据对M16区域（鹰状星云）进行GeV波段分析，重点关注与年轻大质量星团NGC 6611相关的分子云。

Result: 在NGC 6611中，粒子在星团风终止激波处的加速效率估计约为1%至4%。

Abstract: Context. Young Massive Star Clusters, long considered as potentially
important sources of galactic cosmic rays, have recently emerged as gamma-ray
emitters up to very high energies. Aims. In order to quantify the contribution
of this source class to the pool of Galactic CRs, we need to estimate the
typical acceleration efficiency of these systems. Methods. We search for
emission in the GeV band, as most of the energy is emitted in this band. We
perform an analysis of Fermi-LAT data collected towards the M16 region, a
star-forming region also known as the Eagle Nebula, which hosts the Young
Massive Star Cluster NGC 6611. We model the acceleration at the stellar wind
termination shock and the propagation through the wind-blown bubble to derive
the energetics of the process and interpret the GeV observations. Results. We
find significant GeV emission in correspondence of a molecular cloud associated
to the Young Massive Star Cluster NGC 6611. We interpret this as hadronic
emission associated to particle accelerated at the cluster wind termination
shock and propagated through the low-density wind-excavated bubble to the
cloud. Our modeling allows us to put firm constraints on the acceleration
efficiency in NGC 6611, assessing it between $\sim$ 1 % and $\sim$ 4 %.

Background: 探索活动星系核区域中高偏振毫米波辐射源的物理起源

Data: 数据来源于ALMA Band 3观测以及早期ALMA观测数据，同时参考了Chandra和ATCA的存档数据。

Method: 利用ALMA Band 3观测数据，通过分析毫米波连续谱偏振特性（偏振度50%±14%）和光谱指数（-1.8±2.5与-1.3±2.5），结合非热同步辐射模型进行物理机制研究。

Result: 在NGC 4945中心区域发现了一个高度偏振（50% ± 14%）的毫米波连续辐射源，其非热同步辐射特性与已知天体物理源均不匹配。

Abstract: We report the discovery of a highly polarized millimeter (mm) continuum
source in the central region of NGC 4945, identified through ALMA Band 3
observations. This starburst Seyfert 2 galaxy contains numerous compact mm
sources, yet only one - located approximately 3.4" (~60 pc) from the galactic
center and unresolved with ~0.1" resolution - exhibits an unusually high
polarization degree of 50% $\pm$ 14%, likely originating from non-thermal
synchrotron radiation. The source is faint, yet clearly detected in two
separate epochs of observation taken 14 days apart, with flux of 0.104 $\pm$
0.018 and 0.125 $\pm$ 0.016 mJy, as well as in earlier ALMA observations,
showing no variability at any timescale. The spectral index remains stable
within large uncertainties, -1.8 $\pm$ 2.5 and -1.3 $\pm$ 2.5. The source,
which we further refer to as Punctum due to its compactness, revealed no clear
counterparts in existing X-ray or radio observations. Assuming association with
the central region of NGC 4945, we estimate upper limits for its luminosity of
~1 $\times$ 10$^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 3-6 keV X-ray band (from archival
Chandra data) and ~5 $\times$ 10$^{35}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 23 GHz (from archival
ATCA data). A comparison of the radio, mm (including polarization), and X-ray
properties with known astrophysical sources emitting synchrotron radiation,
such as accreting neutron stars, supernova remnants, and non-thermal galactic
filaments, revealed no clear match in any of these scenarios. The exact nature
of this highly polarized source remains undetermined.

**TL;DR**: 发现超新星遗迹G118.4+37.0（Calvera遗迹）是一个在稀薄介质中膨胀的中老年遗迹，其X射线弥散辐射符合激波加热等离子体模型，年龄约10-20千年、距离4-5千秒差距，并与孤立Hα丝状结构和伽马射线峰值位置重合，支持伽马射线辐射的强子起源机制。

Result: Calvera's SNR是一个中等年龄的超新星遗迹，在稀薄介质中膨胀并遭遇了较密相物质，可能源自大质量前身星的星风活动残余。

Abstract: The candidate supernova remnant (SNR) G118.4+37.0 (Calvera's SNR), discovered
as a faint radio ring at high Galactic latitude and coincident with extended
Fermi/LAT gamma-ray emission, is likely associated to the X-ray pulsar 1RXS
J141256.0+792204 (Calvera). Previous XMM-Newton data hinted at soft diffuse
X-ray emission inside the ring but lacked sufficient exposure for detailed
characterisation. We obtained new XMM-Newton observations, and produced
count-rate images, equivalent width and median photon energy maps to identify
optimal regions for spectral analysis. We complemented these observations with
a reanalysis of Fermi/LAT gamma-ray data and new Telescopio Nazionale Galileo
observations aimed to search for Halpha emission. The X-ray diffuse emission is
well described by a model of shock-heated plasma with temperature kT \sim 0.15
keV, mildly under-solar N and o abundances and densities ne=0.1-0.7 cm-3.
According to our estimates, Calvera's SNR is 10-20 kya old and lies at a
distance of 4-5 kpc. A distinti "Clump" region shows hared emission equally
well described by a thermal (kT\sim 1.7 keV) or a non thermal model (Gamma \sim
2.7). The brightest X-ray area is close to the gamma-ray peak and to an
isolated Alpha filament. G118.4+37.0 is a middle-aged remnant which expands in
a tenuous medium and encountered a denser phase, likely the relic of the wind
activity of the massive progenitor star. The estimated SNR distance is
consistent within the uncertainties with that estimated for Calvera, confirming
that this peculiar pulsar was born in the explosion of a massive star high
above the Galactic disk. Our measured ambient density, together with the patchy
morphology of the gamma-ray emission and the detection of Halpha filaments
indicates that a hadronic origin is compatible with the gamma-ray flux, though
a mixed leptonic-hadronic cannot be excluded

Abstract: The discovery of the massive black hole (BH) system Gaia BH3 in pre-release
Gaia DR4 data suggests that wide BH binaries with luminous companions may be
significantly overrepresented at low metallicities. Motivated by this finding,
we have initiated a spectroscopic survey of low-metallicity stars exhibiting
elevated RUWE values in Gaia DR3, using the FEROS and APF spectrographs. We
identify promising BH binary candidates as objects with instantaneously
measured radial velocities (RVs) that are very different from their mean RVs
reported in Gaia DR3. Thus far, we have observed over 500 targets, including a
nearly complete sample of stars with $\text{[Fe/H]} < -1.5$, RUWE $> 2$, and $G
< 15$. Our search has yielded one promising target exhibiting slow acceleration
and an RV more than 98 km s$^{-1}$ different from its DR3 mean RV, as well as
dozens of other candidates with smaller RV discrepancies. We quantify the
sensitivity of our search using simulations, demonstrating that it recovers at
least half of the BH companions within our selection criteria. We make all the
spectra and RVs from our survey publicly available and encourage further
follow-up.

Abstract: The majority of merging white dwarfs leave behind a white dwarf remnant.
Hot/warm DQ white dwarfs with carbon-rich atmospheres have high masses and
unusual kinematics. All evidence points to a merger origin. Here, we
demonstrate that far-UV + optical photometry provides an efficient way to
identify these merger remnants. We take advantage of this photometric selection
to identify 167 candidates in the GALEX All-Sky Imaging Survey footprint, and
provide follow-up spectroscopy. Out of the 140 with spectral classifications,
we identify 75 warm DQ white dwarfs with $T_{\rm eff}>10,000$ K, nearly
tripling the number of such objects known. Our sample includes 13 DAQ white
dwarfs with spectra dominated by hydrogen and (weaker) carbon lines. Ten of
these are new discoveries, including the hottest DAQ known to date with $T_{\rm
eff}\approx23,000$ K and $M=1.31~M_{\odot}$. We provide a model atmosphere
analysis of all warm DQ white dwarfs found, and present their temperature and
mass distributions. The sample mean and standard deviation are $T_{\rm eff} =
14,560 \pm 1970$ K and $M=1.11 \pm 0.09~M_{\odot}$. Warm DQs are roughly twice
as massive as the classical DQs found at cooler temperatures. All warm DQs are
found on or near the crystallization sequence. Even though their estimated
cooling ages are of order 1 Gyr, their kinematics indicate an origin in the
thick disk or halo. Hence, they are likely stuck on the crystallization
sequence for $\sim$10 Gyr due to significant cooling delays from distillation
of neutron-rich impurities. Future all-sky far-UV surveys like UVEX have the
potential to significantly expand this sample.

Abstract: We aim to identify the cluster members, estimate cluster properties, study
the dynamical state of the clusters as a function of mass, trace the existence
of dynamical effects in massive stars, and check for spatial patterns of
members in young clusters. We studied 14 young open clusters located within 1
kpc using the data from Gaia DR3 with the membership estimated using the GMM
method. The cluster parameters such as age, distance, metallicity, and
extinction were estimated by fitting PARSEC isochrones to the CMDs. These
clusters are found to have ages between 6-90 Myr, located between 334-910 pc,
covering a mass range, of 0.13 to 13.77 solar mass. In five of these clusters,
stars from F to M spectral type show increasing velocity dispersion, a
signature for dynamical relaxation. We detect high proper motion for B and
A-type stars, possible walkaway stars in the other five clusters, Alessi
Teutsch 5, ASCC 16, ASCC 21, IC 2395, and NGC 6405. We demonstrate the
existence of mass-dependent velocity dispersion in young clusters suggestive of
dynamical relaxation. The typical range of transverse velocity dispersion is
found to be 0.40 - 0.70 km/s for young clusters.

Abstract: The experimental verification of the quantum nature of gravity represents a
milestone in quantum gravity research. Recently, interest has grown for testing
it via gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE). Here, we propose a
space-based interferometer inspired by the LISA Pathfinder (LPF). Unlike the
LPF, our design employs two smaller gold-platinum test masses, each weighing
the milligram scale, surrounded by a shield below 2 K, and positioned side by
side with a millimeter scale separation. This configuration enables the
detection of GIE through simultaneous measurements of differential and
common-mode motions. We simulate quantum measurements of these modes taking
into account gas damping, black-body radiation, and cosmic-ray collisions to
estimate the integration time for GIE detection. Our results show that GIE can
be demonstrated with a few modifications to the LPF setup.

Abstract: A four-vector potential of an external test electromagnetic field in a
Schwarzschild background is described in terms of a combination of dipole and
quadrupole magnetic fields. This combination is an interior solution of the
source-free Maxwell equations. Such external test magnetic fields cause the
dynamics of charged particles around the black hole to be nonintegrable, and
are mainly responsible for chaotic dynamics of charged particles. In addition
to the external magnetic fields, some circumstances should be required for the
onset of chaos. The effect of the magnetic fields on chaos is shown clearly
through an explicit symplectic integrator and a fast Lyapunov indicator. The
inclusion of the quadrupole magnetic fields easily induces chaos, compared with
that of the dipole magnetic fields. This result is because the Lorentz forces
from the quadrupole magnetic fields are larger than those from the dipole
magnetic fields. In addition, the Lorentz forces act as attractive forces,
which are helpful to bring the occurrence of chaos in the nonintegrable case.
