Therefore, it can provide invaluable information on the fate of clouds, and the sites of star formation. Our objective was to study the accuracy with which we can measure the true mass-to-flux ratio in molecular clouds under various projection angles and identify systematic biases. We used a 3D nonideal magnetohydrodynamic chemo-dynamical simulation of a turbulent collapsing molecular cloud. We quantified the accuracy with which the mass-to-flux ratio is recovered under various projection angles and dynamical stages by analyzing the magnetic field - gas column density relation, and comparing the \"observed\" mass-to-flux ratio against the true values. We find that projection effects have a major effect on measurements of the mass-to-flux ratio. Zeeman measurements can overestimate the true mass-to-flux ratio of the cloud by more than an order of magnitude when the magnetic field primarily lies on the plane of the sky. Therefore, measurements of the mass-to-flux ratio based on Zeeman observations should be considered as upper limits.

We seek to understand the possible reason behind the apparent absence of dust in the Blue Monsters. We show how clustered supernovae drive mechanical blowout in stratified, self-gravitating clouds by combining full 3-D hydrodynamical dust-survival yields with 3-D thin-shell scalings, and we predict the retained dust-to-stellar mass ratio at the cluster scale and the corresponding galaxy-integrated value. We take the net dust yield per unit stellar mass from existing 3-D hydrodynamical studies of young stellar clusters with sequential supernovae, and we set the blowout radius as a function of gas concentration using established 3-D thin-shell scalings. Assuming gas-dust coupling across the blowout boundary, the retained dust-to-stellar ratio accounts for the fraction of supernovae that remain confined versus those that vent mechanically. Across typical cluster masses, sizes, and cloud-scale star formation efficiencies, mechanical venting removes a large share of gas and dust. The retained dust-to-stellar mass ratio is lowered by about half to two orders of magnitude relative to the supernova net dust yield. The outcome depends mainly on gas concentration and only weakly on metallicity, so it remains effective at low $Z$. After weighting by a Schechter cluster mass function and a Weibull core-radius distribution, the galaxy-integrated value falls in the same range inferred for spectroscopically confirmed Blue Monsters. Thus, mechanical venting at the cluster scale can account for the very low dust fractions inferred for Blue Monsters without requiring extreme in situ destruction and without fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "研究发现超早期蓝怪物星系（Blue Monsters）中尘埃含量极低的原因是星团尺度上超新星爆发驱动的机械性喷流（mechanical venting）有效移除了大部分尘埃，其保留的尘埃-恒星质量比仅为超新星净尘埃产量的1/2至两个数量级，与观测结果一致。", "background": "研究聚焦于高红移(z≳10)极年轻星系\"蓝色怪物\"(Blue Monsters)中尘埃含量异常低的现象，探讨超新星驱动机械喷流在分层自引力云中清除尘埃的物理机制。", "data": "数据来源包括三维流体力学模拟（3-D hydrodynamical simulation）中年轻星团（young stellar clusters）的超新星（supernovae）尘埃存活率数据，以及三维薄壳标度（3-D thin-shell scaling）确定的喷流半径（blowout radius）与气体浓度的函数关系。", "method": "采用三维流体力学尘埃存活产额与三维薄壳标度相结合的方法，分析分层自引力云中成团超新星驱动的机械喷流机制。", "result": "通过结合三维流体力学尘埃存活产额与三维薄壳标度分析，发现星团尺度上超新星机械性喷流导致尘埃与恒星质量比降低0.5-2个数量级，主要取决于气体浓度而非金属丰度，从而解释了蓝怪物星系（Blue Monsters）极低尘埃含量的观测特征。"}}

As researchers plan for more missions beyond Earth, there is a demand for accessible tools that help better predict and understand the thermal effects on their spacecraft in orbital environments around Earth and other bodies. While commercial thermal analysis tools offer high-fidelity modeling capabilities and results, they are often expensive and require extensive training to be used effectively. This paper details a framework for a user-friendly Satellite Thermal Model (SATMO) to support the early stages of space mission planning for CubeSats orbiting Earth and other Solar System bodies. SATMO is an open-source, MATLAB-based, six-node thermal analysis program designed for satellites in low-altitude circular orbits. Although SATMO requires a MATLAB license -- typically inexpensive or institutionally provided in academic settings -- it remains substantially more accessible than professional thermal analysis software. SATMO requires an internet connection for some features but does not rely on additional MATLAB toolboxes.

One promising method to study DM is detecting DM subhalos through their gravitational interactions with stellar streams. In this study, we apply Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) to constrain subhalo interaction parameters, including mass, scale radius, velocity, and encounter geometry, from stellar stream kinematics. We generate particle spray simulations based on the Lagrange Cloud stripping technique, focusing on the ATLAS-Aliqa Uma stream as a test case. We train multiple NPE models across multiple observational scenarios, quantifying how kinematic completeness affects inference and forecasting constraints from upcoming surveys including LSST, 4MOST, and 10-year Gaia data.

Under realistic observational conditions, mass uncertainties range from 50% (present-day) to 20-40% (future scenarios), with comparable performance between the photometric-only LSST sample and a smaller sample that includes Gaia proper motions and 4MOST radial velocities. Most notably, we find that velocity bimodality emerges when phase space is poorly sampled, whether due to missing kinematic information or limited stellar tracers.

In particular, GWs induced by primordial isocurvature perturbations encode information of novel dynamics beyond the standard $Λ$CDM model. Existing studies of isocurvature induced GWs focus on a particular type: cold dark matter (CDM) isocurvature. In this work, we present a more comprehensive study of four kinds of isocurvature involving CDM, baryons, neutrinos and free-streaming dark radiation (DR). We first reformulate initial conditions of isocurvature with coupled neutrinos because modes relevant for observations at Pulsar Timing Arrays enter the horizon before neutrino decoupling. With these new initial conditions, neutrino isocurvature is phenomenologically similar to CDM isocurvature up to an overall coefficient, which leads to an interesting conversion of isocurvature between radiation and matter sectors. We then find that the spectrum of isocurvature induced GWs from free-streaming DR is qualitatively different than that from CDM due to the presence of anisotropic stress. Unlike GWs induced by CDM isocurvature that are suppressed at high frequencies due to matter density being suppressed at early times, DR isocurvature induced GWs is proportional to the constant ratio between DR density and total radiation. Finally, we utilize two general parametrizations of the isocurvature power spectrum: a delta function and a broken power law, and derive novel constraints with recent NANOGrav data.

Understanding how they attain such scales demands examining their large scale cosmic surroundings, particularly the under explored filament environment. We quantify the three dimensional (3D) distance of GRGs from the nearest filament spine; test how this distance correlates with their growth and formation of different morphological classes; assess whether their radio jets exhibit preferred orientations relative to filament axes; and examine how filament anisotropy from spine to periphery modulates radio morphology. We employed a filament catalogue from the SDSS together with the largest GRG catalogue currently available. For each source, we measured the comoving distance to the nearest filament spine, the projected jet spine orientation angle, and quantified lobe asymmetry via the arm length ratio (ALR). These metrics trace proximity, directionality, and the impact of filamentary environment on morphology. We then compared GRGs with a control sample of small radio galaxies (SRGs) to constrain the environmental factors that regulate the attainment of giant sizes. We validated the robustness of our results via bootstrap resampling and non parametric statistical tests. Our results show that GRGs and SRGs have similar filament occupancy. By contrast, GRGs preferentially display larger alignment angles relative to filament spines, while SRG orientations are consistent with a random distribution. GRGs further show enhanced morphological asymmetry, reflected in lower ALR values than SRGs. Attainment of giant sizes is not governed by proximity to filaments; rather, it correlates with jet filament alignment.

The finite element model is established by thermal analysis software and thermal simulation is carried out. in that steady state, the work temperature range of the CCD chip is -12.8 to -10.9 celsius, which meets the temperature control index, and the work temperatures of other components are also within the design requirements, which indicate that the thermal design scheme is reasonable and feasible, and meets the task requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "采用柔性石墨导热电缆和槽道热管（grooved heat pipes）的热设计方案使波前相机焦平面组件（focal plane assembly）的CCD芯片工作温度稳定在-12.8至-10.9摄氏度，满足系外行星成像日冕仪模块（exoplanet imaging coronagraph module）的散热需求。", "background": "研究聚焦于系外行星成像日冕仪模块中波前相机焦平面组件（focal plane assembly）的热管理设计，以确保其成像质量和可靠性。", "data": "采用热分析软件建立有限元模型并进行热仿真（thermal simulation），数据来源于稳态下CCD芯片及其他组件的温度测量结果。", "method": "采用柔性石墨烯导热电缆和沟槽热管进行散热路径设计，并通过热分析软件建立有限元模型进行热仿真。", "result": "采用柔性石墨烯导热电缆和槽道热管的热设计方案使CCD芯片在稳态下工作温度范围为-12.8至-10.9摄氏度，满足温控指标。"}}

To measure this cosmological signal, the Dark-ages EXplorer (DEX) has been proposed as a compact, grid-based radio array on the lunar farside. The minimal design consists of a 32 $\\times$ 32 array of 3-m dipole antennas, operating in the $7 - 50$ MHz band. A practical challenge on the lunar surface is that the antennas may get displaced from their intended positions due to deployment imprecisions and non-coplanarity arising from local surface undulations. We present, for the first time, an end-to-end simulation pipeline, called SPADE-21cm, that integrates a sky model with a DA 21-cm signal model simulated in the lunar frame and incorporating lunar topography data. We study the effects of both lateral (xy) and vertical (z) offsets on the two-dimensional power spectra across the $7 - 12$ MHz and $30 - 35$ MHz spectral windows, with tolerance thresholds derived only for the latter.

Our model adopts mass- and metallicity-dependent nucleosynthetic yields from modern stellar grids and explores a wide GCE parameter space in infall timing, star formation efficiency, mass partitioning, IMF upper mass, and SN Ia normalization, optimized via a hybrid genetic algorithm with MCMC refinement. The later infall features a reduced star formation efficiency (Delta SFE ~ 0.72), reproducing the metal-rich peak of the bulge metallicity distribution function (MDF) and the decline in [alpha/Fe] at high [Fe/H]. Our model naturally favors the Joyce et al. (2023) age--metallicity relation over the ages in Bensby et al. (2017).

Here, we instead consider the possibility that these heavy states have masses comparable to the dark matter mass and are charged under a new kinetically-mixed $U(1)'$.

Focusing on the single exchange of a massive scalar field, we demonstrate that the trispectrum splits cleanly into its local and non-local components once the heavy-field propagators are decomposed in the Keldysh basis. Integrating out the massive degree of freedom yields a single-field effective field theory for the light scalar that necessarily contains both unitary operators and non-unitary contributions associated with dissipation and stochastic noise.

The MWISP survey was conducted using the PMO 13.7 m telescope at a spatial resolution of approximately 50\" and a velocity resolution of 0.16 km/s at 115 GHz. DR1 fully covered 2310 square degrees within the Galactic longitude (l) and latitude (b) range of 9.75 deg =< l=< 229.75 deg and |b| =< 5.25 deg. The surveyed area was divided into cell units of 30'x30' for practical purposes and On-The-Fly (OTF) mapping was performed toward each target cell unit. The data were regridded into a regular 3D datacube in l-b-V_LSR with a pixel size of 30\" in l-b axes and 0.16 km/s in theV_LSR axis.

Interestingly, repeating FRBs tend to exhibit broader temporal widths and narrower spectral bandwidths compared to non-repeat events, suggesting they may arise from different physical mechanisms. However, current radio telescopes have limited coverage and sensitivity, which hinders a complete survey with continuous long-term monitoring. This issue makes it difficult to confirm repeat activity and potentially leads to misclassification of repeaters as non- repeaters; these are referred to as repeater candidates.

We present a large and homogeneous sample of bright quasars identified from the Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) by combining high-purity candidate selections from Gaia and WISE with the NISP spectra. Through visual inspection of the Euclid spectra of these quasar candidates, we identify approximately 3500 quasars with reliable redshifts at $0<z\\lesssim 4.8$. We generate the first Euclid composite spectrum of quasars covering rest-frame NUV to NIR wavelengths without telluric lines, which will be pivotal to NIR quasar spectral analysis. We obtain an empirical spectroscopic depth of $J_{\\rm E}\\lesssim 21.5$ and $H_{\\rm E}\\lesssim 21.3$ at the sensitivity of the Wide Field Survey, beyond which the number of securely identified quasars declines sharply. We analyse VIS morphologies using Sersic and CAS metrics, and a deep-learning PSF fraction to track nuclear dominance. At low redshift ($z<0.5$), obvious host structures are common and a single Sersic model fits about half of the sources; at intermediate redshift ($0.5<z<2$), the nuclear component dominates, with 90% of the Sersic fits saturating at the upper index limit. In this intermediate redshift regime, $f_{\\rm PSF}$ is available, and we use it as a more reliable compactness measure than the single-Sersic and CAS parameters to quantify nuclear versus host emission. We also explore the novel Euclid NIR colour space and discuss the role of these quasars in refining AGN selection techniques for future Euclid data releases.

This work compiles all available literature data for dwarf galaxies with confident stellar mass and GC count estimates, and converts these estimates to GCS masses and peak halo masses using a standard conversion. This allows for a consistent comparison of these masses to be made and a complete study of the behaviour of the $M_{GCS}-M_h$ relation to be conducted.

Wherever possible, we present analytical estimates of the production rates and yields, and verify their accuracy numerically. For dark photons lighter than twice the electron masses (around 1 MeV), we find that our analytical estimate of the freeze-in yield based on resonant production is very accurate, implying that off-resonance contributions can be neglected in practice.

This fraction is lower than predicted by simulations, which suggest that fast outflowing gas should be a common feature of all star-forming galaxies in the early Universe. Aims: In order to better understand the discrepancies between simulations and observations, we identify and characterize outflows in high-redshift galaxies using the TNG50 cosmological and SERRA zoom-in simulations. Our study examines how outflow detectability depends on the line of sight, explores the properties of the fast gas, and investigates its relationship with key galactic properties. Methods: We analyse approximately 60000 galaxies from TNG50 and 3000 galaxies from SERRA over the redshift ranges z=3-5 and z=4-5, respectively, spanning stellar masses of Mstar=10^7.5-10^11Msun. Outflows in the immediate vicinity of each galaxy are identified using a Gaussian mixture model algorithm that uses the gas velocity, star-formation-rate, and location as input parameters. We subsequently compare the simulated outflows to those observed in the JWST/JADES NIRSpec survey. Results: Outflow masses in both TNG50 and SERRA broadly reproduce the JWST/JADES measurements within roughly 0.5dex, though simulations tend to predict slightly higher values, suggesting that optical emission lines capture only a fraction of the multiphase outflow. However, simulated outflow velocities are typically an order of magnitude lower than those inferred from observations.

While the LSST survey strategy is still being finalized, the Rubin Observatory team has generated a series of survey simulations using the LSST Operations Simulator to explore the optimal survey strategy that best accommodates the majority of scientific goals. In this study, we utilize the latest simulated data to predict the number of detectable quasars by LSST in each band and evaluate the impact of different survey strategies. We find that the number of quasars and lower luminosity AGNs detected in the baseline strategy (v4.3.1) in the redshift range z=0.3-6.7 will be highest in the i-band and lowest in the u-band. Over 70% of quasars are expected to be detected within the first year in all bands, as LSST will have already reached the break of the luminosity function at most redshifts. With a limiting magnitude of 25.7 mag, we expect to detect 184 million AGNs in the z-band over the 10-year survey, with quasars constituting only 6% of the total AGNs in each band. This arises because, considering that the luminosities of most low-luminosity AGNs are affected by contamination from their host galaxies, we set a magnitude threshold when predicting the number of quasars. We find that variations in the u-band strategy can impact the number of quasar detections. Specifically, the difference between the baseline strategy and that with the largest total exposure in u is 15%.

Models predict a continuum of outcomes for the fastest ejecta, from choked to ultra-relativistic jets, and observations from radio to X-rays are key to probing these scenarios across a range of viewing angles and velocities.

As a result, the model achieves the best average mean squared error (MSE) of 5.04 in the A-SLOTH data set. Our model also shows good agreement with existing observational studies of MW satellites, although some discrepancies remain due to a few outliers such as CVn II and UMa I.

Our results show that repulsive self-interactions lead to more massive and extended cores with lower central densities compared to the free (non-interacting) fuzzy dark matter case, while attractive interactions enhance central densities and can drive cores toward collapse, once a critical mass is exceeded. We confirm that the mass-radius relation of solitonic cores is well described by analytical predictions, even in the presence of self-interactions, and we extend the core-halo mass relation to scenarios beyond fuzzy dark matter. We find that the scaling relations between core mass, size, and total energy are not universal but depend sensitively on the strength and sign of the self-interaction, as well as on the evolutionary stage of the halo.

These systems have AU-scale separations and are thought to have undergone mass transfer (MT) when the WD progenitor was an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. Using high-resolution spectroscopy, we measure chemical abundances of the MS stars, focusing on s-process elements. Since s-process nucleosynthesis occurs mainly in AGB stars, s-process enhancement in the MS star is a key signature of accretion from an AGB companion. We identify 40 barium dwarfs -- 36 of them newly discovered -- roughly doubling the known population in astrometric WD+MS binaries and extending it to lower metallicities than previously studied. The s-process abundances show large star-to-star variations that correlate with component masses and with metallicity but not with orbital separation. At the lowest metallicities, three barium dwarfs display strong CH and $\\rm C_2$ absorption bands, linking them to CEMP-s stars and implying that AGB mass transfer usually leads to strong carbon enhancement at low metallicity. By comparing the observed abundance patterns to AGB nucleosynthesis models, we show that the diversity of s-process enhancements can be explained by variations in donor mass, metallicity, and most importantly, the number of thermal pulses the AGB star experienced before the onset of MT. Variation in the depth of the accretors' convective envelopes, with which accreted material is diluted, strengthens correlations with MS star mass and metallicity.

We inject SLFs into random realizations of damped random walk (DRW) lightcurves, representing stochastic quasar variability, and compute the LS periodogram with and without the SLF.
