We find that the\nmajority of stars in the tail are formed close to the galaxy disc at the\nbeginning of stripping. Most stars have ages that reflect outside-in stripping\n-- older stars are found at larger radii than younger stars. The velocities and\nmetallicities of stars indicate that ICM mixing both increases the velocity and\ndecreases the metallicity of star-forming gas, leading to faster, lower\nmetallicity stars at larger distances from the galaxies. However, not all stars\nfollow this simple model, even in the case of face-on stripping. Indeed, a\nconsiderable number (15--25 per cent) of tail stars are formed with negative\nvelocities, indicating the fallback of star-forming gas on to the galaxy.\nAlmost all of the tail stars formed within 20 kpc from the disc will eventually\nfall back on to the galaxy, and their contribution to the intracluster light is\nnegligible. The orbits of the stars formed in the tail result in an extended\n(and asymmetric in the case of W45) stellar distribution around the disc.

Using a sample of open clusters and mock\nfield stars, we conduct a bootstrap analysis to evaluate every unique\ncombination of orbital components ($E, J_R, J_\\phi, J_Z$) and chemical\nabundances ([X/Fe] for O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Y, and\nBa) on how well they recover open clusters when used as parameters in the\nclustering algorithm, HBDSCAN.

After\nrandomly sampling masses from an environmentally-dependent star cluster initial\nmass function, we assign to each object a half-mass radius, metallicity, and\ndistance from the galaxy centre.
