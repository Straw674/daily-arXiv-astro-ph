The \"heavy-seed\" pathway eases the problem with the\nprogenitors of these SMBHs having birth masses up to ${\\sim} 10^5~{\\rm\nM_\\odot}$. Here, we investigate the possibility that a local dwarf galaxy, Leo\nI, harbors a heavy-seed descendant. Using Monte-Carlo merger trees to generate\nthe merger histories of 1,000 dark matter halos similar to the Milky Way (MW;\nwith a mass of ${\\sim} 10^{12}~{\\rm M_\\odot}$ at redshift $z{=}0$). We search\nfor Leo-like satellite halos among these merger trees, and investigate the\nprobability that the progenitors of some of these satellites formed a heavy\nseed. We derive the likelihood of such \"heavy seed survivors\" (HSSs) across\nvarious formation and survival criteria as well as Leo-similarity criteria. We\nfind that the virial temperature for the onset of atomic cooling and rapid gas\ninfall that yields heavy seeds, $T_{\\rm act}$, has the largest impact on the\nnumber of HSSs. We find HSSs in a fraction $0.7\\%$, $18.1\\%$, and $96.5\\%$ of\nMW-like halos when $T_{\\rm act}$ is set to $9,000$K, $7,000$K, and $5,000$K\nrespectively.

Abstract\n  abridged to satisfy arXiv requirements", "summary": "Determining the structure of the Milky Way is essential for understanding its\nmorphology, dynamics, and evolution. However, studying its innermost regions is\nchallenging due to high extinction and crowding. The detection of a double red\nclump (RC; core-helium-burning stars) feature at very low Galactic latitudes\nsuggests the presence of a spiral arm beyond the Galactic bar, providing new\ninsights into the Galaxy's structure along this complex line of sight. We\nevaluate this possibility by analysing the proper motion and extinction\ndistributions of the detected RC features. We constructed proper motion and\nextinction difference maps to investigate the kinematic and reddening\nproperties of the RC populations, and the kinematic differences were validated\nusing N-body simulations of a Milky Way-like galaxy. We find that the two RC\nfeatures are kinematically distinct, with a relative proper motion difference\nof $-0.16\\pm0.02\\, mas/yr$ in the component parallel to the Galactic plane.\nThis difference can be explained by Galactic rotation if the two RCs lie at\ndifferent distances, consistent with the simulations. The extinction towards\nthe secondary RC is also $\\sim0.05$ mag higher than that of the primary RC.\nAdditionally, we estimate that the extinction difference between the RC\nfeatures corresponds to only $\\sim5\\%$ of the total extinction from Earth to\nthe first RC, suggesting little interstellar material between the farthest edge\nof the Galactic bar and the kinematically distinct structure traced by the\nsecondary RC. Using $JK_s$ photometry, we derive $A_J/A_{K_s}=3.34\\pm0.07$,\nconsistent with previous results and showing no significant variation across\nfields or along the line of sight.

When the host galaxy redshift is known,\nfor example, through observation of an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart, GW\ndetections can provide an independent measurement of the Hubble constant,\n$H_0$. However, even in the absence of an EM counterpart, inferring $H_0$ is\npossible through the dark siren method. In this approach, every galaxy in the\nGW localization volume is considered a potential host that contributes to a\nmeasurement of $H_0$, with redshift information supplied by galaxy catalogs.\nUsing mock galaxy catalogs, we explore the effect of catalog incompleteness on\ndark siren measurements of $H_0$. We find that in the case of well-localized GW\nevents, if GW hosts are found in all galaxies with host halo masses $M_h > 2\n\\times10^{11} M_{\\odot}h^{-1}$, catalogs only need to be complete down to the\n1% brightest magnitude $M_i < -22.43$ to draw an unbiased, informative\nposterior on H0. We demonstrate that this is a direct result of the clustering\nof fainter galaxies around brighter and more massive galaxies. For a mock\ngalaxy catalog without clustering, or for GW localization volumes that are too\nlarge, using only the brightest galaxies results in a biased $H_0$ posterior.\nThese results are important for informing future dark siren analyses with\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA as well as next-generation detectors."}

In NGC 6860, a molecular outflow surrounding the bipolar\nemission of the [O III] ionized gas is observed extending up to $R_{out}$ ~ 560\npc from the nucleus. There is evidence of molecular inflows along the stellar\nbar, although an alternative scenario, involving a decoupled rotation in a\ncircumnuclear disk (CND) can also explain the observed kinematics. Mrk 915\nshows double-peak CO profiles along one of its spiral arms.

The CO in the CND is rotating while outflowing within\n$R_{out}$ ~ 3 kpc, with the disturbances possibly being caused by the passage\nof the ionized gas outflow. Overall, the mass inflow rates are larger than the\naccretion rate needed to produce the observed luminosities, suggesting that\nonly a fraction of the inflowing gas ends up feeding the central black holes.\nAlthough we found signatures of AGN feedback on the cold molecular phase, the\nmass outflow rates of ~ 0.09-3 M$_\\odot$/yr indicate an overall weak impact at\nthese AGN luminosities.

This provides the first concrete\nrealization of a CPT-breaking, yet normalizable, gravitational vacuum state\nrooted in a nonperturbative quantum gravity framework. Our results establish\nthe CSK state-long thought formal-as a viable candidate for the ground state of\nquantum gravity in de Sitter space."}

While parameter estimation\nis achievable with unnormalised posteriors traditionally obtained via MCMC\nmethods, comprehensive model comparison and tension quantification require\nBayesian evidences and normalised posteriors, which remain computationally\nprohibitive for many researchers. To address this, we present\n$\\texttt{unimpeded}$, a publicly available Python library and data repository\nproviding DiRAC-funded (DP192 and 264) pre-computed nested sampling and MCMC\nchains with their normalised posterior samples, computed using\n$\\texttt{Cobaya}$ and the Boltzmann solver $\\texttt{CAMB}$.\n$\\texttt{unimpeded}$ delivers systematic analysis across a grid of eight\ncosmological models (including $\\Lambda$CDM and seven extensions) and 39 modern\ncosmological datasets (comprising individual probes and their pairwise\ncombinations). The built-in tension statistics calculator enables rapid\ncomputation of six tension quantification metrics. All chains are hosted on\nZenodo with permanent access via the unimpeded API, analogous to the renowned\nPlanck Legacy Archive but utilising nested sampling in addition to traditional\nMCMC methods."}
