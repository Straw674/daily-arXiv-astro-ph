The majority of previous work has utilised N-body\nsimulations with a background potential to model the effects of gas removal.\nHere, we adopt a different approach where we take the end point of hydrodynamic\nsimulations of star formation in which stars form with and without feedback\nfrom massive stars and then evolve the stars as N-body simulations. We also\nscale the velocities of the stars to various virial ratios, to mimic slower or\nfaster removal of gas, and evolve these as additional N-body simulations. We\nfind that the simulations where the stars inherit the velocities of the sink\nparticles from the hydrodynamic simulations predominantly evolve more like a\nsimulation in virial equilibrium, rather than the supervirial behaviour we\nwould expect after gas removal. We see no significant differences in the\ndynamical evolution between the simulations where the stars inherit velocities\ndirectly from the hydrodynamical simulations and the simulations with\n(sub)virial velocities. This strongly suggests that gas removal by feedback\nprocesses does not lead to rapid expansion of star-forming regions, beyond the\nexpansion caused by dynamical relaxation in star-forming regions."}

We observe a flatter MZR\nslope than the SPHINX$^{20}$ and FLARES simulations, which cannot be attributed\nto selection effects. With simple models, we show that the effect of an [O III]\nflux-limited sample on the observed shape of the MZR is strongly dependent on\nthe FMR. If the FMR is similar to the one in the local Universe, the intrinsic\nhigh-redshift MZR should be even flatter than observed. In turn, a 3D relation\nwhere SFR correlates positively with metallicity at fixed mass would imply an\nintrinsically steeper MZR. Our measurements indicate that metallicity\nvariations at fixed mass show little dependence on the SFR, suggesting a flat\nintrinsic MZR. This could indicate that the low-mass galaxies at these\nredshifts are out of equilibrium and that metal enrichment occurs rapidly in\nlow-mass galaxies. However, being limited by our stacking analysis, we are yet\nto probe the scatter in the MZR and its dependence on SFR. Large carefully\nselected samples of galaxies with robust metallicity measurements can put tight\nconstraints on the high-redshift FMR and, help to understand the interplay\nbetween gas flows, star formation and feedback in early galaxies."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are known to correlate with many properties\nof their host galaxies, but we do not fully understand these correlations. The\nstrengths (tightness) of these correlations have also been widely debated. In\nthis work, we explore SMBH-host relations in three state-of-the-art\ncosmological simulations: Illustris, TNG, and EAGLE. Using a variety of machine\nlearning regressors, we measure the scaling relations between black hole mass\n($M_{\\rm BH}$) and galaxy properties including stellar velocity dispersion\n($\\sigma$), stellar mass ($M_{\\star}$), dark matter halo mass ($M_{\\rm Halo}$),\nand the Sersic index. We find that machine learning regressors provide\npredictive capabilities superior to linear regression in many scaling relations\nin simulations, and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor has the strongest\nperformance. SMBH-host relations have different strengths in different\nsimulations as a result of their sub-grid models. Similar to the observations,\nthe $M_{\\rm BH} $-$\\sigma$ relation is a strong correlation in all simulations,\nbut in TNG, the $M_{\\rm BH} $-$M_{\\star}$ relation is even tighter than $M_{\\rm\nBH} $-$\\sigma$. EAGLE produces the weakest SMBH-host correlations among all\nsimulations. Low mass SMBHs tend to be poorly correlated with their host\ngalaxies, but including them can still help machines better grasp the\ncorrelations in Illustris and TNG. Combining galaxy properties that strongly\ncorrelate with $M_{\\rm BH} $ but poorly correlate with each other can improve\nMLP's performance. $M_{\\rm BH} $ is most accurately predicted when all galaxy\nproperties are included in the training, suggesting that SMBH-host correlations\nare fundamentally multi-dimensional in these simulations."}

The water vapour density profile\nfollows an exponential decay with a characteristic half-height of about 1000 m.\nMedian PWV in 2012-2018 is 3.3 mm.

The local nature of this\nframework allows for focusing computational power close to the binary at the\nexpense of detaching the gas flow around the binary from the global dynamics.\nIn this paper, we provide a framework to assess the applicability of the\nshearing box for studying the long-term evolution of the orbital elements of\nthe embedded binary in viscous hydrodynamic disks.

While white dwarfs are abundant in the universe and relatively well\nunderstood, their gravitational wave signals have not yet been directly\nobserved. In order to detect gravitational waves from merging white dwarf\nbinaries, a detector in the mid-band between LVK and LISA appears necessary. In\nthis paper, we compute and discuss the gravitational waves emitted by\ninspiraling and merging white dwarf binaries, and assess their detectability\nwith proposed space-based atom-interferometer detectors such as MAGIS Space and\nAEDGE. Gravitational waves from massive white dwarf binaries can be observed\nfor many years before merger, offering a unique early warning of their final\nexplosion. Our projections suggest that MAGIS Space could detect signals from\nType Ia supernova progenitors at least once every four years, while AEDGE could\nobserve at least a few hundred such events annually. The prolonged\ngravitational wave emission captured by atom-interferometers provides precise\nsky localisation and can allow observation of the final explosion with\nelectromagnetic telescopes. The combined observation with electromagnetic\nradiation from the white dwarf binary coalescence could open a new pathway for\nmulti-messenger astronomy involving some of the brightest transient events in\nthe universe."}

We apply a statistical formalism to measure the significance of\ncoincidence for the catalog as a whole, measuring that less than 3\\% (90\\%\ncredible interval) of LVK BBH mergers give rise to observable AGN flares. This\nresult still allows up to $\\sim 40\\%$ of BBH mergers to originate in AGN disks.\nWe also examine the individual coincidences of each merger/flare pairing,\ndetermining that in all cases the flares are more likely to belong to a\nbackground population of flares not associated with GW events. Our results are\nconsistent with theoretical predictions accounting for the observability of EM\ncounterparts in AGN disks, as well as based on the fact that the most massive\nAGNs (such as those included in the search) are not expected to harbor the\nmajority of the BBHs.

We then increase significantly the number of\nconstraints around the position of SN H0pe by modeling the extended surface\nbrightness of the SN host galaxy. The average uncertainty on mass model\nparameters is reduced by more than an order of magnitude. We also study the\nspatial distribution of dust in the arc to estimate the dust extinction at the\nposition of SN H0pe.
