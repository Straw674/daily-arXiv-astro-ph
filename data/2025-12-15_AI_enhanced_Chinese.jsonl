Next, there are periodic features: not only oscillations, but also convective cells and starspots, which appear to transit across a star as its spins, and exoplanets that really do transit across the star. Then, there are transients like flares.\n  Current optical interferometers provide synthetic apertures of a few hundred metres and angular resolutions down to about nanoradian ($\\simeq 0.2\\,$milliarcsecond), enough to resolve some of the above features on the nearest upper main-sequence stars, giants and supergiants.

Although O2 is an important precursor molecule present during the early stages of ice formation, its surface diffusion in ASW remains poorly constrained. In this study, we experimentally investigate the surface diffusion and the entrapment efficiency of O2 in porous ASW under astrophysically relevant conditions. Experiments were conducted in an ultra-high vacuum chamber and monitored using infrared (IR) spectroscopy and quadrupole mass spectrometry. Diffusion coefficients were extracted through a novel approach applicable to IR-inactive molecules, by fitting the mass spectrometer signal during the isothermal phase with a Fickian model. These coefficients were then used to derive the diffusion energy barrier of O2 in ASW. Entrapment efficiencies were measured by analyzing the subsequent temperature-programmed desorption phase. We measured the surface diffusion coefficients at different temperatures (35 K, 40 K, 45 K) and water ice coverages (40 ML, 60 ML, 80 ML), yielding values on the order of 1E-16 to 1E-15 cm^2 s^-1. From these values, we derived a diffusion energy barrier of ED = 10 +/- 3 meV (116 +/- 35 K), corresponding to a chi ratio of about 0.1. Entrapment measurements revealed that a residual amount of about 20% of O2 remains trapped in the ASW matrix at the highest temperatures investigated. This work demonstrates that the surface diffusion of IR-inactive molecules can be experimentally quantified using mass spectrometry.

While the power spectrum of these models has been extensively studied, higher-order correlations are much less understood. Motivated by the complex physics involved and the fact that PBH and SIGW formation are both sensitive to non-linearities, we present a detailed study of the bispectrum as the leading non-linear effect in these scenarios. We refer to the scale- and shape-dependence of the bispectrum collectively as its geometry; and define a scale-dependent shape correlator to disentangle the two dependencies. Generally, we find that for the scales most affected by phase transitions and particle production (including the power spectrum peak), the bispectrum is strongest near the equilateral configuration, while non-attractor phases tend to produce correlations near the squeezed configuration. We further propose a simplified bispectrum estimator, resembling local-type non-Gaussianity but with scale-dependent amplitude, that captures the main features of the full bispectrum. As an implication of our results, we show that incorporating the bispectrum significantly broadens the range of scales with a substantial probability of large smoothed density contrasts compared to linear analysis. This suggests that non-linearities can alter not only PBH abundance and SIGW amplitude but also their mass and frequency spectra.

This makes the intracluster medium (ICM) an ideal astrophysical system to constrain its chemical composition, hence ultimately understand metal production and enrichment on megaparsec scales. In this work, we take advantage of the unprecedented ~5 eV resolution offered by XRISM/Resolve to measure the chemical composition of the core of the bright, nearby, and metal-rich Centaurus cluster (287 ks) with unprecedented accuracy. We use these measurements to provide constraints on the stellar populations having enriched the cluster core. We derived the Fe abundance and its relative Si/Fe, S/Fe, Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, Cr/Fe, Mn/Fe, and Ni/Fe ratios. We completed this high-resolution view with N/Fe, O/Fe, Ne/Fe, and Mg/Fe ratios obtained with XMM-Newton/RGS archival data. Similarly to the core of Perseus, we find that nine out of our 11 measured abundance ratios are formally consistent with the chemical composition of our Solar System. However, the (super-solar) N/Fe and (half-solar) Mg/Fe ratios significantly differ from Perseus and/or other systems, thus provide tension with the picture of a fully solar composition ubiquitous to all systems. In addition, possible uncertainties in O/Fe and Ne/Fe with atomic codes highlight the need for studying more systems at high spectral resolution to assess (or rule out) the universality of the ICM composition in clusters' cool cores. Combinations of (AGB+)SNcc+SNIa yield models can reproduce our observed X/Fe ratios in all cases. However, whether two distinct populations of SNIa are needed depends on the weight of our RGS measurements.

Stellar feedback, self-gravitating gas clumps and AGN energy injection account for most strong local perturbations, and large-scale gravitational asymmetries act as a scaffold for disequilibrium.

We conduct high-resolution $N$-body simulations of NSCs constructed based on observational parameters from two local dwarf galaxies: NGC205 and NGC404. For the first time, we achieve a star particle mass resolution of $1\\rm\\;M_{\\odot}$ and a BH mass resolution of $10\\rm\\;M_{\\odot}$. This level of resolution is crucial for accurately modeling the collisional dynamics of these dense systems. Including stellar-mass BHs within the stellar population significantly influences the IMBH binary dynamics, nearly doubling the sinking rate and halving the merger time. During the initial phase of the inspiral, the IMBH binary disrupts both the stellar and BH cusps. However, the BH cusp quickly regains its steep slope due to its shorter relaxation time and continues to dominate the evolution of the IMBH binary, despite being much less massive compared to the stellar component. We uncover an interesting mechanism in which BHs first efficiently extract energy from the IMBH binary and then transfer this energy to the surrounding stars, allowing the BHs to spiral back toward the center of the system and restart the process. Our results imply that, although stellar mass BHs are a minor component of a stellar population, they can significantly facilitate IMBH growth within NSCs via mergers.

Innovative Mid-IR diagnostic diagrams highlight the role of the AGN as the main excitation source for the ionized gas in the entire MIRI field of view, consistent with optical diagnostics, and supporting the AGN-driven wind scenario. Density sensitive [NeV] and [ArV] Mid-IR transitions reveal high-density clumps (n_e > 10**4 cm**-3) along the edges of the jet and outflow, tracing gas compression by the expanding wind.

This kinematic dichotomy is confirmed by the photoionization analysis, which requires a dust-poor component dominating the optical lines and a dust-rich component responsible for the Mid-IR emission.

The most extensively studied star in this cluster is the B-type main-sequence S2 star (also known as S0-2). These types of stars are commonly found in binary systems in the Galactic field, but observations do not seem to detect a companion to S2. This absence may be attributed to observational biases or to a dynamically hostile environment caused by phenomena such as tidal disruption or mergers. Using a $N$-body code with first-order post-Newtonian corrections, we investigate whether S2 can host a stellar or planetary companion. We perform $10^{5}$ simulations adopting uniform distributions for the orbital elements of the companion. Our results show that companions may exist for orbital periods shorter than 100~days, eccentricities below 0.8, and across the full range of mutual inclinations. The number of surviving companions increases with shorter orbital periods, lower eccentricities, and nearly coplanar orbits.

The suppression magnitude depends on the difference in fluid velocities. In this limit, however, the interaction's drag dominates over the DE pressure support and causes the DE velocity to track that of the DM fluid at larger scales.

We show that the observed large Balmer decrements ($\\mathrm{H}α/\\mathrm{H}β$ and $\\mathrm{H}α/\\mathrm{H}γ$) naturally arise from Balmer resonance scattering without invoking dust. At sufficiently high densities ($n_\\mathrm{H} \\gtrsim 10^{{8}-{10}}~\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), the elevated multiple Balmer-line ratios converge to values that closely mimic dust reddening, explaining why LRD spectra resemble obscured AGNs. Furthermore, when the Balmer break and broad Balmer lines originate in the same dense gas, their strengths are physically linked, allowing us to constrain the density structure and infer a low broad-line region gas mass of $\\sim O(10~M_\\odot)$.

Our analysis focuses on the first pillar formed self-consistently in the simulation and is used as a proof of concept to test the applicability of the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF) method under conditions dominated by external agents. The pillar arises as the ionization front compresses a dense clump, producing a magnetically aligned, elongated structure whose morphology and field configuration closely resemble those observed in real systems such as the pillars of M16. Synthetic dust-polarization maps at 850 $μ$m reproduce the large-scale magnetic morphology of the simulated pillar, confirming that polarimetry is a reliable tracer of magnetic field geometry.

Our follow-up reveals clear [OIII] emission, ruling out a genuine zero-metallicity nature.

The sample consists of low-surface brightness (LSB) and ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) located inside 0.4 R$_{vir}$ of the Hydra I cluster. Integral field spectroscopy is acquired for 24 galaxies with the MUSE spectrograph mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Aims: Our main objective is to analyse possible correlations between the environment and the integrated stellar population properties. Methods: For each galaxy, we extract the 1D stacked spectrum in an aperture of one effective radius and adopt previously published stellar kinematics to derive age, metallicity and [Mg/Fe] through a full spectral fitting technique. Results: We find that the analysed LEWIS sample has a mean metallicity of [M/H] = -0.9 dex, a mean age of 10 Gyr, comparable to results of UDGs in other clusters. According to the projected phase-space, galaxies can be classified into two groups: early infallers, with slightly higher metallicities ([M/H]$_{early} = -0.8 \\pm 0.1$ dex), and late infallers, with slightly lower values ([M/H]$_{late} = -1.0 \\pm 0.1$ dex). Two types of galaxies are found in the early-infall region: half of them have metallicities consistent with the dwarf mass-metallicity relation, while the other half show higher values. Moreover, they display different timescales for stellar mass assembly. Conclusions: We identified different classes of UDGs in the Hydra I cluster, which suggest different formation mechanisms taking place.

Its construction, however, relies on the assumption of a universal extinction curve and on fixed values of the total-to-selective extinction ratio, Rv. Recent studies have shown that Rv varies significantly across the Milky Way and between different galaxies, raising concerns about systematic biases in Wesenheit magnitudes and period-Wesenheit relations. In this work, we discuss the impact of non-universal extinction on Wesenheit indices by combining the Rv-dependent extinction curve with a grid of stellar atmosphere models. We compute the integrated extinction in optical and near-infrared passbands, derive Rv-dependent R coefficients for multiple Wesenheit indices, and examine how changes in Rv propagate into Wesenheit magnitudes and Cepheid distances in our Galaxy. We find that the R coefficients in the Wesenheit functions vary strongly with Rv. For classical Cepheids in the Milky Way disk, variations of Rv within the typical observed range (2.6-3.6) can lead to substantial differences in the Wesenheit function, reaching +-0.7 mag from the mean for the Gaia-based Wesenheit index W_G and resulting in distance errors of almost 40%. Near-infrared Wesenheit indices are much less sensitive to Rv changes. Our results clearly show that accounting for variable Rv is essential when applying period-Wesenheit relations, particularly in the optical regime, or that near or mid infrared based distances should be used.

Comets, asteroids, planetesimals, free-floating planets and brown dwarfs, are continuously injected into the intra-cluster environment after expulsion from their host planetary systems or binary system. The dynamics of large populations of such free-floating comets (ffcs) in a star cluster environment is not yet fully understood. Aims. We investigate the dynamical evolution of comet populations in star clusters, and characterize the kinematics and ejection rates of ffc in a star cluster. Moreover, we determine whether a different initial energy distribution affects the mass segregation of the less massive population. Methods. We carry out simulations using the N-body code NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS (Flammini Dotti et al. 2025), which allows fast integration of star clusters that contain large numbers of massless particles, to characterize the dynamics of populations of low-mass particles with sub-virial and super-virial distributions. Results. Comets do not participate in the mass segregation process, similarly to planet-size objects, regardless of their initial energy distribution. The latter is slightly changing the whole dynamical evolution at the start of the simulation. We only observe an initial relaxation or collapse of the objects for super-virial and sub-virial ratios, respectively. The external regions of the ffcs population tend to be pulled back in the cluster core at the end of the simulation, suggesting the gravitational pull of the stars is pulling them back in the core. This phenomenon occurs at later times if the system in virial equilibrium. Compared to less massive bodies, brown dwarfs experiences more mass segregation the inner regions tend to be more mixed with the stellar population", "AI": {"tldr": "研究发现自由漂浮彗星（ffcs）在星团中不发生质量分层（mass segregation），其初始能量分布仅轻微影响早期动力学演化，且外部区域彗星最终会被星团核心引力拉回。", "background": "研究聚焦于恒星团环境中自由漂浮彗星（ffcs）等低质量天体的动力学演化，探讨其初始能量分布对质量分层（mass segregation）的影响及运动学特征。", "data": "使用N-body代码NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS（Flammini Dotti等人2025年）进行模拟，该代码可快速集成包含大量无质量粒子的星团，以表征具有亚维里（sub-virial）和超维里（super-virial）分布的低质量粒子群体的动力学特性。", "method": "采用N体代码NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS（Flammini Dotti等人2025年）进行模拟，快速集成包含大量无质量粒子的星团，以表征具有亚维里（sub-virial）和超维里（super-virial）分布的低质量粒子群体的动力学特性。", "result": "彗星（ffcs）不参与质量分层（mass segregation）过程，与行星尺度天体类似，且不受初始能量分布影响。"}}
