We\nperformed Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi and Histogram of Relative Orientation\nanalyses tracing column densities 25.0 $<$ log($N$/m$^{-2}$) $<$ 27.2. With\nHRO, magnetic fields change from mostly parallel to column density structures\nto mostly perpendicular at a threshold $N_{\\rm crit}$ =\n(3.7$\\pm$0.6)$\\times$10$^{26}$ m$^{-2}$, indicating that gravitational forces\nexceed magnetic forces above this value. The same analysis in 10 individual\nclumps gives similar results, with the same clear trend in field alignments and\na threshold $N_{\\rm crit}$ = (1.9$^{+1.5}_{-0.8}$)$\\times$10$^{26}$ m$^{-2}$.\nIn the other 7 clumps, the alignment trend with $N$ is much flatter or even\nreversed, inconsistent with the usual HRO pattern. Instead, these clumps'\nfields reflect external environmental forces, such as from the nearby HII\nregion NGC 3324. DCF analysis reveals field strengths somewhat higher than\ntypical of nearby clouds, with the $Bn$ data lying mostly above the Crutcher\n(2012) relation. The mass:flux ratio $\\lambda$ across all clumps has a gaussian\ndistribution, with log$\\lambda_{\\rm DCF}$ = -0.75$\\pm$0.45 (mean$\\pm\\sigma$):\nonly small areas are dominated by gravity. However, a significant trend of\nrising log$\\lambda$ with falling $T_{\\rm dust}$ parallels Pitts et al's (2019)\nresult: $T_{\\rm dust}$ falls as $N_{\\rm H_2}$ rises towards clump centres.\nThus, in this massive clump sample, magnetic fields provide enough support\nagainst gravity to explain their overall low star formation rate."}

The cloud edge is outlined along the high-latitude\nside of the North Polar Spur, a prominent x-ray/radio structure. Our distance\nestimate utilizes 3D dust maps, the absorption of the soft X-ray background,\nand hot gas tracers such as O\\,{\\sc vi}; these place the cloud at a distance\nconsistent with the Local Bubble's surface.

These data are used\nto gain new insight into the growth of stellar mass across cosmic history by\ncharacterising the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) through\n$0.2 < z \\leq 6.5$. The total volume (0.62 Gpc$^{3}$) represents a tenfold\nincrease compared to previous works that have explored $z > 3$ and\nsignificantly reduces cosmic variance, yielding strong constraints on the\nabundance of massive galaxies. Results are generally consistent with the\nliterature but now provide firm estimates of number density where only upper\nlimits were previously available. Contrasting the GSMF with the dark matter\nhalo mass function suggests that massive galaxies ($M \\gtrsim10^{11}$\nM$_{\\odot}$) at $z > 3.5$ required integrated star-formation efficiencies of\n$M/(M_{\\rm h}f_{\\rm b}) \\gtrsim$ 0.25--0.5, in excess of the commonly-held view\nof ``universal peak efficiency\" from studies on the stellar-to-halo mass\nrelation (SHMR). Such increased efficiencies imply an evolving peak in the SHMR\nat $z > 3.5$ which can be maintained if feedback mechanisms from active\ngalactic nuclei and stellar processes are ineffective at early times. In\naddition, a significant fraction of the most massive quiescent galaxies are\nobserved to be in place already by $z\\sim 2.5$--3. The apparent lack in change\nof their number density by $z\\sim 0.2$ is consistent with relatively little\nmass growth from mergers. Utilising the unique volume, evidence for an\nenvironmental dependence of the galaxy stellar mass function is found all the\nway through $z\\sim 3.5$ for the first time, though a more careful\ncharacterisation of the density field is ultimately required for confirmation."}

A slower and\nwider (transversal size of about 750 au) component is probed by methanol, which\nis released from dust mantles at lower shock velocities (< 10 km/s). The SO and\nCS emission traces an intermediate component with respect to the components\nprobed by SiO and CH3OH. High spatial resolution imaging (down to 10 au) of the\njet of SVS13-B in multiple species will aid in reconstructing the chemistry of\nshocked material in protostellar jets."}

Yet these stars reach the zero age main sequence\n(ZAMS) with a spread in lithium abundance at a given effective temperature that\nis not predicted by standard stellar evolutionary models and which appears to\nbe correlated with rotation. Using a homogeneous dataset provided by the\nGaia-ESO spectroscopic survey, we have followed the evolving photospheric\nlithium content of cohorts of stars destined to be ZAMS late G-, K- and\nM-dwarfs, in clusters at ages of 2-300 Myr. We show that a dispersion in the\nLiI 6708A line strength develops in the lower mass stars after 10-20 Myr on the\nPMS, as soon as Li depletion begins, even in fully convective stars. A model\nbased on a surface starspot coverage varying from star-to-star, leading to a\ndifferential Li-burning rate, can explain this temporal behaviour and its mass\ndependence. However, to fully explain the magnitude of the Li dispersion and\nits correlation with rotation, the spot coverage during Li-burning would need\nto be a factor of two larger on average than measured in ZAMS clusters like the\nPleiades and continue increasing with rotation in PMS stars beyond the usual\n\"saturation limit\" observed for other magnetic activity indicators."}

To do so, we show that the perturbed geodesic equations must\ninclude anharmonic contributions arising from the higher-order expansion of the\neffective potential that cannot be neglected \\emph{a priori}, as commonly done\nin all the approaches pursued so far. More specifically, independently of the\nunderlying spacetime geometry, we find that in the radial sector the\nnon-negligible anharmonic correction is quadratic in the radial displacement,\ni.e. $\\propto \\delta r^2$, and significantly affects the radial epicyclic\nfrequency close to the innermost stable circular orbit. Conversely, polar\noscillations $\\delta \\theta$ remain approximately decoupled from radial ones,\npreserving their independent dynamical behavior. To show the need of anharmonic\ncorrections, we thus carry out Monte Carlo-Markov chain analyses on eight\nneutron star sources of quasi-periodic oscillations. Afterwards, we first work\nout the outcomes of the harmonic approximation in Schwarzschild,\nSchwarzschild--de Sitter, and Kerr spacetimes. Subsequently, we apply the\nanharmonic corrections to them and use it to fit the aforementioned neutron\nstar sources. Our findings indicate that the standard paradigm requires a\nsystematic generalization to include the leading anharmonic corrections that\nappear physically necessary, although still insufficient to fully account for\nthe observed phenomenology of quasi-periodic oscillations. Accordingly, we\nspeculate on possible refinements of the relativistic precession model, showing\nthe need to revise it at a fundamental level."}

In this context, we present an unsupervised machine learning approach\nto identify candidates for spectroscopic follow-up using data from the Southern\nPhotometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS). First, using an anomaly detection\ntechnique based on an autoencoder model, we select a large sample of objects\n($\\sim 19,000$) whose Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) is not well\nreconstructed by the model after training it on a well-behaved star sample.\nThen, we apply the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)\nalgorithm to the 66 color measurements from S-PLUS, complemented by information\nfrom the SIMBAD database, to identify stellar populations. Our analysis reveals\n69 carbon-rich star candidates that, based on their spatial and kinematic\ncharacteristics, may belong to the CH or Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP)\ncategories. Among these chemically peculiar candidates, we identify four as\nlikely carbon dwarf stars. We show that it is feasible to identify three\nprimary white dwarf (WD) populations: WDs with hydrogen-dominated atmospheres\n(DA), WDs with neutral helium-dominated atmospheres (DB), and the WDs main\nsequence binaries (WD + MS). Furthermore, by using eROSITA X-ray data, we also\nhighlight the identification of candidates for very active low-mass stars.\nFinally, we identified a large number of binary systems using the autoencoder\nmodel, but did not observe a clear association between the overdensities in the\nt-SNE map and their orbital properties."}
