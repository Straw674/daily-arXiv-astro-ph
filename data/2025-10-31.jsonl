Here, we perform the image\nstacking analysis of 217 LRDs in four NIRCam bands, representing the largest\nand homogeneous sample observed from COSMOS-Web survey to date. Our results\nreveal an unambiguous detection of faint extended emission in the F444W band,\nwith a typical size of ~200 parsecs and magnitude of ~27.7 AB at z~6.5. We\nperform four-band photometric SED fitting based on galaxy templates and derive\na stellar mass of 8.91+-~0.1 logM_sun. Given this stellar mass, the host galaxy\nis compact, i.e., ~2.5 times smaller than star-forming populations at similar\nmass, and the typical black hole mass of LRDs is elevated by ~1.5 dex above the\nlocal MBH-M* relation. This work provides direct observational evidence for the\nexistence of LRD host galaxies and offers crucial insights into the growth of\nthe host galaxy and the co-evolution of galaxies and their black holes within\nthe first billion years after the Big Bang."}

The polarized thermal emission from interstellar dust offers a\nvaluable tool for probing both the dust and the magnetic field in the\ninterstellar medium (ISM). However, existing observations only yield the total\namount of dust emission along the line of sight (LoS), with no information on\nits LoS distribution. Aims. We present a new method designed to give access to\nthe LoS distribution of the dust emission, both in terms of intensity and\npolarization. Methods. We relied on three kinematic gas tracers (HI, 12CO, and\n13CO emission lines) to identify the different clouds present along the LoS. We\ndecomposed the measured intensity of the dust emission, $I_d$, into separate\ncontributions from these clouds. We performed a similar decomposition of the\nmeasured Stokes parameters for linear polarization, $Q_d$ and $U_d$, to derive\nthe polarization parameters of the different clouds, and from this we inferred\nthe clouds' magnetic field orientations. Results. We applied our method to a\n$3~{\\rm deg}^2$ region of the sky, centered on $(l,b) =\n(139{\\deg}30',-3{\\deg}16')$ and exhibiting signs of star formation activity. We\nfound this region to be dominated by an extended and bright cloud with nearly\nhorizontal magnetic field, as expected from the nearly vertical polarization\nangles measured by Planck. More importantly, we detected the presence of two\nsmaller, depolarizing molecular clouds with very different magnetic field\norientations in the plane of the sky ($\\simeq 65{\\deg}$ and $\\simeq 45{\\deg}$\nfrom the horizontal). This is a novel and viable result, which cannot be\ndirectly read off the Planck polarization maps. Conclusions. The application of\nour method to the G139 region convincingly demonstrates the need to complement\n2D polarization maps with 3D kinematic information when looking for reliable\nestimates of magnetic field orientations."}

Using a\nsimple frequentist framework, it identifies structural changes in the\ndistance-sorted cumulative Mahalanobis distance of Stokes parameters (q and u)\nto detect the locations of dust layers and estimate their associated physical\nproperties (parallax and Stokes parameters) necessary to construct 3D maps.

The method assumes that the observed polarization arises from\ndiscrete, thin dust layers located at varying distances along the LOS. Using a\nsimple frequentist framework, it identifies structural changes in the\ndistance-sorted cumulative Mahalanobis distance of Stokes parameters (q and u)\nto detect the locations of dust layers and estimate their associated physical\nproperties (parallax and Stokes parameters) necessary to construct 3D maps. We\nbenchmark the method using mock datasets representative of\nhigh-Galactic-latitude regions, incorporating realistic Gaia parallax\nuncertainties and polarization expected from the upcoming Pasiphae survey.\nTests show that the method reliably recovers dust cloud distances and\npolarization properties when the polarization exceeds 0.1%, and the effective\nbackground-star fraction is greater than 10% in samples of about 345 stars. The\ndependence on background fraction decreases as the intrinsic polarization\namplitude of the dust field increases. We apply our method to existing\npolarization data from two illustrative sightlines, one at intermediate-high\nGalactic latitude and one near the Galactic plane, with known tomographic\nsolutions, finding excellent agreement with the literature and demonstrating\nits accuracy across both regions. Comparing with the BISP-1 approach, both\nmethods effectively recover dust cloud properties, but our approach is\nprior-free and computationally more efficient in determining the optimal number\nof clouds along the LOS. These advantages make it flexible and broadly\napplicable for multi-layer dust cloud reconstruction for the upcoming era of\nlarge-scale stellar polarization surveys."}

Here, we address this key unsolved\nissue with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE. In DECODE, we grow\ngalaxies with their SFR linked to halo accretion rate distributions via\nabundance matching. SMBHs are evolved following the stellar mass growth of\ntheir host galaxies by assigning an accretion rate at each redshift from the\nempirical Eddington ratio distributions and duty cycles.

Various\ndynamical diagnostics - including galaxy pairwise separations, velocity\ndispersions, and the offset of the first-ranked galaxy from the group\nbarycentre - indicate that single-BGG groups evolve more rapidly towards\nvirialisation than double- and especially non-BGG systems.

However, the spatial scales over which the initial\nconditions can exert a significant influence are not well constrained. We\nreport the first evidence for parsec-scale spatial correlations of stellar\nmagnetospheric inclinations ($i_{\\rm mag}$), observed in the Lupus low-mass\nstar forming region. Applying consensus clustering with a hierarchical\ndensity-based clustering algorithm, we demonstrate that the detected spatial\ndependencies are stable against perturbations by measurement uncertainties. The\n$i_{\\rm mag}$ correlation scales are on the order of ~3 pc, which aligns with\nthe typical scales of the Lupus molecular cloud filaments. Our results reveal a\nconnection between large-scale forces -- in the form of expanding shells from\nthe Upper Scorpius and Upper-Centaurus-Lupus regions -- and sub-au scale system\nconfigurations. We find that Lupus has a non-uniform $i_{\\rm mag}$ distribution\nand suggest that this results from the preferential elongation of protostellar\ncores along filamentary axes. Non-uniformity would have significant\nimplications for exoplanet occurrence rate calculations, so future work should\nexplore the longevity of these biases driven by the star-cloud connection."}

We show that at these stages, the full\nspectral energy distribution - X-ray spectra and UV/optical photometry - is\nwell described by a compact, yet standard accretion disk, the same disk which\npowers the X-rays at all times. By fitting up to three three epochs per source\nwith a fully relativistic disk model, we show that many system properties can\nbe reliably recovered, including importantly the black hole mass\n($M_{\\bullet}$). These accretion-based $M_{\\bullet}$ values, which in this\nsample span nearly three orders of magnitude, are consistent with galactic\nscaling relations but are significantly more precise (68\\% credible interval $\n< \\pm 0.3$ dex) and physically motivated. Expected accretion scaling relations\n(e.g., $L_{Bol}^{ disk} / L_{Edd} \\propto T_p^4 \\propto M_{\\bullet}^{-1}$),\nTDE-specific physics correlations ($L_{plat} \\propto M_{\\bullet}^{2/3}$ and\n$R_{out}/r_g \\propto M_{\\bullet}^{-2/3}$) and black hole-host galaxy\ncorrelations ($M_{\\bullet}$-$M_{\\star}$ and $M_{\\bullet}$-$\\sigma_{\\star}$)\nnaturally emerge from the data and, for the first time, are self-consistently\nextended into the intermediate-mass (IMBH, $M_{\\bullet} < 10^{5}$) regime. We\ndiscuss the implications of these results for TDE physics and modeling. We also\nreview and discuss different methods for $M_{\\bullet}$ inference in TDEs, and\nfind that approaches based on physical models of the early-time UV/optical\nemission are not able to recover (at a statistically significant level) black\nhole-host galaxy scalings."}
