At spectral type B1 II-III, $\\beta$ CMa is slightly hotter\nthan $\\epsilon$ CMa (B2 II-III), but its ionizing flux at Earth is attenuated\nby a much larger H I column density. At the external surface of the clouds, the\ntwo stars produce similar fluxes in the Lyman continuum (LyC). From the $\\beta$\nCMa angular diameter, bolometric flux, and position on the Hertzsprung-Russell\ndiagram, we obtain a consistent set of stellar parameters: $T_{\\rm eff} =\n25,180\\pm1120$ K, $\\log g = 3.70\\pm0.08$, radius $R = 8.44\\pm0.56\\,R_{\\odot}$,\nmass $M = 13\\pm1\\,M_{\\odot}$, and luminosity $L = 10^{4.41\\pm0.06}\\,\nL_{\\odot}$.

However, the\ngrowing number of spiral- and disk-hosted DRAGNs challenges this classical\ndichotomy. We present a study of the jet collimation profile for one such\nsource, 0313-192, using VLBA and VLA data, tracing the jet morphology across\nnearly five orders of magnitude in scale -- from $\\sim$ pc to $\\sim100$ kpc\n(projected). We find that the jet exhibits a parabolic expansion up to $\\sim\n610$ pc ($\\sim 7.9 \\times 10^6$ Schwarzschild radii), followed by a transition\nto a nearly conical shape, assuming kpc-scale emission primarily originates\nfrom the jet rather than the lobe. This structural evolution closely resembles\nthose in AGNs hosted by elliptical galaxies and provides an explanation for how\nthe jet in this system could extend to large distances by magnetohydrodynamic\ncollimation and acceleration. However, this collimation break occurs beyond the\nsphere of gravitational influence of the SMBH ($\\sim7.3\\times10^{5} R_{S}$),\nand no extended X-ray halos or dense molecular gas structures are detected to\nprovide the necessary external pressure. Therefore we suggest that jet\nconfinement in 0313-192 is mediated by contributions from non-thermal\ncomponents, such as ram and magnetic pressure from magnetized disk winds. These\nmechanisms may enable jet collimation even in the absence of dense ambient gas.\nOur results highlight how large-scale jets can arise in disk galaxies under\nrare conditions and demonstrate the need to broaden studies of AGN jet\nformation beyond traditional models."}

Using fiducial parameters\nunmodified from previous work, we expect about one observable Pop III galaxy\nsimilar to LAP1-B in the range $z=6-7$. At earlier times, the intrinsic\nabundance is higher, but Pop III systems would not have been detected because\nof their increased luminosity distance and lower mass dark matter halos, which\nwould host fewer stars.

Based on spectroscopic properties derived from our KCWI/KCRM\nintegral-field observation of super star clusters 1 and 2 (SSCs 1$\\&$2), we\npropose instead that these BH signatures originate from a luminous blue\nvariable (LBV) outburst in a binary system like $\\eta$ Carinae. First, the [Fe\nII] emission-line ratio and detected O I 8446 pumped emission require\nhigh-density gas ($n_e \\sim 10^6$ $\\rm{cm^{-3}}$). This dense gas resides in\nthe circumstellar medium (CSM) formed by pre-outburst stellar winds. Subsequent\nshock interaction between the LBV outburst ejecta and CSM efficiently produces\nwarm dust and the corresponding NIR excess. Second, SSCs 1$\\&$2 are\nnitrogen-enriched relative to other SSCs. This enrichment arises from ejections\nof CNO-cycled material by multiple LBV outbursts. Third, we detect asymmetric\nbroad H$\\alpha$ wings extending from $\\sim -5\\,000$ to $\\sim 10\\,000\\\n\\rm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. This asymmetry results from electron scattering in the\nexpanding, optically thick CSM. The proposed CSM shock interaction naturally\nexplains the luminosities of [Fe V] and ultra-luminous X-ray emission.\nContrarily, [Fe II] and [Fe IV] emission originates primarily from gas\nphotoionized by the cool primary LBV and hot secondary stars, respectively.

In pure\nthermal WDM models with the adiabatic initial condition, a combination of the\ndata from Lyman-$\\alpha$, gravitational lensing, and Milky Way satellites gives\na lower bound on the WDM mass as $6~{\\rm keV}$ at $95\\%$ C.L. while mixed\nWDM+CDM models loosen these bounds to $m_{\\rm WDM}\\sim1$ keV for a\nwarm-fraction $f_{\\rm WDM}\\lesssim0.14$ and $m_{\\rm WDM}\\sim600$ eV for $f_{\\rm\nWDM}\\lesssim0.08$.

With this large sample, we\nidentify a clear association between C$_2$H emission and the protostellar\noutflow cavity walls, and a consistent spatial anti-correlation between C$_2$H\nand SO emission. Together, these trends confirm that C$_2$H is tracing\nphotochemically active, O-poor gas in these younger sources. We fitted the\nC$_2$H spectra with a simple LTE model to yield column density maps, and find\nvalues ranging from 10$^{14}$ -- 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ in these sources. We also\nlooked for trends in the C$_2$H emission morphology as a function of various\nprotostellar evolutionary metrics, but find no clear patterns: the C$_2$H\nemission remains spatially extended in most sources, independent of age. This\nindicates that the transition to the compact C$_2$H emission observed on the\nsurface of Class II disks must happen rapidly, sometime just after the embedded\nstage."}

The redshift evolution of the\nSFMS at an averaging timescale of 10 Myr follows a relation, quantified by the\nspecific star-formation rates (sSFR$_{10}$), of\n$\\mathrm{sSFR}\\propto(1+z)^{\\mu}$ with $\\mu = 2.30^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$, in good\nagreement with theoretical predictions and the specific mass accretion rate of\ndark matter halos. We find that the SFMS normalisation varies in a complex way\nwith the SFR averaging timescale, reflecting the combined effects of bursty\nstar formation and rising star formation histories (SFHs).

Our findings suggest that bursty\nSFHs are more pronounced at lower stellar masses. Furthermore, we explore the\nimplications of our results for the observed over-abundance of UV-bright\ngalaxies at $z > 10$, concluding that additional mechanisms, such as top-heavy\ninitial mass functions, increased star-formation efficiencies, or increased\nburstiness in star formation are needed to explain these observations.

ArXiv abstract\n  is shortened", "summary": "The chemical composition of the inner regions of disks around young stars\nwill determine the properties of planets forming there. Many disk physical\nprocesses drive the chemical evolution, some of which depend on/correlate with\nthe stellar properties. We aim to explore the connection between stellar\nproperties and inner disk chemistry, using mid-infrared spectroscopy. We use\nJWST-MIRI observations of a large, diverse sample of sources to explore trends\nbetween C$_2$H$_2$ and H$_2$O. Additionally, we calculate the average spectrum\nfor the T Tauri ($M_{*}$$>$0.2 $M_{\\odot}$) and very low-mass star (VLMS,\n$M_{*}$$\\leq$0.2 $M_{\\odot}$) samples and use slab models to determine the\nproperties. We find a significant anti-correlation between the flux ratio of\nC$_2$H$_2$/H$_2$O and the stellar luminosity. Disks around VLMS have\nsignificantly higher $F_{\\rm{C_2H_2}}$/$F_{\\rm{H_2O}}$ flux ratios than their\nhigher-mass counterparts. We also explore trends with the strength of the 10\n$\\mu$m silicate feature, stellar accretion rate, and disk dust mass, all of\nwhich show correlations with the flux ratio, which may be related to processes\ndriving the carbon-enrichment in disks around VLMS, but also have degeneracies\nwith system properties. Slab model fits to the average spectra show that the\nVLMS H$_2$O emission is quite similar in temperature and column density to a\nwarm ($\\sim$600 K) H$_2$O component in the T Tauri spectrum, indicating that\nthe high C/O gas phase ratio in these disks is not due to oxygen depletion\nalone. Instead, the presence of many hydrocarbons, including some with high\ncolumn densities, points to carbon enhancement in the disks around VLMS. The\nobserved differences in the inner disk chemistry as a function of host\nproperties are likely to be accounted for by differences in the disk\ntemperatures, stellar radiation field, and the evolution of dust grains."}
