To extract this information, a method to\nseparate these effects and recover the initial shape of the MW's halo is\nrequired. Here, we use basis function expansions to analyze the halo response\nin eighteen simulations of MW-LMC-like interactions from the MWest\ncosmological, dark-matter-only zoom-in simulations. The results show that\nmergers similar to the LMC consistently generate a significant dipole and a\nsecondary quadrupole response in the halo. The dipole arises from the host\ndensity center displacement and halo distortions, and its amplitude scales as\nthe square of the MW-LMC mass ratio, peaking 0.2-0.7 Gyr after the LMC's\npericenter. The quadrupole's strength depends primarily on the original axis\nratios of the host halo, though contributions from the dynamical friction wake\ncause it to peak less than 0.3 Gyr before pericenter.

We present Astroflow, an\nend-to-end, GPU-accelerated pipeline for single-pulse detection in radio\ntime-frequency data. Built on a unified C++/CUDA core with a Python interface,\nAstroflow integrates RFI excision, incoherent dedispersion, dynamic-spectrum\ntiling, and a YOLO-based deep detector. Through vectorized memory access,\nshared-memory tiling, and OpenMP parallelism, it achieves 10x\nfaster-than-real-time processing on consumer GPUs for a typical 150 s,\n2048-channel observation, while preserving high sensitivity across a wide range\nof pulse widths and dispersion measures. These results establish the\nfeasibility of a fully integrated, GPU-accelerated single-pulse search stack,\ncapable of scaling to the data volumes expected from upcoming large-scale\nsurveys. Astroflow offers a reusable and deployable solution for real-time\ntransient discovery, and provides a framework that can be continuously refined\nwith new data and models."}

We present observational evidence that bars in high-density environments\nexhibit significantly slower rotation rates than bars in low-density\nenvironments. Galactic bars are central, extended structures composed of stars,\ndust and gas, present in approximately 30 to 70 per cent of luminous spiral\ngalaxies in the local Universe. Recent simulation studies have suggested that\nthe environment can influence the bar rotation rate, $R$, which is used to\nclassify bars as either fast ($1\\leq R \\leq1.4$) or slow ($R \\gt 1.4$). We use\nestimates of $R$ obtained with the Tremaine-Weinberg method applied to Integral\nField Unit spectroscopy from MaNGA and CALIFA. After cross-matching these with\nthe projected neighbour density, $\\log\\Sigma$, we retain 286 galaxies. The\nanalysis reveals that bars in high-density environments are significantly\nslower (median $R = 1.67^{+0.72}_{-0.42}$) compared to bars in low-density\nenvironments (median $R = 1.37^{+0.51}_{-0.34}$); Anderson-Darling\n$\\textit{p}$-value of $p_{\\mathrm{AD}}= 0.002$ ($3.1\\,\\sigma$). This study\nmarks the first empirical test of the hypothesis that fast bars are formed by\nglobal instabilities in isolated galaxies, while slow bars are triggered by\ntidal interactions in dense environments, in agreement with predictions from\nnumerous $\\textit{N}$-body simulations. Future studies would benefit from a\nlarger sample of galaxies with reliable Integral Field Unit data, required to\nmeasure bar rotation rates. Specifically, more data are necessary to study the\nenvironmental influence on bar formation within dense settings (i.e. groups,\nclusters and filaments)."}

We account for\nnon-perturbative effects, relevant during the initial stages of reheating,\nusing lattice simulations.

In particular, we restrict our\nanalysis to the osculating Barthel-Kropina geometry. The Kropina metric\nfunction is defined as the ratio of the square of a Riemannian metric $\\alpha$\nand of the one-form $\\beta$. In this framework we also consider the role of the\nconformal transformations of the metric, which allows to introduce a family of\nconformal Barthel-Kropina theories in an osculating geometry. The models\nobtained in this way are described by second order field equations, in the\npresence of an effective scalar field induced by the conformal factor. The\ngeneralized Friedmann equations of the model are obtained by adopting for the\nRiemannian metric $\\alpha$ the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker\nrepresentation. In order to close the cosmological field equations we assume a\nspecific relationship between the component of the one-form $\\beta$ and the\nconformal factor. With this assumption, the cosmological evolution is\ndetermined by the initial conditions of the scalar field and a single free\nparameter $\\gamma$ of the model. The conformal Barthel-Kropina cosmological\nmodels are compared against several observational datasets, including Cosmic\nChronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, which allows the determination of\n$\\gamma$.

The longer baseline improves the quality of astrometric fits, lowering\nthe noise floor and making consistently bad fits (for example, due to binarity)\nmore apparent. In this paper, we use simulated binaries from the Gaia Universe\nModel to examine the long-term astrometric behaviour of single stars and\nstellar binaries. We calculate nominal upper limits on the spread of goodness\nof astrometric fits for well-behaved single stars. Specifically, for the RUWE\nparameter, for upcoming DR4 ($\\rm RUWE_{lim}=1.15$) and DR5 ($\\rm\nRUWE_{lim}=1.11$), using the full mission nominal scanning law. These can be\nused to identify poor astrometric fits, and in particular can flag potential\nbinary systems. We show the increase in the number and type of binaries\ndetectable through RUWE. With our updated RUWE thresholds, the number of\ndetectable low-period binaries increases by 5-10% with each subsequent data\nrelease, suggesting detections may be possible for orbital periods down to\ndays. The number of detectable long-period systems increases by 10-20%, with\nperiods up to 100 years, causing significant deviations in low\nmoderate-eccentricity binaries. Very eccentric systems with much longer periods\n(thousands of years) can still be detected if they pass through periapse during\nthe observing window. Finally, we compare our results to the analytic estimate\nfor the spread in UWE, which we predict from a $\\chi$-distribution moderated by\nthe number of observations. These agree with our inferred population limits but\nsuggest that we may be biased by a small number of poorly sampled systems. In\nregions of the sky that are more frequently observed, lower limits could be\nemployed, potentially bringing even more binaries above the threshold for\ndetectability."}
