**TL;DR**: 通过高分辨率观测，研究Sagittarius B2云中22 GHz H2O脉泽的空间分布及其与HII区和原恒星核的关联，揭示了脉泽与物质流动的关系。

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Sagittarius B2云是天文学中一个重要的研究对象，但其内部的H2O脉泽分布和性质尚未完全明确。

Data: 使用Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array对22 GHz H2O脉泽线进行高分辨率观测，检测到499个脉泽。

Method: 分析脉泽的空间分布，并与HII区和原恒星核的目录进行交叉匹配。

Result: 62%的脉泽与原恒星核相关，32%与HII区相关；脉泽的空间分布揭示了与物质流动的关系，并发现脉泽亮度与连续谱流量无强相关性。

Abstract: We present high-resolution Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations of
the 22 GHz $\mathrm{H_2O}$ maser line in the extended Sagittarius B2 cloud. We
detect 499 $\mathrm{H_2O}$ masers across the observed velocities between -39
and 172 km s$^{-1}$. To investigate the nature of the masers, we analyze their
spatial distribution and cross-match with catalogs of HII regions and
protostellar cores. 62% of masers are associated with protostellar cores and
32% with HII regions. The nature of the remaining 6% of sources was not
established, but is likely associated with protostellar cores. Based on the
spatial extent of the groups of masers, we classify them as either
outflow-associated or young stellar object (YSO)-associated. We identify 144
unique sites of maser emission: 23 are associated with HII regions and 94 with
protostellar cores, of which 33 are associated with protostellar outflows and
18 with YSOs.
  The outflow-associated $\mathrm{H_2O}$ maser emission is confined to within
$<2000$ au of the central continuum source, despite shocked SiO emission
extending over tens of thousands of au. The YSO-associated masers show a lack
of detections at $5 < V_{rel} < 30$ km s$^{-1}$, which we suggest may be due to
maser self-absorption. We show how $\mathrm{H_2O}$ masers trace the large-scale
material flow in Sgr B2 N (North) also seen in SiO and mm continuum emission.
Finally, we find that protostellar cores with associated $\mathrm{H_2O}$ masers
tend to have brighter 3 mm continuum emission on average, although there is no
strong correlation between maser brightness and continuum flux.

### [2] [Bar-driven dispersal of Galactic substructure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09117)
*Adam M. Dillamore,Jason L. Sanders*

**TL;DR**: 本研究量化了银河系棒对子结构动力学的影响，发现棒显著增加了低能子结构的角动量和能量扩散，并提出了使用雅可比积分和化学丰度替代传统运动积分来寻找内晕子结构的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 银河系考古学家通常假设运动积分（如角动量Lz和能量E）是守恒的，因此子结构在运动积分空间中长时间保持冻结状态。然而，由于银河系旋转棒的存在，这一假设并不成立。

Data: 研究使用了三种理论模型：一个解析玩具模型、一组带有稳态和减速棒的测试粒子模拟，以及一个类似银河系的宇宙学放大模拟。

Method: 通过解析玩具模型、测试粒子模拟和宇宙学放大模拟，量化了棒对子结构动力学的影响，并推导了判断这种效应重要性的标准。

Result: 研究发现棒显著增加了低能子结构的角动量和能量扩散（约10-100倍），并提出了使用雅可比积分和化学丰度替代传统运动积分来寻找内晕子结构的新方法。此外，棒分散的子结构可用于约束棒模式速度的过去演化。

Abstract: Galactic archaeologists often assume that integrals of motion (IoMs) such as
$L_z$ and $E$ are conserved, so substructure remains frozen in IoM space over
many Gyr. However, this is not true in the Milky Way due in part to its
rotating bar. In this study we quantify the effects of the bar on the dynamics
of substructure. We employ three different theoretical models: an analytical
toy model; a set of test particle simulations with steady and slowing bars; and
a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy. Each model
predicts that the bar increases the angular momentum and energy spread of
low-energy substructures by a factor of $\sim10-100$, so they cannot remain
tightly clustered. We derive a criterion for determining when this effect is
important. The most affected orbits are low energy ($E\lesssim E_\odot$,
$r_\mathrm{apo}<40$ kpc), prograde, eccentric, or low inclination. This
includes $\sim3/4$ of Galactic globular clusters and $\sim1/4$ of known stellar
streams. We predict the presence of abundant bar-dispersed substructure. The
structures remain much more tightly clustered in the space of metallicity and
Jacobi integral $H_\mathrm{J}=E-\Omega_\mathrm{b}L_z$. We therefore propose
using $H_\mathrm{J}$ and chemistry instead of traditional IoMs when searching
for inner halo substructure. In $(L_z,E)$ space the dispersal of the structures
is along a principal direction with gradient $\mathrm{d}E/\mathrm{d}L_z$ equal
to the bar's pattern speed $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$. Bar-dispersed substructure
should therefore allow the past evolution of $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$ to be
constrained.

*Jessica E. Doppel,Mathilde Jauzac,David J. Lagattuta,Azadeh Fattahi,Guillaume Mahler*

**TL;DR**: 通过TNG50-1模拟研究发现，在星系群和星系团中普遍存在暗物质子晕，且质量较大的暗物质子晕倾向于远离星系团中心，未来搜索暗物质子晕应重点关注特定质量范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前基于ΛCDM范式的星系形成理论预测存在无发光对应体的暗物质晕和子晕，但关于这些天体是否可能包含微弱对应体仍是一个开放性问题。

Data: 使用了IllustrisTNG项目中的TNG50-1模拟数据。

Method: 基于TNG50的星系形成模型，结合有效表面亮度限制，分析了暗物质晕和子晕的分布特性。

Result: 研究发现，在星系群和星系团中普遍存在暗物质子晕，且质量较大的暗物质子晕倾向于远离星系团中心；特定质量范围的子晕更可能位于强透镜区域，建议未来搜索重点关注这一范围。

Abstract: Dark matter haloes and subhaloes that host no luminous counterpart are
predicted within our current understanding of galaxy formation within a
$\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Observational tests, such as gravitational lensing, have
made potential detections of such objects around individual galaxies as well as
in galaxy groups and clusters. The question of whether or not a dim counterpart
might reside in these objects remains an open question. We investigate this
point using the TNG50-1 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project. Under the
assumption of TNG50's galaxy formation model, we do not find haloes or
subhaloes above a total mass of $\rm 10^{9.7} \ M_{\odot}$ that are entirely
dark. However, under realistic effective surface brightness cuts of $\rm \leq
29 \ mag \ arcsec^{-2}$, the inference of the most massive dark subhalo in
galaxy groups and clusters becomes $\rm M_{DM} \gtrsim 2 \times 10^{10} \
M_{\odot}$. Concentrating on galaxy groups and clusters, we find that dark
subhaloes are ubiquitous with more massive dark subhaloes tending to
preferentially reside further from the centers of clusters. We find that
subhaloes in the mass range of $\rm 4.5 \times 10^{7} \leq M_{DM}/M_{\odot}
\leq 2.1\times 10^{8}$ tend to be the most likely to reside in the strong
lensing regions of galaxy groups and clusters, and argue that future dark
subhalo searches should investigate this mass range.

*Skylar Grayson,Evan Scannapieco,Johan Comparat,John A. ZuHone,Yi Zhang,Soumya Shreeram,Marcus Bruggen,Esra Bulbul*

**TL;DR**: 通过比较EAGLE和SIMBA宇宙学模拟生成的合成eROSITA观测数据与实际观测数据，研究发现SIMBA在匹配观测到的表面亮度分布方面表现优于EAGLE，但两种模拟均未在所有星系属性范围内与观测结果一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前宇宙学模拟依赖活动星系核（AGN）反馈来抑制恒星形成并匹配观测到的恒星质量分布，但AGN反馈模型缺乏约束。环星系介质（CGM）为研究这一过程提供了实验室，因为其金属丰度、温度和密度分布直接受AGN影响。eROSITA仪器的最新观测通过测量扩展的软X射线发射为这些分布提供了约束。

Data: 使用了EAGLE和SIMBA宇宙学模拟生成的合成eROSITA观测数据，并与按恒星质量、晕质量和恒星形成率堆叠的星系观测数据进行比较。

Method: 通过生成合成eROSITA观测数据并与实际观测数据进行比较，分析了CGM的X射线发射差异，并直接模拟了X射线双星（XRBs）的贡献。

Result: 研究发现SIMBA在匹配观测到的表面亮度分布方面表现优于EAGLE，但两种模拟均未在所有星系属性范围内与观测结果一致。CGM X射线发射的差异主要由R小于0.2 R200c处的密度差异以及更大半径处的温度和金属丰度变化驱动。热等离子体对CGM X射线亮度的贡献约为XRBs的20倍，但在M*小于10^11 M⊙时，XRBs的污染更为显著。

Abstract: Current cosmological simulations rely on active galactic nuclei (AGN)
feedback to quench star formation and match observed stellar mass
distributions, but models for AGN feedback are poorly constrained. The
circumgalactic medium (CGM) provides a helpful laboratory to study this
process, as its metallicity, temperature, and density distributions are
directly impacted by AGN. Recent observations from the eROSITA instrument
provide constraints on these distributions through measurements of extended
soft X-ray emission. Here, we generate synthetic eROSITA observations from the
EAGLE and SIMBA cosmological simulations, comparing them against observations
of galaxies stacked by stellar mass, halo mass, and star-formation rate. SIMBA
outperforms EAGLE in matching observed surface brightness profiles in general,
but neither simulation consistently agrees with observations across the full
range of galaxy properties we studied. We find that variations in CGM X-ray
emission between simulations are driven by density differences at $R \lesssim
0.2 R_{200c} $, and temperature and metallicity changes at larger radii. We
directly model predicted contributions from X-ray binaries (XRBs), finding that
the hot plasma contributes $\approx$ 20 times more to the CGM X-ray luminosity
than XRBs, except at $M_*<10^{11} M_\odot$, where the contamination from XRBs
becomes more significant.

### [5] [Constraining resolved extragalactic $R_{21}$ variation with well calibrated ALMA observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09125)
*Jakob den Brok,Elias K. Oakes,Adam K. Leroy,Eric W. Koch,Antonio Usero,Erik W. Rosolowsky,Frank Bigiel,Jiayi Sun,Hao He,Ashley T. Barnes,Yixian Cao,Fu-Heng Liang,Hsi-An Pan,Toshiki Saito,Sumit K. Sarbadhicary,Thomas G. Williams*

**TL;DR**: 本研究通过ALMA观测数据分析了14个邻近星系中CO(1-0)和CO(2-1)的线比变化，发现星系间线比变化较小（0.05 dex），且与恒星形成率表面密度等参数显著相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: CO(1-0)和CO(2-1)是常用的分子气体示踪剂，但以往研究因数据校准不确定性较大，难以准确确定线比变化。本研究旨在通过高分辨率ALMA数据填补这一空白。

Data: 使用了ALMA观测的14个邻近星系的CO(1-0)和CO(2-1)映射数据，其中包括12个星系的新ALMA (7m+TP) CO(1-0)数据。

Method: 通过比较CO(1-0)和CO(2-1)的线比（R21），分析其与星系全局性质、kpc尺度环境因素、恒星形成率表面密度和金属丰度的相关性。

Result: 研究发现星系间线比变化较小（0.05 dex），且R21与恒星形成率表面密度显著相关（幂律斜率0.10-0.11），表明在恒星形成星系样本中固定R21=0.64不会显著影响分子气体质量估计。

Abstract: CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) are commonly used as bulk molecular gas tracers. The CO
line ratios (especially CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) - $R_{21}$) vary within and among
galaxies, yet previous studies on $R_{21}$ and alike often rely on measurements
constructed by combining data from facilities with substantial relative
calibration uncertainties that have the same order as physical line ratio
variations. Hence robustly determining systematic $R_{21}$ variations is
challenging. Here, we compare CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) mapping data from ALMA for 14
nearby galaxies, at a common physical resolution of 1.7 kpc. Our dataset
includes new ALMA (7m+TP) CO(1-0) maps of 12 galaxies. We investigate $R_{21}$
variation to understand its dependence on global galaxy properties, kpc-scale
environmental factors, and its correlation with star formation rate (SFR)
surface density and metallicity. We find that the galaxy-to-galaxy scatter is
0.05 dex. This is lower than previous studies which reported over 0.1 dex
variation, likely reflecting significant flux calibration uncertainties in
single-dish surveys. Within individual galaxies, $R_{21}$ has a typical mean
value of ~0.64 and 0.1 dex variation, with an increase to ~0.75 towards
galactic centers. We find strong correlations between $R_{21}$ and various
galactic parameters, particularly SFR surface density, which shows a power-law
slope of 0.10-0.11 depending on the adopted binning/fitting methods. Our
findings suggest that, for studies covering main sequence galaxy samples,
assuming a fixed $R_{21}$=0.64 does not significantly bias kpc-scale molecular
gas mass estimates from CO(2-1). Instead, systematic uncertainties from flux
calibration and the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor account for more systematic
scatter of CO-derived molecular gas properties.

**TL;DR**: 该研究探讨了星系合并对宇宙中大质量星系形态和性质演化的影响，并分析了合并对恒星和黑洞质量增长的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 宇宙的演化受到引力吸引力的强烈影响，星系合并是其中的关键过程。研究旨在探索合并如何塑造大质量星系的性质。

Data: 研究使用了星系对的近距离观测、星系图像的视觉检查（如潮汐特征）以及形态参数（如不对称性和基尼系数）来识别合并事件。

Method: 通过观测方法识别合并星系，包括星系对的近距离分析、图像视觉检查和形态参数的应用。

Result: 研究发现星系合并比例随红移增加而上升，合并主要影响星系形态的演变，从高红移的旋转主导系统转变为近宇宙的弥散主导系统。合并还驱动气体向残余中心区域聚集，促进恒星形成和超大质量黑洞增长，但仅有约三分之一的恒星和黑洞质量直接归因于合并。

Abstract: The evolution of our Universe is strongly influenced by the attractive force
of gravity. A key aspect of this evolution, therefore, is the merging of
galaxies. Here, we explore the role of mergers in shaping the properties of
massive galaxies over cosmic time. Observational methods of finding mergers
include identifying galaxy pairs in close proximity, visual inspection of
galaxy images to identify signatures of mergers (e.g. tidal features) and using
morphological parameters such as Asymmetry and the Gini coefficient. The
fraction of merging galaxies increases with redshift, potentially out to z~6.
The principal impact of merging is to transform the morphological mix of
massive galaxies, from largely rotationally-supported systems at high redshift
to more dispersion-dominated systems in the nearby Universe. Mergers also drive
gas towards the central regions of the remnant, fuelling starbursts and feeding
supermassive black holes. However, only around a third of the stellar and black
hole mass at the present day is directly attributable to merging.

**TL;DR**: The study evaluates spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting as a robust method for identifying active galactic nuclei (AGN), comparing it with traditional methods and demonstrating its effectiveness in unifying multi-wavelength AGN selections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are typically identified through X-ray, radio, mid-infrared (MIR) colors, or emission lines, but each method captures different subsets of AGN due to limitations like signal-to-noise (SNR), redshift coverage, and extinction effects, highlighting the need for a multi-wavelength approach.

Data: The study uses optical-MIR SED fits from DESI Early Data Release galaxies.

Method: The study employs spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with CIGALE and compares it with traditional AGN identification methods such as BPT diagrams, WISE colors, X-ray, and radio diagnostics.

Result: SED fitting identifies approximately 70% of narrow/broad-line AGN and 87% of WISE-selected AGN, reducing contamination from star-forming galaxies. It also reveals AGN candidates initially undetected by standard methods, with further diagnostics classifying 85% of these sources as LINERs or retired galaxies with weak AGN activity.

Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are typically identified through their
distinctive X-ray or radio emissions, mid-infrared (MIR) colors, or emission
lines. However, each method captures different subsets of AGN due to
signal-to-noise (SNR) limitations, redshift coverage, and extinction effects,
underscoring the necessity for a multi-wavelength approach for comprehensive
AGN samples. This study explores the effectiveness of spectral energy
distribution (SED) fitting as a robust method for AGN identification.
  Using {\tt CIGALE} optical-MIR SED fits on DESI Early Data Release galaxies,
we compare SED-based AGN selection ({\tt AGNFRAC} $\geq0.1$) with traditional
methods including BPT diagrams, WISE colors, X-ray, and radio diagnostics.
  SED fitting identifies $\sim 70\%$ of narrow/broad-line AGN and 87\% of
WISE-selected AGN. Incorporating high SNR WISE photometry reduces star-forming
galaxy contamination from 62\% to 15\%. Initially, $\sim50\%$ of SED-AGN
candidates are undetected by standard methods, but additional diagnostics
classify $\sim85\%$ of these sources, revealing LINERs and retired galaxies
potentially representing evolved systems with weak AGN activity. Further
spectroscopic and multi-wavelength analysis will be essential to determine the
true AGN nature of these sources.
  SED fitting provides complementary AGN identification, unifying
multi-wavelength AGN selections. This approach enables more complete -- albeit
with some contamination -- AGN samples essential for upcoming large-scale
surveys where spectroscopic diagnostics may be limited.

**TL;DR**: 通过N体模拟和轨道频率分析，研究发现长寿命的恒星棒可以通过共振捕获显著重塑经典隆起，解释了其在局部宇宙中的稀缺性和银河系中经典隆起比例低的现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 经典隆起和恒星棒是盘星系中的常见特征，是星系演化的关键示踪物。棒共振处的角动量交换驱动盘内的长期形态变化，包括棒的减速和伸长，并影响伴随隆起的结构。

Data: 使用N体模拟和210个MaNGA盘星系样本的数据。

Method: 采用N体模拟和轨道频率分析来识别棒共振恒星群。

Result: 研究发现高达50%的初始隆起恒星被捕获在2:1共振轨道中，并表现出盘状运动学特征，导致经典隆起在观测上与盘难以区分；慢速棒（指示较老系统）更倾向于与较弱隆起相关。

Abstract: Classical bulges and stellar bars are common features in disk galaxies and
serve as key tracers of galactic evolution. Angular momentum exchange at bar
resonances drives secular morphological changes throughout the disk, including
bar slowing and lengthening, and affects the structure of accompanying bulges.
In this study, using a suite of N-body simulations, we quantify the secular
reconfiguration of classical bulges through resonant trapping by evolving
stellar bars. We use orbital frequency analysis to identify bar-resonant
populations and find that up to 50% of the initial bulge stars become trapped
in 2:1 resonant orbits and adopt disk-like kinematics. This transformation
renders much of the classical bulge observationally indistinguishable from the
disk. We compare these results with a sample of 210 MaNGA disk galaxies,
finding that slow bars--indicative of older systems--are preferentially
associated with weaker bulges. These results suggest that long-lived bars can
significantly reshape classical bulges, potentially explaining their scarcity
in the local universe and the low classical bulge fraction found in the Milky
Way.

Data: 使用了高分辨率宇宙学模拟数据。

Method: 通过高分辨率宇宙学模拟研究了超新星反馈、轨道运动环境效应和再电离效应对子晕恒星形成的影响。

Result: 研究发现，再电离效应是导致子晕缺乏恒星的主要原因，因为这些子晕初始形成于物质吸积效率较低的区域，无法自屏蔽紫外背景加热，从而阻止气体冷却至恒星形成阈值。

Abstract: The massive Local Group galaxies both host substantially fewer satellites
than the subhalos expected from the cold dark matter paradigm, and the recent
investigations have highlighted the interplay between baryons and dark matter.
We investigate the processes that make subhalos starless, using high-resolution
cosmological simulations. We found that the number of satellites around Milky
Way analogs closely aligns with observations, which accords with recent
studies. In our simulations, the majority of subhalos are devoid of stars,
i.e., "starless." We first examined supernova feedback and the environmental
effects associated with subhalos' orbital motion as candidates of origin.
However, neither seems to be the main driver. Supernova feedback causes a
reduction of cold gas in "starred" subhalos, but its impact is not significant.
In the case of starless subhalos, supernova feedback is irrelevant because most
of them do not have in-situ star formation in the first place. The orbital
motion in dense environments causes gas removal in all subhalos but is not
enough to remove pre-existing stars. The key is found to be the effect of
reionization instead. Starless subhalos are initially born in regions that are
less efficient in accreting matter. This makes them lack sufficiently dense gas
to self-shield from UV background heating, preventing their gas from cooling
below the star formation threshold. This indicates that starless subhalos are
not made but born.

**TL;DR**: 通过BRAHMA宇宙流体动力学模拟研究高红移宇宙中低质量黑洞种子的动力学行为，发现亚网格动态摩擦模型对黑洞合并率及早期生长具有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 高红移宇宙（红移大于5）中低质量黑洞种子的动力学行为及其合并机制是当前研究的重要课题，现有研究在黑洞定位和合并率预测方面存在不足。

Data: 使用[4.5 Mpc]³和[9 Mpc]³的BRAHMA宇宙流体动力学模拟数据，模拟形成质量为2.2×10³太阳质量的黑洞种子。

Method: 采用亚网格动态摩擦（DF）模型，并比较了允许黑洞自由移动的模拟，研究了黑洞在宿主子晕中的空间和速度偏移以及合并率。

Result: 亚网格DF模型显著影响黑洞合并率，合并时间滞后宿主子晕合并约100-1000百万年，合并主导早期黑洞生长，未来引力波观测有望约束种子机制。

Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of low-mass black hole (BH) seeds in the
high-redshift ($z\gtrsim5$) Universe using a suite of $[4.5~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$
and $[9~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ BRAHMA cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The
simulations form seeds with mass $M_{\mathrm{seed}}=2.2\times10^3~M_{\odot}$ in
halos that exceed critical thresholds of dense & metal-poor gas mass
($5-150~M_{\mathrm{seed}}$) and the halo mass ($1000-10000~M_{\mathrm{seed}}$).
While the initial BRAHMA boxes pinned the BHs to the halo centers, here we
implement a sub-grid dynamical friction (DF) model. We also compare simulations
where the BH is allowed to wander without the added DF. We investigate the
spatial and velocity offsets of BHs in their host subhalos, as well as BH
merger rates. We find that subgrid DF is crucial to ensure that a significant
fraction of BHs effectively sink to halo centers by $z\sim5$, thereby enabling
them to get gravitationally bound and merge with other BHs at separations close
to the spatial resolution ($\sim0.2-0.4~\rm kpc$) of the simulation. For the
BHs that merge, the associated merger time scales lag between
$\sim100-1000~\mathrm{Myr}$ after their host halos merge. Compared to
predictions using BH repositioning, the overall $z\gtrsim5$ BH merger rates
under subgrid DF decrease by a factor of $\sim4-10$. Under subgrid DF, the
different seed models predict merger rates between $\sim100-1000$ events per
year at $z\gtrsim5$. These mergers dominate early BH growth, assembling BHs up
to $\sim10^4-10^5~M_{\odot}$ by $z\sim5$, wherein $\lesssim2~\%$ of their mass
is assembled via gas accretion. Our results highlight the promise for
constraining seeding mechanisms using gravitational waves from future
facilities such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.

*R. Lallement*

**TL;DR**: 研究发现，两个z=7星系的紫外吸收峰uvB的光谱宽度wB和中心波长lB与银河系（MW）的值不同，揭示了与星际吸收带（DIBs）的关联，并支持了特定烃类分子存在的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 紫外吸收峰uvB的光谱宽度wB和中心波长lB在银河系中表现出一定的变化，但从未观测到如此窄的峰，且lB的变化性尚未被明确证实。最近的研究发现，hB和wB与某些星际吸收带（DIBs）的强度存在关联，这些关联仅限于sigma型DIBs。

Data: 使用了5780和6284 A的sigma型DIBs，以及5797和5850 A的zeta型DIBs。

Method: 通过比较银河系和高红移星系的uvB参数变化，研究了DIBs与uvB之间的联系。

Result: 研究发现，sigma型DIBs的丰度会导致lB向长波长方向移动和wB的减小，且银河系中lB和wB的变化范围约为高红移星系与银河系平均值差异的一半，支持了特定烃类分子存在的假设。

Abstract: The spectral width wB and the center wavelength lB of the UV absorption bump
uvB measured for two z=7 galaxies were found to differ from Milky Way (MW)
values. A decrease of wB by 45% and a positive shift of lB by 70-80 Ang were
measured. In the MW, the uvB amplitude hB and wB do vary; however, such a
narrow bump has never been observed and no variability of lB has been
convincingly found. Recently, links have been found between both hB and wB and
the strength of several Diffuse Interstellar absorption Bands (DIBs). They were
found to be limited to the sigma-type DIBs and their detection to be strongly
favored if the data were limited to monocloud-type lines-of-sight, selected
based on 3D dust maps. We extended the study of the links between MW DIBs and
uvB to the lB value and to the hB to continuum ratio, and compared MW
variations of the bump parameters to high z values. We used the 5780 and 6284 A
sigma, and 5797 and 5850 A zeta DIBs. Similarly to hB and wB, lB reacts to the
abundance of sigma carriers and is insensitive to the abundance of zeta DIB
carriers, which dominate in dense cloud cores. A strong abundance of sigma
carriers induces a shift of lB to longer wavelengths and a decrease of wB. The
MW lB and wB variability range is about half the difference between average MW
values and values in the distant galaxies. These results reinforce the
hypothesis of the existence of individual types of hydrocarbon molecules
responsible for both DIBs and part of the UV bump. They show that the majority
of species responsible for narrow and positively shifted bumps in distant
galaxies have a link with or are those producing the sigma DIBs and the
long-wavelength part of the bump in the MW, and that species producing the
short-wavelength part of the bump in the MW are of a different nature and
absent along the paths to regions of those distant galaxies that contribute
most to the UV emission.

### [12] [Deriving physical parameters of unresolved star clusters. IX. Sky background effects in the aperture photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09622)
*Karolis Daugevičius,Rima Stonkutė,Eimantas Kriščiūnas,Erikas Cicėnas,Vladas Vansevičius*

**TL;DR**: This study investigates the impact of sky background variations on the accuracy and applicability of the aperture photometry method for star cluster analysis in M 31, revealing selection biases and deriving mass limits for the cluster mass function.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The aperture photometry method is widely used for studying star clusters, but its accuracy is influenced by factors like the stellar initial mass function and sky background variations. Previous work established the method's limits in the local universe, but the effect of sky background remains unclear.

Data: The study uses a large sample of star cluster models from M 31 and background fields of varying stellar density from the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey.

Method: Simulated clusters were placed into different background fields from the PHAT survey, and aperture photometry was applied to measure their properties, determining age and mass limits.

Result: The study found that optimal aperture diameters are ~3 half-light radii for typical clusters and identified selection biases in the PHAT survey, with low-mass limits for the cluster mass function ranging from ~500 to ~3000 solar masses depending on the disc region.

Abstract: The aperture photometry method is a powerful tool that enables us to study
large star cluster systems efficiently. However, its accuracy depends on
various factors, including the stochasticity of the stellar initial mass
function and variations in the sky background. Previously, in the eighth paper
of this series, we established the best achievable limits of the aperture
photometry method for star cluster studies in the local universe. The aim of
this study is to determine how the sky background affects the limits and
applicability of the aperture photometry method in star cluster analysis. We
used a large sample of star cluster models spanning the parameter space of M 31
clusters. To determine how the background affects star cluster photometry, we
placed images of simulated clusters into five background fields of different
stellar density from the Panchromatic $Hubble$ Andromeda Treasury (PHAT) survey
and measured them using aperture photometry. We determined age and mass limits
for the M 31 disc star clusters at which photometric uncertainties are low
enough to enable the determination of cluster parameters using the aperture
photometry method. We demonstrated that for typical-size clusters, optimal
aperture diameters are of ~3 half-light radii. We assessed cluster detection
completeness in relation to varying sky background densities, based on the M 31
PHAT survey data. Our results suggest that a significant selection bias towards
more compact clusters may exist in the PHAT survey. We derived low-mass limits
of the cluster mass function (CMF) in the PHAT survey, reaching down to masses
of ~500 $M_\odot$ in outer disc areas, ~1500 $M_\odot$ in middle disc or
star-forming regions, and ~3000 $M_\odot$ in inner disc regions. Therefore, we
stress a necessity of careful accounting for selection effects arising due to
sky background variations when studying the CMF.

### [13] [A Metallicity Catalog of Very Metal-poor Main-sequence Turn-off and Red Giant Stars from LAMOST DR10](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09705)
*Xiangyu Li,Huiling Chen,Yang Huang,Huawei Zhang,Timothy C. Beers,Linxuan Zhu,Jifeng Liu*

**TL;DR**: A catalog of 8,440 candidate very metal-poor stars in the Milky Way was identified using LAMOST DR10 low-resolution spectra, with an empirical calibration method based on the Calcium Triplet lines, achieving reliable metallicity estimates down to [Fe/H] = -4.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The study addresses the identification of very metal-poor (VMP) stars in the Milky Way, leveraging the high signal-to-noise ratio in the red arm of LAMOST spectra to improve metallicity estimates.

Data: Low-resolution spectra from LAMOST DR10 were used to identify the candidate stars.

Method: An empirical calibration method based on the equivalent widths of the Calcium Triplet lines was employed to estimate metallicities, refined for more distant stars.

Result: The catalog includes 8,440 VMP candidates, with metallicity estimates showing a median offset of ~0.1 dex and a standard deviation of ~0.2 dex compared to other surveys and high-resolution observations.

Abstract: We present a catalog of 8,440 candidate very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H] < -2.0)
main-sequence turn-off (MSTO) and red giant stars in the Milky Way, identified
from low-resolution spectra in LAMOST DR10. More than 7,000 of these candidates
are brighter than G ~ 16, making them excellent targets for high-resolution
spectroscopic follow-up with 4-10 meter-class telescopes. Unlike most previous
studies, we employed an empirical calibration to estimate metallicities from
the equivalent widths (EWs) of the Calcium Triplet (CaT) lines, taking
advantage of the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the red arm of LAMOST
spectra. We further refined this calibration to improve its reliability for
more distant stars. This method enables robust identification of VMP candidates
with metallicities as low as [Fe/H] = -4.0 among both MSTO and red giant stars.
Comparisons with metal-poor samples from other spectroscopic surveys and
high-resolution follow-up observations confirm the accuracy of our estimates,
showing a typical median offset of ~0.1 dex and a standard deviation of ~0.2
dex.

Background: 银河系中存在一个可以通过运动学和元素丰度定义的薄盘，通常认为其由近似圆形轨道运动的恒星组成，但存在一些例外情况。

Data: 约70颗具有薄盘状元素丰度但运动学异常的恒星。

Method: 通过分析这些恒星的运动学和元素丰度特征，提出并评估了多种可能的形成机制。

Result: 研究发现每种恒星至少有一种机制是合理的，其中动力学喷射是最常见的机制，同时探讨了晕星具有薄盘丰度的可能性。

Abstract: The Milky Way is home to a thin disk that can be defined via kinematics
and/or elemental abundances. The elemental abundance-defined thin disk, also
called the low-alpha disk, is generally thought to be comprised of stars on
planar, circular orbits that approximate the circular velocity curve. While
this is an apt description for the majority of stars with thin-disk-like
abundances, there are a number of interesting exceptions. In this analysis, we
identify and investigate $\sim 70$ stars with thin-disk-like abundances and
very slow or retrograde Galactocentric azimuthal velocities. These stars could
be kinematical outliers of the thin disk or elemental abundance outliers of the
halo. Focusing first on the former, we introduce a number of mechanisms that
could alter a thin disk orbit and cause the azimuthal velocity to become slow
or retrograde. We then determine signatures for each mechanism and assess
whether that mechanism is unlikely, plausible, or consistent given each star's
reported properties. We find that at least one mechanism is plausible for each
star, and the mechanism with the highest number of consistent candidate stars
is dynamical ejection from stellar clusters. We next discuss scenarios that
could produce halo stars with thin disk abundances, and again identify stars
that could be connected to these mechanisms. With this sample we investigate
rare processes, such as binary disruption by the central supermassive black
hole, while also providing a unique perspective into the chemo-dynamics and
structural components of the Milky Way.

**TL;DR**: 提出了一种新的理论三维图方法，能够同时分离星系中的恒星形成、活动星系核和激波激发，并约束气体金属丰度、电离参数和气体压力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系中的激发源（如恒星形成、活动星系核和激波激发）经常混合在一起，而现有的分离方法要么应用范围有限，要么在区分活动星系核和激波激发时存在高度不确定性。

Data: 使用了甚大望远镜（VLT）/MUSE积分场光谱仪（IFU）数据和宽场光谱仪IFU数据，研究对象为NGC5728。

Method: 提出了一种理论三维图方法，能够同时分离恒星形成、活动星系核和激波激发，并约束气体金属丰度、电离参数和气体压力。

Result: 在NGC5728中发现了围绕星系中心的恒星形成环（半径约1千秒差距）、活动星系核电离双锥（延伸至约2千秒差距）以及激波主导的盘区，可能与核吸积盘或喷流-星际介质相互作用有关。

Abstract: The excitation sources in galaxies are frequently mixed due to AGN and
stellar feedback, including star formation, active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and
shock excitation. Disentangling the star formation, AGN, and shocks in galaxy
integral-field spectra (IFU) at optical wavelengths is crucial to expanding the
galaxy sample for AGN and stellar feedback studies, given the lack of
multiwavelength observations for most of the galaxies that are observed in
optical wavelengths. Previous methods to address this issue either have a
limited application range or are highly uncertain in separating AGN from shock
excitation (D'Agostino et al. 2019; Johnston et al. 2023). Here, we propose a
theoretical three-dimensional (3D) diagram. This theoretical 3D diagram
overcomes the limitations of previous methods and can simultaneously separate
star formation, AGNs, and shocks in active galaxies. Along with the separation,
the new theoretical 3D diagram also constrains the gas metallicity, ionization
parameter, and gas pressure within the galaxy. By applying the Very Large
Telescope (VLT)/MUSE IFU data and the Wide Field Spectrograph IFU data for
NGC5728 on the theoretical 3D diagram, we find a star-forming ring surrounding
the galaxy center with a projected radius of $\sim$1 kpc in the sky plane, an
AGN ionized-bicone extended up to $\sim$2 kpc from the nuclear center, and a
fast shock dominated disk region at the base of the AGN outflow, which is
likely associated with a nuclear accretion disk or a result of jet-ISM
interaction. The theoretical 3D diagram opens a new window to study the
interplay among star formation, AGN, and shocks in active galaxies.

**TL;DR**: 本文研究了波暗物质在宇宙结构中的干涉效应，特别是在密度奇点（如星系团中的反弹和星系合并中的潮汐壳）附近，发现干涉效应会导致密度分布出现由艾里函数描述的条纹模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 波暗物质由极轻粒子组成，其德布罗意波长超过粒子间的平均距离，导致典型的波暗物质晕中存在由波干涉引起的颗粒状子结构。密度奇点（如冷无碰撞系统中的反弹和潮汐壳）是研究波干涉效应的关键区域。

Data: 本文使用了数值模拟数据，其中引力势被精确计算。

Method: 研究通过近似引力势在近地点附近为线性，推导出密度分布由艾里函数描述的条纹模式，并通过数值模拟验证了这一预测。

Result: 研究发现波干涉效应在密度奇点附近产生显著的条纹模式，条纹间距显著大于基于系统速度色散的简单德布罗意尺度，这为探测不同质量的波暗物质提供了可能性。

Abstract: Wave dark matter is composed of particles sufficiently light that their de
Broglie wavelength exceeds the average inter-particle separation. A typical
wave dark matter halo exhibits granular substructures due to wave interference.
In this paper, we explore the wave interference effects around caustics. These
are locations of formally divergent density in cold collisionless systems.
Examples include splashback in galaxy clusters, and tidal shells in merging
galaxies, where the pile-up of dark matter close to apogee gives rise to
caustics. We show that wave interference modifies the density profile in the
vicinity of the caustics, giving rise to a fringe pattern well-described by the
Airy function. This follows from approximating the gravitational potential as
linear close to apogee. This prediction is verified in a series of numerical
simulations in which the gravitational potential is computed exactly. We
provide a formula expressing the fringe separation in terms of the wave dark
matter mass and halo parameters, which is useful for interpreting and stacking
data. The fringe separation near caustics can be significantly larger than the
naive de Broglie scale (the latter set by the system's velocity dispersion).
This opens up the possibility of detecting caustic fringes for a wide range of
wave dark matter masses.

**TL;DR**: 本研究通过分析NGC 7793星系中的X射线超新星遗迹（SNRs），利用Chandra和XMM-Newton的数据，新发现了四个X射线SNRs，并研究了其热光谱特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: X射线超新星遗迹在Local Group以外的星系中较为罕见，主要由于当前X射线仪器的灵敏度限制以及光学对应体的识别困难。研究这些遗迹对于理解其在不同演化阶段的反馈作用及星际介质具有重要意义。

Data: 研究使用了Chandra和XMM-Newton的X射线数据，总曝光时间为229.9 ks，覆盖19年的观测数据。

Method: 通过Chandra的高空间分辨率进行源检测和分析，结合XMM-Newton进行光谱分析，以识别与光学SNRs重合的X射线源。

Result: 检测到58个X射线源，其中5个与光学SNRs对应，包括4个新发现的X射线SNRs。光谱分析显示这些SNRs具有高温热光谱（超过250万K），并观察到密度、X射线亮度和源软度之间的相关性。

Abstract: This work focuses on the detection of X-ray Supernova Remnants (SNRs) in the
galaxy NGC 7793 and the study of their properties. X-ray SNRs in galaxies
beyond the Local Group are rare, mainly due to the limited sensitivity of
current X-ray instruments. Additionally, their identification requires an
optical counterpart, making incomplete optical identification methods an extra
challenge. Detecting X-ray SNRs in other galaxies is crucial for understanding
their feedback in different evolutionary phases and gaining insights into their
local interstellar medium. In NGC 7793, only one X-ray SNR was previously
known, while a recent study reported nearly 240 optical SNRs. The discovery of
a new, larger optical SNR sample motivated a re-examination of the X-ray SNR
population by comparing optical SNRs with X-ray sources. To identify X-ray
SNRs, we utilised Chandra's spatial resolution and analysed all available
archival data of NGC 7793, totaling 229.9 ks over 19 years. After data
reduction, we performed source detection and analysis, searching for X-ray
sources coinciding with optical SNRs. We also used XMM-Newton for spectral
analysis of the confirmed and candidate SNRs. We detected 58 X-ray sources down
to an observed luminosity of $\sim 1.5\times 10^{36}\, erg\, s^{-1}$. Among
them, five X-ray counterparts to optical SNRs were identified, all presenting
soft emission (<1.2 keV) with no short- or long-term variability. One
corresponds to the previously known X-ray SNR, while four are newly detected.
Spectral modeling of two SNRs shows thermal spectra exceeding 2.5 million K,
with strong OVII, OVIII, and NeIX emission lines. A correlation between
density, X-ray luminosity, and source softness was observed. We also report
X-ray emission from supernova 2008bk, refining its position, and suggest two
candidate X-ray SNRs with soft, non-variable spectra, one resembling the
identified X-ray SNRs.

Background: 当前研究领域关注引力波驱动状态下偏心双星系统的动力学行为，但现有模型通常采用简化的功率律描述环境效应，未能充分反映实际物理过程。

Data: 研究使用了分析计算、数值实验和一组精选的流体动力学模拟数据。

Method: 通过系统推导引力波信号的相位漂移模型，结合分析计算、数值实验和流体动力学模拟，研究了共振效应的影响。

Result: 研究发现，在探测器波段内保留轻微偏心率的引力波信号中，星体运动共振引起的相位漂移主导了基于平滑或轨道平均气体拖曳模型的预期结果。

Abstract: We model the effect of resonances between time-varying perturbative forces
and the epi-cyclical motion of eccentric binaries in the gravitational wave
(GW) driven regime. These induce secular drifts in the orbital elements which
are reflected in a dephasing of the binary's GW signal, derived here
systematically. The resulting dephasing prescriptions showcase a much richer
phenomenology with respect to typically adopted power-laws, and are better able
to model realistic environmental effects (EE). The most important consequences
are for gas embedded binaries, which we analyse in detail with a series of
analytical calculations, numerical experiments and a curated set of
hydrodynamical simulations. Even in these simplified tests, we find the
surprising result that dephasing caused by epi-cyclical resonances dominate
over expectations based on smoothed or orbit averaged gas drag models in GW
signals that retain mild eccentricity in the detector band ($e> 0.05$). We
discuss how dissecting GW dephasing in its component Fourier modes can be used
to probe the coupling of binaries with their surrounding environment in
unprecedented detail.

Background: Seyfert-1星系NGC 3783中的高度电离外流是活跃星系核研究的重要课题，但此前缺乏对其详细表征的手段。XRISM的Resolve微热量计提供了高分辨率光谱，为研究这些外流的动力学和电离特性提供了新机会。

Data: XRISM的Resolve微热量计观测数据，包括6.4至7.8 keV范围内的Fe吸收线（Fe XVIII至Fe XXVI）以及Si、S和Ar的吸收特征。

Method: 光谱分析和光致电离建模，结合时间平均的Resolve光谱数据。

Result: 研究发现六种外流成分，其中五种具有较窄吸收线，外流速度范围为560至1170 km/s；另一种为宽吸收特征，对应Fe XXVI外流速度达14,300 km/s（0.05c）。此外，外流的湍流速度随电离参数增加而增加，柱密度在log ξ=3.2后出现复杂变化，表明电离结构复杂。结果支持外流具有多起源和驱动机制的“混合风”模型。

Abstract: We present our study of the XRISM observation of the Seyfert-1 galaxy NGC
3783. For the first time, XRISM's Resolve microcalorimeter enables a detailed
characterization of the highly ionized outflows in this active galactic
nucleus. Our analysis constrains their outflow and turbulent velocities, along
with their ionization parameter $\xi$ and column density $N_{\rm H}$. The
high-resolution Resolve spectrum reveals a distinct series of Fe absorption
lines between 6.4 and 7.8 keV, ranging from Fe XVIII to Fe XXVI. At lower
energies, absorption features from Si, S, and Ar are also detected. Our
spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of the time-averaged Resolve spectrum
uncover six outflow components, five of which exhibit relatively narrow
absorption lines, with outflow velocities ranging from 560 to 1170 km/s. In
addition, a broad absorption feature is detected, which is consistent with Fe
XXVI outflowing at 14,300 km/s (0.05 $c$). This component carries a kinetic
luminosity of 0.8-3% of the bolometric luminosity. Our analysis of the Resolve
spectrum shows that more highly ionized absorption lines are intrinsically
broader than those of lower ionization species, indicating that the turbulent
velocity of the six outflow components (ranging from 0 to 3500 km/s) increases
with $\xi$. Furthermore, we find that the $N_{\rm H}$ of the outflows generally
declines with $\xi$ up to $\log \xi = 3.2$, but rises beyond this point,
suggesting a complex ionization structure. Examination of the absorption
profile of the Fe XXV resonance line reveals intriguing similarities to UV
absorption lines (Ly$\alpha$ and C IV) observed by the HST, from which we infer
that the outflows are clumpy in nature. Our XRISM/Resolve results support a
'hybrid wind' scenario, in which the outflows have multiple origins and driving
mechanisms. We explore various interpretations of our findings within AGN wind
models.

Background: 目前对星系团内X射线源的研究仍不充分，Antlia星系团的观测为理解这类源的普遍性和起源提供了新数据。

Data: 使用钱德拉观测数据，包含202个X射线源的坐标、多波段流量信息和硬度比。

Method: 系统调查Antlia星系团内200千秒差距区域的X射线源，检测下限为0.5-8 keV波段4.2×10^-7 ph cm^-2 s^-1（2×10^38 erg s^-1）。

Result: 发现37.6个超出背景的X射线源，可能与星系团内光相关；这些源在包含BCG的区域内数量增加，表明与BCG的潜在联系。此外，ICL-LMXBs、GC-LMXBs和SN-kicked LMXBs可能分别贡献约30%的超额源。

Abstract: We conduct a systematic survey of X-ray sources in the inner ($r\sim200$ kpc)
region of the Antlia cluster based on \Chandra observations, down to a source
detection limit of $ L(0.5\text{--}8\ \mathrm{keV})\sim4.2\times10^{-7}\
\mathrm{ph\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}}$ ($2\times10^{38}\ \mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}}$). We
present an X-ray source catalog with 202 sources and provide their coordinates,
multi-band flux information and hardness ratios. We find a statistically
significant excess at a significance level of $4.2\sigma$ with 37.6 excess
sources beyond three times the mean effective radius of the two BCGs. This
implies that these excess sources could be a genuine intracluster X-ray
population that is not associated with the bulk stellar component. Also, the
increased number of excess sources in the fields containing a BCG implies a
potential connection between the excess sources and BCGs. The discovery of
these sources in the Antlia cluster, together with previous research of similar
findings in other two nearby clusters, Virgo and Fornax, indicates that the
intracluster X-ray population could be universal in nearby galaxy clusters.
Furthermore, we discuss the candidate origins of the excess sources, including
low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) associated with intracluster light (ICL-LMXBs),
LMXBs in globular clusters (GC-LMXBs) and supernova-kicked LMXBs (SN-kicked
LMXBs). We estimate the contribution of ICL-LMXBs, which should include the
LMXBs relating with the stellar halo surrounding BCGs, are unlikely to dominate
the intracluster X-ray population in Antlia. Meanwhile, GC-LMXBs and SN-kicked
LMXBs, each component could contribute $\sim30\%$ to the total excess sources.
