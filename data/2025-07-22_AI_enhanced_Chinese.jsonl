Here we study the turbulence in these protoclusters with\nC18O (2-1) emission line using the sonic Mach number analysis (M_s ) and the\nsize-linewidth relation. The probability distribution functions (PDFs) for M_s\nshow a similar pattern, exhibiting no clear trend associated with evolutionary\nstage, peaking in the range between 4 and 7, and then extending to ~ 25. Such\nvalues of M_s indicate that the turbulence in the density regime traced by the\nC18O line inside the protoclusters is supersonic in nature.

Submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics. Comments\n  are welcome", "summary": "Context. The origin and nature of spiral arms remain unclear. Star forming\nregions and young stars are generally strongly associated to the spiral\nstructure, but there are few quantitative predictions from simulations about\nthe involvement of stars of different ages. Aims. We aim to quantify the\ninterplay between spiral arms and different populations. Methods. We use a\nhydrodynamical simulation of an isolated disc galaxy displaying a dynamic\nmulti-armed spiral structure. Inspired by cosmological structure metrics, we\ndevelop a new method, the local dimension, that robustly delineates arms across\npopulations and through space and time. Results. We find that all stars,\nincluding those as old as 11Gyr, support the arms. The spiral strength\ndecreases with stellar age up to 2Gyr-old stars and remains nearly constant for\nolder stars. However, the scaling between arm strength and age (or velocity\ndispersion) depends on the strength of the global spiral structure at each\ntime. Almost all stars formed in arms remain within them for no more than\n140-180Myr, whereas old stars leave arms about three times faster. Even if the\nyoungest populations dominate in the production of the spiral torques at early\ntimes, all populations contribute equally at later times. Conclusions. Our\nresults highlight the power of the local dimension for studying complex spiral\nstructures and show that all stellar populations in the disc partake in the\narms. Since in our model we see spiral arms in populations with velocity\ndispersions up to 90km/s, which are comparable to those of the Milky Way, we\npredict that old Galactic populations could also exhibit spiral structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "通过局部维度方法揭示所有年龄恒星（包括110亿年老星）均参与星系螺旋臂结构，且不同年龄恒星对螺旋强度的贡献随时间变化。", "background": "探讨星系螺旋臂起源及其与不同年龄恒星群体相互作用的动力学机制。", "data": "使用孤立盘星系的多臂螺旋结构流体动力学模拟数据。", "method": "采用局部维度方法分析动态多臂螺旋结构与不同恒星年龄群体的关联。", "result": "所有恒星（包括年龄达110亿年的老恒星）都参与支持旋臂结构，且旋臂强度随恒星年龄增长先降低后趋于稳定，同时不同年龄恒星对旋臂扭矩的贡献随时间变化。"}}

They account for about 56% of the sources listed in the\nrecent Fermi-LAT catalog (4FGL-DR4). The optical and UV spectra of BL Lacs are\nnearly featureless, making it difficult to precisely determine their redshifts.\nConsequently, nearly half of the {\\gamma}-ray BL Lacs lack reliable redshift\nmeasurements. This poses a major challenge, since redshift is crucial for\nstudying the cosmic evolution of the blazar population and {\\gamma}-ray\npropagation studies such as indirect evidence of EBL, placing constraints on\nIGMF and searches for LIV and ALPs. This paper is the fourth in a series\ndedicated to determining the redshift of a sample of blazars identified as key\ntargets for future observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory\n(CTAO). We performed Monte Carlo simulations to select {\\gamma}-ray blazars\ndetected by Fermi-LAT with hard spectra, that lack redshift measurements. These\nblazars are expected to be detectable by CTAO within 30 hours or less of\nexposure assuming an average flux state. In this fourth paper, we report the\nresults of detailed spectroscopic observations of 29 blazars using the ESO/VLT,\nKeck II, and SALT telescopes. Our analysis involved a thorough search for\nspectral lines in the spectra of each blazar, and when features of the host\ngalaxy were identified, we modeled its properties. We also compared the\nmagnitudes of the targets during the observations to their long-term light\ncurves. In the sample studied, 9 of 29 sources were observed with a high\nsignal-to-noise ratio (S/N > 100), while the remaining 20 were observed with a\nmoderate or low S/N.
