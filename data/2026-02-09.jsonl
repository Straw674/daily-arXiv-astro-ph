Recent RM campaigns yielded direct BH masses through dynamical modeling for a sample of 32 objects, spanning a wide range of AGN luminosities and BH masses. In addition, accurate BH masses have been determined by spatially resolving the broad-line region with GRAVITY for a handful of AGNs. Here, we present a detailed analysis of Hubble Space Telescope images using surface-brightness profile fitting with state-of-the-art programs. We derive AGN luminosity and host-galaxy properties, such as radii and luminosities for spheroid, disk, and bar (if present). The spheroid effective radii were used to measure stellar velocity dispersion from integral-field spectroscopy. Since the BH masses of our sample do not depend on any assumption of the virial factor needed in single-epoch spectroscopic mass estimates, we can show that the resulting scaling relations between the mass of the supermassive BHs and their host galaxies match those of quiescent galaxies, naturally extending to lower masses in these (predominantly) spiral galaxies. We find that the inner AGN orientation, as traced by the broad-line region inclination angle, is uncorrelated with the host-galaxy disk. Our sample has the most direct and accurate MBH measurements of any AGN sample and provides a fundamental local benchmark for studies of the evolution of massive black holes and their host galaxies across cosmic time."}

We build a simplified cluster evolutionary model in the $Λ$CDM framework to constrain the characteristic timescales of this transformation. In our model, field spirals joining the cluster are subject to ram-pressure stripping (RPS), which removes their gas reservoir leading to the quenching of their star formation on a timescale $t_{\\rm s}$, and to an (initially) unspecified mechanism that transforms them into S0s on a timescale $t_{\\rm m}$. We assume that $t_{\\rm s}$ and $t_{\\rm m}$ are independent and both power-law functions of $M_\\star/M_{\\rm cl}$, the galaxy-to-cluster mass ratio. We constrain our model using the observed distribution of spirals and S0s in a color-mass plane from the OmegaWINGS and EDisCS cluster surveys at $z\\simeq0.055$ and $z\\simeq0.7$. Our best-fit model reproduces the data remarkably well and predicts evolutionary trends for the main morphological fractions in agreement with previous studies. We find typical $t_{\\rm s}$ between $0.1$ and $1$ Gyr, compatible with previous estimates. A surprisingly strong anti-correlation between $t_{\\rm s}$ and $M_\\star/M_{\\rm cl}$ is required in order to suppress the formation of red, low-mass spirals at low redshift, which we interpret as driven by orbit anisotropy. Conversely, $t_{\\rm m}$ depends very weakly on $M_\\star/M_{\\rm cl}$ and has typical values of a few Gyr. The inferred morphological evolution is compatible with that resulting from the ageing of the stellar populations in galaxies abruptly quenched by ram pressure stripping: we confirm spectrophotometric ageing as a key channel for the spiral-to-S0 transition in galaxy clusters, with secular evolution playing a secondary role."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Some cosmological hydrodynamical simulations predict that outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) play a key role in powering the Ly$α$ nebulae observed around high-redshift quasars. In such simulations, AGN feedback seeded as powerful outflows leads to extended and luminous nebulae whose morphology and surface-brightness profiles accurately reproduce the observations, while suppressing AGN feedback leads to compact and faint nebulae. This link might arise from outflows opening up a channel for Ly$α$ photons to escape from the galactic nucleus to the circumgalactic medium (CGM). The main aim of this paper is to test this theoretical prediction using observations, by comparing the physical properties of outflows and Ly$α$ nebulae. We analyze integral-field unit data obtained with VLT/ERIS and GEMINI/GNIRS to trace the ionized gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) of a sample of six quasars at $z\\sim2-3$, using the [O III] emission line. We detect powerful outflows in all the quasars of our sample, with velocities $>1500~\\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ and kinetic energies $ \\gtrsim 2\\times10^{43}~\\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$. Four of our quasars are spatially resolved and show signs of extended [O III] emission out to distances $>2$ kpc from the central supermassive black hole. When excluding one outlier, we find a positive monotonic correlation between the outflow power and the Ly$α$ nebulae size ($ρ=0.89$, $p=0.03$) and luminosity ($ρ=0.6$, $p=0.28$). Additionally, we find evidence of spatial alignment between the ionization cone and the inner and brightest regions of the Ly$α$ nebula. Our results provide tentative evidence in support of the theoretical prediction that AGN-driven outflows at ISM scales open a low-optical-depth path for central Ly$α$ photons to reach the CGM and create extended nebulae."}

This `$J_\\varphi$-${\\overline{v}}_R$ wave' signal also exhibits a systematic phase shift when stars are binned by their dynamical temperatures. However, the origin of the wave is unknown. Here we use linear perturbation theory to derive a simple analytic formula for the $J_\\varphi$-$\\overline{v}_R$ signal that depends on the equilibrium properties of the Galaxy and the history of recent perturbations to it. The formula naturally explains the phase shift, but also predicts that different classes of perturbation should drive $J_\\varphi$-$\\overline{v}_R$ signals with very different morphologies. Ignoring the self-gravity of disk fluctuations, it suggests that neither a distant tidal kick (e.g., from the Sgr dwarf) nor a rigidly-rotating Galactic bar can produce a qualitatively correct $J_\\varphi$-$\\overline{v}_R$ wave signal. However, short-lived spiral arms can, and by performing an MCMC fit we identify a spiral perturbation that drives a $J_\\varphi$-${\\overline{v}}_R$ signal in reasonable agreement with the data. We verify the analytic formula with test particle simulations, finding it to be highly accurate when applied to dynamically cold stellar populations. More work is needed to deal with hotter orbits, and to incorporate the fluctuations' self-gravity and the role of interstellar gas."}

Accepted by PRD", "summary": "In the framework of Milgromian dynamics (MOND), galaxy clusters are known to exhibit a residual missing mass problem, with the baryonic mass falling short of the dynamical mass by about a factor of two. The baryon content of clusters is dominated by the intracluster medium (ICM), while the stellar contribution depends sensitively on the assumed stellar initial mass function (IMF). We re-evaluate the stellar and remnant masses in galaxy clusters by adopting the integrated galaxy-wide initial mass function (IGIMF) theory, which accounts for the dependence of the IMF on galaxy properties and star formation histories. Massive elliptical galaxies, characterized by high metallicities and short formation timescales, are inferred to form with top-heavy IMFs, leading to a substantial population of stellar remnants. Using observational data from WINGS and 2MASS for 46 nearby (z < 0.1) galaxy clusters, we compute stellar, remnant, and intracluster light masses and combine them with previously derived ICM masses. The resulting total baryonic masses are compared to MOND dynamical masses inferred from hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that the baryonic mass in stars, remnants and the ICM accounts for at least $88^{+5+2}_{-4-1}\\%$ of the MOND dynamical mass. This constrains the kick velocities of the remnants and substantially alleviates the missing mass problem for galaxy clusters in MOND."}

For drift-scanning arrays, robustly calibrating the data is especially challenging due to the lack of the ability to track a calibration source. Consequently, calibration strategies for drift-scanning arrays are limited by our knowledge of the radio sky at large, as well as the direction-dependent instrument response. In the context of 21 cm cosmology, where small calibration errors can conspire to overwhelm the cosmological signal, it is therefore crucially important to develop calibration strategies that are capable of accurately calibrating the data in the presence of sky or instrument modeling errors. In this paper we present CorrCal, a covariance-based calibration strategy for redundant radio interferometric arrays. CorrCal is a hybrid calibration strategy that leverages the strengths of traditional sky-based calibration and redundant calibration in a computationally efficient framework that is fairly insensitive to modeling errors. We find that the calibration errors from CorrCal are unbiased and far below typical thermal noise thresholds across a wide range of modeling error scenarios. We show that CorrCal is computationally efficient: our implementation is capable of evaluating the likelihood and its gradient in less than a second for 1,000-element class arrays using just a single laptop core. Given CorrCal's computational efficiency and robustness to modeling errors, we anticipate that it will serve as a useful tool in the analysis of radio interferometric data from current and next-generation experiments targeting the cosmological 21 cm signal."}

If one assumes such deviations to be real, a model-independent formalism (cosmography) is useful for locating the source of the problem with concordance cosmology. The extraordinarily good fit of LambdaCDM to the CMB data shows that it was a successful model of the universe at high redshift. Yet at lower redshift -- when the dark energy density becomes significant, and its precise physical nature becomes important -- the universe may have gone off the track of simple LambdaCDM. Here we use linear cosmography fits to binned Supernova data to reconstruct the detailed temporal history of the Hubble parameter, thus probing for interesting time-dependent behaviors of the expansion rate during and after the onset of cosmic acceleration. Using combined Type Ia supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey 5-Year data release and the Union2.1 compilation, we find intriguing hints of an oscillatory pattern in the Hubble parameter during the acceleration era. While these hints are low-significance, and not robust under different redshift binnings, we present this work as a proof-of-concept demonstration of this method for reconstructing the Hubble parameter evolution, which may be useful for the voluminous Supernova data sets anticipated to become available during the next few years."}

A central contribution of this work is the demonstration that this long-standing inference problem can be solved using an exceptionally simple machine-learning model: a fully connected, feed-forward artificial neural network with a single hidden layer. The network is trained exclusively on synthetic galaxies generated by the SHARK semi-analytic model and is shown to transfer effectively to real observations. Across nearly 3.5 dex in stellar mass, the predicted values closely track the GAMA SED-derived masses, with a typical scatter of ~0.131 dex. These results demonstrate that complex deep-learning architectures are not a prerequisite for robust stellar mass estimation, and that simulation-trained, lightweight machine-learning models can capture the dominant physical information encoded in broad-band photometry. The method is further applied to 17,006 GAMA galaxies lacking SED-derived masses, with photometric uncertainties propagated through the network to provide corresponding error estimates on the inferred stellar masses. Overall, this work establishes a computationally efficient and conceptually transparent pathway for simulation-to-observation transfer learning in galaxy evolution studies."}

The major results are summarized in the first three figures. We quantify model preference with Bayesian evidence and assess consistency with complementary evidence- and likelihood-based diagnostics applied uniformly across data-set combinations. For the models considered, updated Planck processing systematically improves internal CMB consistency (low-$\\ell$ versus high-$\\ell$, and primary CMB versus CMB lensing). The preference for a closed geometry and an associated ``curvature tension'' with BAO and/or CMB lensing are largely confined to earlier Planck likelihood implementations and weaken substantially when using updated CMB processing and more recent BAO measurements. Apparent evidence for evolving dark energy in CMB+BAO+SN combinations depends sensitively on the specific pairing of CMB and SN likelihoods: plausible alternatives shift inferred tensions by more than $1\\,σ$ and can completely reverse the preferred model. Allowing a free neutrino mass tends to absorb residual shifts without introducing new inconsistencies, and we do not find robust evidence for a standalone $τ$-driven discrepancy once the full likelihood context is accounted for. We conclude that claims of a required update of our standard cosmological model from LCDM to $w_0w_a$CDM are premature."}

Studies on optical/digital systems have shown that jointly optimizing the whole system is a better alternative. We propose to extend these co-design strategies to the design of an adaptive optics-assisted imaging system. We derive a simple criterion that takes into account the source properties and the entire optical/ digital system performance. To illustrate its interest, we use it to optimize the wavelength distribution between the wavefront sensor and the imaging camera.

The realization of these computationally demanding simulations poses a crucial technical challenge. We present beyond - $Λ$CDM implementations of the Dynamic Zoom Simulations (DZS) method, a performance-enhancing technique tailored for large-scale simulations that produce lightcone-like outputs. This approach dynamically decreases the resolution of a simulation in the regions that are not in causal connection with the observer, saving computational resources without directly affecting the physical properties within the lightcone. We implemented the DZS algorithm in two state-of-the-art codes supporting non-standard cosmologies, namely modified $f(R)$ gravity in Arepo and dark sector interactions in Gadget4. We analyzed result accuracy and performance gains across resolution, simulation volume and model by comparing runs performed with and without the DZS algorithm. Our DZS reproduce the lightcone halo mass function, sky-projected massmaps, and matter and weak lensing convergence power spectra with an accuracy of $\\simeq$ 0.1% or higher in most cases.

We finally illustrate our findings by studying a physical model which, when equipped with the ability to smoothly change the absolute magnitude of Type Ia supernovae, partially resolves the Hubble tension."}

These measurements form the basis for solving the inverse problem of determining the cosmic ray anisotropy vector beyond the magnetosphere. To support such studies, periodic latitude measurements are necessary to determine the coupling functions of primary and secondary cosmic rays variations. The aim of this work is to develop and characterize a modernized standard neutron monitor based on a CHM-15 boron thermal neutron counter and a data acquisition system designed for marine expeditionary studies of cosmic ray variations. Modern nuclear physics experimental methods and the principles of microprocessor-based data acquisition systems were used to solve this problem. The results of test trials and of continuous monitoring showed that the characteristics of the upgraded and standard neutron monitor are similar, and the ease of use, compactness, and stability allow us to conclude that the mobile neutron detector can be used in expeditionary conditions with limited access for maintenance personnel."}

Following an object-oriented approach, the physical entities are modeled as processing objects connected to each other to exchange data objects. A simulation is run by providing its description instead of writing and executing a specific script. The Python language and its library flexibility allowed us to write one single code that can be run on CPU and GPU platforms. We put a strong focus on computational efficiency, relying on CuPy and its interface to access the CUDA-stream mechanism. Moreover, SPECULA is capable of distributed computations over multiple processing nodes, making it suitable to run in an HPC environment, as tested on the Italian supercomputer Leonardo. SPECULA can also be used in laboratory environment to implement a hybrid simulation, allowing us to interface simulated and concrete objects: this feature was demonstrated in the Adaptive Optics laboratories at Arcetri Observatory. In this paper, we describe the main characteristics of SPECULA, show some relevant examples of its use, and finally draw our goals for the future."}

This intrinsic X-ray weakness is considered a requirement for the formation of radiatively driven winds. To obtain an unbiased view on the connection between X-ray emission and the presence of powerful winds in the most luminous quasar phase, we present an X-ray analysis of a sample of extremely luminous, radio-quiet quasars with signatures of strong outflows in their rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) emission spectra. We study the $Chandra$ X-ray spectral properties of 10 objects, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16 quasar catalogue based on their UV luminosities and ${\\rm C}_{\\rm IV}$ emission line blueshifts, comparing them to typical optically blue quasars. Our analysis reveals that seven out of 10 quasars in our sample have photon indices $Γ>1.7$. Only two out of 10 objects exhibiting outflows with velocities exceeding 1400 km/s are X-ray 'weak', consistent with the fraction of X-ray 'weak' objects generally observed in quasar populations. Notably, one of the objects identified as X-ray 'weak' is likely an intrinsically X-ray 'normal' quasar that is heavily obscured. We observe a tentative indication at a $\\sim$2$σ$ confidence level that the correlation between the excessively low X-ray flux level and the presence of ${\\rm C}_{\\rm IV}$ emission-line outflows might emerge at wind velocities greater than 3000 km/s.

Accepted by PRD", "summary": "In the framework of Milgromian dynamics (MOND), galaxy clusters are known to exhibit a residual missing mass problem, with the baryonic mass falling short of the dynamical mass by about a factor of two. The baryon content of clusters is dominated by the intracluster medium (ICM), while the stellar contribution depends sensitively on the assumed stellar initial mass function (IMF). We re-evaluate the stellar and remnant masses in galaxy clusters by adopting the integrated galaxy-wide initial mass function (IGIMF) theory, which accounts for the dependence of the IMF on galaxy properties and star formation histories. Massive elliptical galaxies, characterized by high metallicities and short formation timescales, are inferred to form with top-heavy IMFs, leading to a substantial population of stellar remnants. Using observational data from WINGS and 2MASS for 46 nearby (z < 0.1) galaxy clusters, we compute stellar, remnant, and intracluster light masses and combine them with previously derived ICM masses. The resulting total baryonic masses are compared to MOND dynamical masses inferred from hydrostatic equilibrium. We find that the baryonic mass in stars, remnants and the ICM accounts for at least $88^{+5+2}_{-4-1}\\%$ of the MOND dynamical mass. This constrains the kick velocities of the remnants and substantially alleviates the missing mass problem for galaxy clusters in MOND."}

Our analysis uses Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) W1 and W2 images of 83,345 candidate clusters at $0.5 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 1.9$ from the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2). The clusters are organized in stacks by redshift and signal-to-noise ($S\\slash N$) ratios.

We compare our splashback radii with the measurements made by K.

Our main systematic error is the accuracy of the background subtraction, but its impact remains small: the consistency of K. Thongkham et al. and our results suggests that neither method suffers from large systematics. The sensitivity of total light stacking to the contribution of faint galaxies can be advantageous to locate splashback radii when only the brightest galaxies are detected in individual images, such as at high redshifts.

Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) had been operating over the last 10 years, how many imminent impactors would it have observed and discovered pre-impact?'' We feed 216 large impacts detected by global coverage orbital sensors through the LSST Solar System Survey Simulator Sorcha, and find that it would have made 99 observations of 28 unique objects, and discovered one object four days pre-impact. Recently proposed pipeline modifications would increase this discovery number to seven. Scaling our results to take into account the biases of our reference population, we estimate that LSST will discover 12 +/- 3 imminent impactors over its nominal 10 year survey, with an average warning time of 3.5 days. While this is at the low end of previous estimates of 1 - 10 discoveries per year, the significant increase in warning time compared to the current average (9 hours across 11 impactors) will bring significant opportunities for follow-up telescopic observations, deployment of specialised equipment for fireball observations, and planetary defence operations. We also show that the LSST will provide substantial precovery data for impactors discovered by other surveys, instantly lengthening observation arcs and thereby reducing the orbital and impact location uncertainties. In some cases, these observations may also enable the linkage of telescopic observations with observed fireballs post-impact, providing valuable pre-impact astrometric and photometric data. This has significant implications for both asteroid research and planetary defence."}

The major results are summarized in the first three figures. We quantify model preference with Bayesian evidence and assess consistency with complementary evidence- and likelihood-based diagnostics applied uniformly across data-set combinations. For the models considered, updated Planck processing systematically improves internal CMB consistency (low-$\\ell$ versus high-$\\ell$, and primary CMB versus CMB lensing). The preference for a closed geometry and an associated ``curvature tension'' with BAO and/or CMB lensing are largely confined to earlier Planck likelihood implementations and weaken substantially when using updated CMB processing and more recent BAO measurements. Apparent evidence for evolving dark energy in CMB+BAO+SN combinations depends sensitively on the specific pairing of CMB and SN likelihoods: plausible alternatives shift inferred tensions by more than $1\\,σ$ and can completely reverse the preferred model. Allowing a free neutrino mass tends to absorb residual shifts without introducing new inconsistencies, and we do not find robust evidence for a standalone $τ$-driven discrepancy once the full likelihood context is accounted for.

We show that this universality arises from a single vertex function, the Cosmological Form Factor (CFF), which encodes the information on how long-wavelength modes modulate the SGWB statistics. Two fundamental principles -- statistical isotropy and locality -- uniquely determine the angular dependence of the CFF, resulting in a universal multipole scaling of the SGWB anisotropies. The CFF formalism provides a common language for classifying SGWB anisotropies and offers a powerful framework for interpreting upcoming observations."}

In this paper, we focus on measuring the abundance of interstellar iron and neon from the column densities observed in soft spectra from XMM-Newton and Chandra for various low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), which allows for a direct probe of elemental abundances. As a noble gas, neon will not deplete into solid form, thus providing a benchmark with abundances determined via UV spectroscopy. We find that, when assuming Fe is 90\\% depleted into grains, [Fe/Ne]$ = -0.523\\pm0.025$, [Fe/H]$ + 12 = 7.482\\pm0.016$, and [Ne/H]$ + 12 = 8.012\\pm0.022$, which are the tightest observational constraints on these abundances to date, while being consistent with literature which uses protosolar abundances. We also test how depletion into solid grains and scattering affect the results. The choice of depletion fraction can affect the abundance measurement by roughly $5\\%$, and that the inclusion of a scattering component can affect abundance measurements by $\\sim1-7\\%$."}

For each PBH mass, we compute the redshift-dependent energy injection from Hawking evaporation using \\texttt{BlackHawk}, fully accounting for the time evolution of the PBH mass and the complete spectrum of emitted Standard Model particles and gravitons. The resulting photons and electrons are propagated through the primordial plasma using \\texttt{DarkHistory}, which self-consistently models EM cascades and determines the fraction of injected energy deposited into ionization, excitation, and heating of the IGM. These modifications to the ionization and thermal histories are incorporated into a Gaussian Process reconstruction of the free-electron fraction based on low-$\\ell$ CMB polarization data from the \\textit{Planck} mission. This non-parametric approach allows for a statistically well-defined separation between exotic high-redshift energy injection and late-time astrophysical reionization, allowing PBH evaporation to be constrained through its contribution to the high-redshift optical depth. Requiring consistency with current CMB measurements, we obtain upper limits on the initial PBH abundance that are robust against reionization modeling uncertainties and systematically more conservative than existing bounds, reflecting the fully numerical and time-dependent treatment of Hawking evaporation and energy deposition. Our results demonstrate the power of reionization observables as a precision probe of PBH evaporation and other scenarios involving late-time energy injection."}

We also assess whether or not these biases are comparable to those introduced by assumptions made in atmospheric modelling, particularly in the treatment of aerosol extinction.\n  We perform nested-sampling Bayesian retrievals using MultiNest and forward models generated with the Planetary Spectrum Generator. Six independently reduced spectra are analysed, considering both the full wavelength range and versions excluding the saturated region. We further test the effect of including three different cloud-opacity parameterisations.\n  Differences among JWST/NIRSpec data-reduction pipelines lead to substantial variations in retrieved atmospheric properties of WASP-39b, often exceeding one order of magnitude, comparable to uncertainties from modelling assumptions. Excluding the saturated region reduces inter-pipeline dispersion but increases parameter degeneracies. This highlights the need for robust and homogeneous calibration strategies. The results also confirm that JWST data possess the sensitivity required to probe aerosol spectral behaviour, although such constraints remain strongly dependent on the adopted data-reduction strategy."}

Most emit primarily above 0.3 keV in X-rays, but cooler thermal sources peaking in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) would be much more difficult to detect due to astronomy's critical blind spot in EUV. Here, we report the discovery of a remarkable new class of luminous, point-like, non-nuclear X-ray objects in galaxies-hypersoft X-ray sources -- that have been missed by all previous surveys to date. Detected primarily or exclusively below 0.3 keV, with 0.15-0.3 keV to 0.3-1.0 keV photon ratios >8, the most luminous examples radiate >1E38 erg/s in the narrow X-ray band, with spectral models indicating even greater bolometric luminosities, largely emitted in the EUV. They rank among the most energetic sources in galaxies, yet their EUV-peaking spectra evaded earlier detections. We propose that hypersoft sources are X-ray binaries spanning multiple physical classes, including accreting white dwarfs or post-nova systems-potential Type Ia supernova progenitors-and systems hosting accreting black holes.

Accurate measurements of cluster's total masses are therefore essential, yet they can be challenging, particularly for clusters with complex morphologies, as simple mass profiles are often adopted to fit the measurements. In this work, we focus on the Frontier Fields galaxy clusters: a sample of six extremely massive systems, that, in most cases, exhibit highly complex mass distributions. The BUFFALO survey extended the Hubble Space Telescope observations for the Frontier Fields galaxy clusters, providing high-resolution multi-band imaging within a few Mpc. Combining this high-quality imaging dataset with ancillary spectroscopy, we produce weak-lensing catalogues with very high source densities, about 50 sources/arcmin$^2$. This allows us to robustly estimate the individual weak-lensing cluster masses and quantify the sensitivity of these measurements on different factors, such as the cluster centring, the uncertainty on the redshift distribution or the foreground contamination and boost factor correction. This provides a data-driven analysis of the different sources of systematics that can impact such measurements. We find that the largest sources of systematic bias arise for the most disturbed clusters, such as the multi-modal, merging galaxy cluster Abell 2744. This analysis sets a comprehensive framework for assessing the impact of systematics on the weak-lensing estimates of cluster masses, and in particular, in the case of unrelaxed clusters. This can play a key role in forthcoming cosmological analyses based on wide-field surveys such as Euclid and the Legacy Survey of Space and Time of the Rubin Observatory."}

Such angular jitter can be measured using the differential wavefront sensing technique, enabling the modeling and subtraction of TTL noise from the data. However, owing to the multiple degrees of freedom of the detector constellation, a linear TTL model requires at least 24 parameters, while a higher-fidelity quadratic model involves up to 60 coefficients, rendering parameter estimation computationally expensive. To accelerate parameter determination, we propose a modified parameter set obtained via a linear transformation of the original angular coupling coefficients, which effectively reduces correlations among TTL noise components. In addition, we perform parameter fitting using an alternative second-generation time-delay interferometry configuration, PD4L, rather than the fiducial Michelson configuration. These two improvements enhance the convergence speed of the fitting procedure by a factor of approximately 10 for the linear model and approximately 18 for the quadratic model. The proposed approach can therefore substantially improve the efficiency of TTL noise calibration in space-based gravitational-wave detectors."}

For drift-scanning arrays, robustly calibrating the data is especially challenging due to the lack of the ability to track a calibration source. Consequently, calibration strategies for drift-scanning arrays are limited by our knowledge of the radio sky at large, as well as the direction-dependent instrument response. In the context of 21 cm cosmology, where small calibration errors can conspire to overwhelm the cosmological signal, it is therefore crucially important to develop calibration strategies that are capable of accurately calibrating the data in the presence of sky or instrument modeling errors. In this paper we present CorrCal, a covariance-based calibration strategy for redundant radio interferometric arrays. CorrCal is a hybrid calibration strategy that leverages the strengths of traditional sky-based calibration and redundant calibration in a computationally efficient framework that is fairly insensitive to modeling errors. We find that the calibration errors from CorrCal are unbiased and far below typical thermal noise thresholds across a wide range of modeling error scenarios. We show that CorrCal is computationally efficient: our implementation is capable of evaluating the likelihood and its gradient in less than a second for 1,000-element class arrays using just a single laptop core. Given CorrCal's computational efficiency and robustness to modeling errors, we anticipate that it will serve as a useful tool in the analysis of radio interferometric data from current and next-generation experiments targeting the cosmological 21 cm signal."}

A vibrant ecosystem of visualization tools exists, catering to a wide variety of different needs. Real-time visualizations of numerical simulations offer scientists immediate feedback about the status of their simulations and can also be valuable educational and outreach tools. Developing a visualization tool with support for different operating systems, CPU/GPU architectures, and programming languages can be a challenge. It is common to use one or more graphics or UI libraries to act as abstraction layers and hide the underlying complexity. Whereas external libraries greatly simplify the initial programming effort, we argue that relying on them introduces new dependencies and problems, such as a higher entry barriers for new developers and users, and uncertainty regarding long-term support. In this paper we present a new approach for real time visualizations which we have implemented for the N-body package REBOUND. We propose to use a web browser to handle GPU accelerated rendering. This enables us to offer 3D, interactive visualizations on all major operating systems. What makes our new approach unique is that we achieve this without the need for any external libraries. We utilize WebAssembly to reuse existing OpenGL visualization code. Using communication via HTTP and a custom built-in web server, we are able to provide both local and remote real time visualizations. In addition to the browser based real time visualization, our approach offers other additional operating modes, including simulations running entirely within the browser, visualizations within jupyter notebooks, and traditional standalone visualizations using OpenGL. We focus on the implementation in REBOUND but the concepts and ideas discussed can be applied to many other areas in need of scientific and non-scientific real time visualizations."}

Our analysis uses Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) W1 and W2 images of 83,345 candidate clusters at $0.5 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 1.9$ from the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey 2 (MaDCoWS2). The clusters are organized in stacks by redshift and signal-to-noise ($S\\slash N$) ratios.

We compare our splashback radii with the measurements made by K. Thongkham et al. on a similar sample of MaDCoWS2 clusters using galaxy-cluster cross-correlation and find that they are consistent, although our method yields larger error bars. Our main systematic error is the accuracy of the background subtraction, but its impact remains small: the consistency of K. Thongkham et al. and our results suggests that neither method suffers from large systematics. The sensitivity of total light stacking to the contribution of faint galaxies can be advantageous to locate splashback radii when only the brightest galaxies are detected in individual images, such as at high redshifts.

This connection has led to the proposal that TDE host galaxies likely have gone through recent mergers. We conduct a new morphological study of 14 TDE host galaxies, using the r-band images from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), and Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), with the images from the latter two surveys having much higher depth and resolution than SDSS. We examine galaxy structures using conventional methods and also apply diagnostics of merger activity from machine learning models. Consistent with previous studies, our results show that TDE host galaxies are ~16% more centrally concentrated when compared to non-TDE-host controls. However, surprisingly, TDE hosts lack any indication of recent merger activity from both morphological analysis and our machine learning merger classifier. Instead, our results reveal that TDE host galaxies are approximately 1.5 to 2.5 times more likely to have bar-like or ring-like structures than their controls. This enhancement is even more prominent for TDEs in the green valley, with the factor reaching almost 3. Based on these results, we propose that bar-driven secular evolution, instead of merger, likely dominates the recent evolution of TDE hosts found in the green valley, which can simultaneously explain their distinctive nuclear properties and enhanced TDE rates."}

This study leverages data from Kepler, K2, and TESS, in conjunction with astrometric data from Gaia DR3 and spectroscopic constraints from APOGEE DR17 and GALAH DR3, to infer parameters for over 17,000 RGs. We use the code PARAM to homogeneously infer stellar properties considering in detail the sensitivity of our results to different choices of observational constraints. We focus on age estimation, identifying potentially unreliable age determinations, and highlight stars with unreliable $Δν$ measurements based on comparisons using Gaia luminosities. These are particularly relevant in K2 data due to the short duration of the observations of each campaign, and therefore important to characterise for Galactic archaeology studies where the spatial range of K2 is a benefit.

Unlike classical black holes, which inevitably culminate in central curvature singularities, our model demonstrates that the SS braneworld dynamics naturally regularize the interior geometry and prevent singularity formation. By solving the modified Einstein field equations induced on the brane, we obtain explicit interior, shell, and exterior solutions without invoking the idealized thin-shell approximation. The gravastar core is modeled as a Bose--Einstein condensate, while the intermediate shell consists of ultra-dense stiff matter. Bulk Weyl corrections induce anisotropic effective pressures on the brane, a feature that emerges intrinsically in this scenario and supports stability. We analyze the active gravitational mass, energy, entropy, and proper thickness of the shell, and establish the junction conditions at the interfaces. Our analysis reveals that the SS gravastar exhibits suppressed or even negative effective mass, reflecting the repulsive nature of the interior condensate, and admits stable equilibrium solutions consistent with energy conditions. This highlights the SS braneworld gravastar as a physically viable compact object and a compelling alternative to black holes. A key novelty of our construction is that the stabilizing pressure anisotropy and suppressed effective gravitational mass arise dynamically from higher-dimensional Weyl corrections, rather than being imposed through ad hoc matter sources or thin-shell idealizations. This provides the first fully analytic realization of a finite-thickness, stable gravastar in the Shtanov-Sahni braneworld, highlighting a genuinely geometric mechanism for singularity avoidance in compact objects."}

Constraining the contribution of thermal and non-thermal optical emission", "categories": ["astro-ph.HE", "astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "Accepted for publication in A&A. 10 pages (+5 pages of Appendix), 13 figures", "summary": "The quasar OP 313 was discovered in December 2023 in very-high-energy $γ$ rays above 100 GeV, enabling for the first time a complete characterization of its emission. However, the lack of updated measurements of its accretion disk, broad line region and dusty torus hampers a detailed interpretation of the role of accretion in the observed $γ$-ray production. We intend to characterize, during high-activity states, the external photon fields contributing to the IR-to-UV emission$-$namely dusty torus, broad line region and accretion disk$-$and investigate potential variability and blurring effects on the broad emission lines. We present new spectroscopic observations of OP 313 with the NOT and TNG telescopes to characterize its optical spectrum and variability with respect to archival observations from SDSS. We measure the luminosity of different broad emission lines, characterizing the broad line region, accretion disk and dusty torus. We measure the Mg II emission line, with an average flux of $F_{\\mathrm{Mg \\ II}} = (0.85 \\pm 0.11)\\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Its equivalent width and luminosity are consistent with a constant line with a variable non-thermal continuum. From the stable Mg II line we derive a constant luminosity of the thermal components, $\\log(L_{\\mathrm{BLR}} \\ \\mathrm{[erg \\ s^{-1}]}) = 44.91 \\pm 0.19$, $\\log(L_{\\mathrm{disk}} \\ \\mathrm{[erg \\ s^{-1}]}) = 45.91 \\pm 0.19$ and $\\log(L_{\\mathrm{torus}} \\ \\mathrm{[erg \\ s^{-1}]}) = 44.70 \\pm 0.16$, and estimated a BH mass of $\\log(M_{BH}/M_{\\odot})=8.36 \\pm 0.18$, in line with with that derived from the C III] line. These characteristics and the indicator of the accretion rate from the disk/Eddington luminosity ratio $λ=L_{AD}/L_{Edd} = 0.23 \\pm 0.10$, along with a high Compton dominance, favour a FSRQ-like nature, contrary to the argued changing-look nature."}

This interplay between parametric resonance and the misalignment mechanism shifts the predicted axion mass window for the observed dark matter abundance to $10^{-4}-10^{-3} \\, \\text{eV}$, displacing the canonical axion mass window to previously unexplored higher ranges."}

Comments welcome. Main arguments presented in Sections 1,2,5&6", "summary": "We revisit the spectral appearance of extended self-gravitating accretion disks around supermassive black holes. Using dust-poor opacity tables, we show that all optically thick disk solutions possess a universal outer effective temperature of $T_{\\rm eff}\\sim 4000-4500$K, closely resembling compact, high-redshift sources known as Little Red Dots (LRDs). Assuming the extended disk is primarily heated by stellar sources, this ``disk Hayashi limit\" fixes the dominant optical continuum temperature of the disk spectrum independent of accretion rate $\\dot{M}$, black hole mass $M_\\bullet$, and disk viscosity $α$, and removes the parameter-tuning required in previous disk interpretations of LRDs. We construct global self-gravitating accretion disk models with radially varying accretion rates, suggesting that burning of embedded stellar objects can both efficiently power the emission of the outer disk and hollow out the inner disk, strongly suppressing variable UV/X-ray associated with a standard quasar. The resulting disk emission is dominated by a luminous optical continuum while a separate, non-variable UV component arises from stellar populations on the nuclear to galaxy scale. We map the optimal region of parameter space for such systems and show that LRD-like appearances are guaranteed for $\\dot{M}/α\\gtrsim 0.1 M_\\odot /{\\rm yr}$, a threshold insensitive to $M_\\bullet$, below which the system may transition into classical non-self-gravitating AGN disks, potentially a later evolution stage. We expect this transition to be accompanied by the enhancement of metallicity and production of dust, giving rise to far infrared emission. This picture offers a physically motivated and quantitative framework connecting LRDs with AGNs and their associated nuclear stellar population."}
