The brane tension gives a residual geometric contribution to the vacuum energy, while the phonon sector is described by three scalar fields $φ^I$ and an invariant $b = \\sqrt{\\det B_{IJ}}$ entering an effective action $F(b)$. At the background level this reproduces a perfect fluid with energy density, pressure and bulk modulus set by two dimensionless parameters $\\varepsilon$ and $κ$. These parameters fix the enthalpy and bulk modulus in units of the space tension and determine the phonon sound speed through $c_s^2 = κ/\\varepsilon$. Dissipative effects are modeled by a bulk viscous pressure obeying a Maxwell type relaxation law with a characteristic time scale $τ(H)$ that depends on the Hubble rate. Motivated by a Boltzmann suppressed scattering rate at a mass-gap scale $H_\\star$, we adopt a simple ansatz for $Hτ(H)$ and obtain a compact expression for the effective dark energy equation of state $w_{\\rm eff}(H)$. The viscous correction is transient, is most active around $H \\sim H_\\star$ and drives a temporary phantom deviation. At the same time, we also show that $w_{\\rm eff}$ approaches $-1 + \\varepsilon$ at very early and very late times. Using a flat $Λ$CDM background for $H(z)$, we scan the parameter space and identify a region with $κ\\ \\simeq \\ \\varepsilon \\ \\simeq \\ 1/3$ and $H_\\star/H_0 \\ \\simeq \\ 2.1$. This choice gives an ultralight phonon with sound speed close to the causal limit and a viscous dark energy history $w_{\\rm eff}(z)$ that closely tracks a DESI motivated Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization over the redshift range most relevant for the DESI BAO measurements."}

This mapping does not modify the background expansion but encapsulates the leading contribution of inhomogeneous tidal fields to the accumulated Sachs redshift. We derive the implications for the luminosity distance, the low-redshift Hubble relation, and the directional dependence associated with local structure.

We used data from the first four SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Surveys and an archival Chandra observation to image the X-ray emission from Abell 1060.

The surface brightness and spectral analyses are also extended until 3$R_{200}$ and $R_{200}$, respectively, following a detailed cosmic X-ray background (CXB) analysis. Our fully corrected eROSITA image showcases a relaxed ICM morphology within $R_{500}$. We detect two weak ICM shocks with Mach number $M\\approx 1.5$ near the central galaxy NGC 3311 that coincide with diffuse radio emission along the line of sight. Furthermore, we detect multiple soft X-ray excesses with high spatial correlation with the 2D optical galaxy distribution beyond $R_{200}$. In particular, the excess in the north has a significance of $5.8σ$ above the local CXB level. This suggests that Abell 1060's outskirts are actively accreting baryons.

In this respect, we here explore a two-scalar field cosmological model, dubbed Chiral-Quintom paradigm, that allows for a unified description of early- and late-time cosmic accelerations, namely inflation and dark energy, respectively. Moreover, we show that it provides a mechanism to cross the phantom divide without instabilities. To do so, we first focus on scenarios where the scalar fields evolve under an exponential potential, leading to distinct cosmological behaviors, including tracking solutions and slow-roll or hyperbolic inflation. Afterwards, by considering a nonlinear potential and a mixing in the kinetic sector, we show that the model can also describe the matter-dominated era, offering a potential unification of the dark sector. Accordingly, we place bounds on this double-field paradigm by employing recent low-redshift observational data, including supernovae from the Pantheon+ and Union3.0 compilations, observational Hubble parameter measurements, and baryon acoustic oscillation data from the latest DESI release. By means of the Akaike information criterion, the standard $Λ$CDM scenario and the $w_0w_a$CDM model are thus compared with the Chiral-Quintom approach, showing that, in principle, multiple-field dynamics does not seem to be ruled out, ultimately providing a flexible framework for describing late-time dynamics."}

In the era of Stage IV surveys, contamination from galaxies below the detection threshold has emerged as a significant source of bias. Adopting a noise-bias-free machine-learning method to estimate shear, we quantify the impact of faint galaxies for a Euclid-like survey. In our baseline simulations, faint blends induce a multiplicative shear bias of -0.008, well above Euclid's requirement. Similar to previous studies, we find that calibration simulations must include neighbouring galaxies to AB apparent magnitudes as faint as 27.0 (+2.1, -0.9) and within approximately 1.0 (+0.2, -0.2) arcsec of each bright sample galaxy (BSG; the galaxy for which shear is measured). By varying faint galaxy properties, we identify which ones significantly affect shear biases and quantify how well they must be constrained. Crucially, we find that biases not only depend on the mean projected faint-galaxy density and apparent-magnitude distribution across the sample, but also on how these quantities vary with the observed brightness of the BSG. Furthermore, biases are sensitive to radial and tangential alignments and positional anisotropy of faint galaxies relative to BSGs. By contrast, shear coherence between BSGs and faint galaxies, parallel orientation alignments, and variations in the faint galaxy size-magnitude relation have negligible impact within the parameter ranges explored. Our results guide calibration simulations and highlight the critical role of deep observations in measuring the properties of faint galaxies."}

Using a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations, we study the evolution of isolated halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with massive PCs embedded at their centers, a scenario that could be realized in certain SIDM models with light mediators that predict a small-scale suppression of the linear matter power spectrum. We track the evolution of three equally concentrated $10^7\\,{\\rm{M}}_\\odot$ halos, hosting PCs of various total masses, and quantify how the presence of a PC affects the processes of core formation and collapse. Early in the core-formation phase, halos with more prominent PCs exhibit a delayed evolution by a factor of $\\sim 2$ due to smaller velocity dispersion gradients in the inner region. During most of the core-collapse phase, the halo evolution becomes closely aligned in physical time, with appropriate rescaling of densities, radii, and velocity dispersions. The scale densities and radii preserve the virial mass of the original halos, but with increased concentration. Deviations occur at the late phase of core-collapse at the level of $\\sim 5\\%$ relative to the reference collapse track of an NFW halo. These deviations depend non-trivially on both the increased concentration incurred by the PCs, as well as the velocity dispersion (temperature) of the outer halo regions, which can inhibit or enhance the heat transfer process.

The direct imaging method captures exoplanet light while minimizing light from the host star. This is conventionally achieved with a coronagraph, which allows detailed characterization of planetary atmospheres and features. The Photonic Lantern Nuller (PLN) is an innovative instrument designed for the direct detection of closely orbiting exoplanets within the inner working angle of standard coronagraphs. Unlike traditional coronagraphs, where the planet's signal is usually rotationally invariant, with the same point-spread-function at different position angles, and which also overlaps minimally with the residual stellar signal, data from a PLN consist of a one-dimensional collection of points that do not have rotational invariance and overlap significantly with the residual starlight arising from wavefront errors. Exploiting angular diversity to subtract these stellar residuals with the PLN thus requires adapting the Angular Differential Imaging (ADI) technique for use with non-rotationally invariant planet signals at close separations, where strong self-subtraction effects occur. We reformulate ADI using principal component analysis to develop a method to extract spatial parameters of exoplanets from simulated one-dimensional PLN data. We test two variations of ADI on simulated data and show that injecting an antiplanet signal before stellar estimation helps localize the planet due to self-subtraction at lower separations."}

However, the universality of the CMF and its relationship to the initial mass function (IMF) remain unclear. We study the CMF in the earliest stage of high-mass star formation using 461 prestellar core candidates and 254 protostellar cores as a part of the ALMA Survey of 70 μm Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). We find that prestellar core candidates tend to have lower masses than protostellar cores. We also find that the lifetime of prestellar cores is several times longer than the freefall time, although it approaches the freefall time as the core mass increases. The CMF, including both protostellar and prestellar cores, has a power-law slope of $-2.05\\pm0.04$, shallower than Salpeter's IMF slope of -2.35. Conversely, the CMF of gravitationally bound, prestellar cores has a steeper slope ($-2.32\\pm0.30$), indistinguishable from Salpeter's slope. This finding is consistent with observations in both low-mass star-forming regions and high-mass protoclusters, implying a universal core formation mechanism. The protostellar CMF with a larger maximum core mass can be reproduced by the prestellar CMF when an external gas infall is considered. The inferred mass infall rate is higher than the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate and follows a shallower mass dependence (smaller power-law index), more consistent with the tidal-lobe accretion. This may contribute to the evolution of CMFs seen in later stages."}

The resulting galaxy population exhibits a wide diversity in structural properties that encompasses those of the actual Milky Way, providing a powerful statistical sample for galactic archaeology. To demonstrate the suite's scientific utility, we investigate the connection between a galaxy's merger history, focusing on Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus~(GSE) analogs, and its present-day properties. We find that galaxies with a GSE analog have lower star formation rates, more compact disks, and more spherical stellar halos. Crucially, significant halo-to-halo scatter remains, demonstrating that matching more than the most significant events in the Milky Way's past is necessary to recover its present-day properties.

For this we consider the effect of an intense density-dependent axially symmetric stellar magnetic field ${\\bf B}(r,θ)$ adding another much weaker, but non-vanishing, electric field. We particularize the latter for the case when a finite chiral charge density is present. The axion field is thus coupled to a generic function $Q(F_0,G_0)$ depending on Lorentz invariants $F_0, G_0$ which can be constructed from these electromagnetic fields. From this, the static axion field equations are solved as function of stellar radial coordinate and angular direction, $a(r,θ)$, using a prescribed linear form for $Q$. In addition, we use a semi-analytical approach to calculate the stellar structure in this hybrid system where pressure components are treated under a perturbative scheme, provided induced deformations with respect to spherical symmetry are tiny. Our results show that the axion couplings to magnetic and electric fields along with its mass, critically determine the axion spatial distribution. Furthermore, we focus on the possibility that the axion field might accumulate in specific outer regions of the star, particularly within the crust, where it could form a condensate. We explore the possible presence of magnetic flux tubes from superconductor phases in this outer layers and qualitatively show they may enhance local conversion into photons. We explore prospects of detectability through indirect methods."}

Overview and Scatter of the Star-Forming Main Sequence", "categories": ["astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "19 pages, 11 figures, submitted to ApJ", "summary": "Episodic star formation cycles in both high- and low-redshift galaxies have gained more and more evidence. This paper aims to understand the detailed physical processes behind such behaviors and investigate how such an episodic star-forming scenario can explain the scatter in star-formation rate (SFR) of star-forming main-sequence galaxies. This is achieved through tracing back in time the history of z=0 star-forming central galaxies in the TNG100 simulation over the past 7-8 Gyrs. As the first paper in this series, we provide an overview of the episodic star formation history. We find that two branches of star formation typically develop during each episode: while one branch happens in heavily metal-enriched gas in the centers of galaxies, a secondary branch starts in lower-metallicity regions at galaxy outskirts where fresh gas first arrives, and gradually progresses to inner regions of galaxies. Additionally, the temporal variation in the SFR at galaxy outskirts is more significant than that at centers. As a consequence, the metallicities in both gas and young stars exhibit remarkably different distributions between SFR peaks and valleys. The resulting temporal SFR fluctuation within individual galaxies has an average of ~ 0.2 dex, while the intrinsic differentiation between (the historical mean of) galaxies is ~ 0.15 dex. These two together can well account for the scatter in SFR of ~ 0.25 dex as observed for z=0 star-forming main-sequence galaxies."}

WL induces stringent requirements on the shape and stability of the VIS instrument system point spread function (PSF). The PSF is affected by error contributions from the telescope, the focal plane and image motion, and is controlled by a global error budget with error allocations to each contributor. Aims. During spacecraft development, we verified through a structural-thermal-optical performance (STOP) analysis that the built and verified telescope with its spacecraft interface meets the in-orbit steady-state and transient image quality requirements. Methods. For the purposes of the STOP analysis, a detailed finite-element mathematical model was set up and a standard set of test cases, both steady-state and transient, was defined, comprising combinations of worst-case boundary conditions. Results. The STOP analysis addressed the interaction of all spacecraft components in transmitting temperature-induced loads that lead to optical train deformation. The results of the prelaunch analysis demonstrated that temperature-induced optical perturbations will be well below the allowable limits for all permitted observing conditions. During the first year in orbit, we used the STOP analysis predictions to help interpret the measured performance as a function of environmental variables. Unpredicted disturbances were discovered and unexpected sensitivities were revealed. In-orbit temperature variations are small (<300 mK) and so are their effects on the telescope structure, but they are detected in the time histories of the image quality metrics and are a non-negligible factor in the PSF stability budget demanded by the WL science. Taking everything into account, our analysis confirms the excellent overall performance of the telescope."}

Using a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations, we study the evolution of isolated halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with massive PCs embedded at their centers, a scenario that could be realized in certain SIDM models with light mediators that predict a small-scale suppression of the linear matter power spectrum. We track the evolution of three equally concentrated $10^7\\,{\\rm{M}}_\\odot$ halos, hosting PCs of various total masses, and quantify how the presence of a PC affects the processes of core formation and collapse. Early in the core-formation phase, halos with more prominent PCs exhibit a delayed evolution by a factor of $\\sim 2$ due to smaller velocity dispersion gradients in the inner region. During most of the core-collapse phase, the halo evolution becomes closely aligned in physical time, with appropriate rescaling of densities, radii, and velocity dispersions. The scale densities and radii preserve the virial mass of the original halos, but with increased concentration. Deviations occur at the late phase of core-collapse at the level of $\\sim 5\\%$ relative to the reference collapse track of an NFW halo. These deviations depend non-trivially on both the increased concentration incurred by the PCs, as well as the velocity dispersion (temperature) of the outer halo regions, which can inhibit or enhance the heat transfer process. Our simulations illustrate the complex interplay between the inner and outer halo profiles in determining the onset of core collapse and motivate future studies in the full cosmological context."}

The fitting engine is built from scratch with minimal dependencies, creating an ecosystem where the LLM can reason about fits through function calls-adjusting wavelength windows, adding blend components, modifying continuum treatment, and flagging problematic cases. Egent operates directly on raw flux spectra without requiring pre-normalized continua. We validate against manual measurements from human experts using 18,615 lines from the C3PO program across 84 Magellan/MIKE spectra at SNR~50-250. We find per-spectrum systematic offsets between Egent and expert measurements, likely arising from differences in global continuum placement prior to manual fitting; after accounting for these offsets, the agreement is 5-7 milliangstrom. The LLM's primary role is quality control: it confirms good fits (~60-65% of lines are LLM-refined and accepted), flags problematic cases (~10-20%), and occasionally rescues edge cases where tool use improves fits. Agreement between GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini confirms reproducibility, with GPT-5-mini enabling low-cost analysis at ~200 lines per US dollar. Every fit stores complete Voigt parameters, continuum coefficients, and LLM reasoning chains, enabling exact reconstruction without re-running. Egent compresses what traditionally requires months of expert effort into days of automated analysis, enabling survey-scale EW measurement. We provide open-source code at https://github.com/tingyuansen/Egent, including a web interface for drag-and-drop analysis and a local LLM backend for fully offline operation on consumer hardware."}

In addition to massive black holes (MBHs) in on-going galaxy mergers, this selection can also find MBHs that have been ejected from the host galaxy nucleus due to MBH binary coalescence and asymmetric gravitational wave emission or the dynamical `slingshot' mechanism. Recoiling/slingshot MBHs are predicted to affect co-evolution between MBHs and their host galaxies, and they are observational tracers of past binary MBH mergers and gravitational wave emission. This is the first systematic search through an integral field spectroscopy survey for ejected MBHs to enable uniform constraints on their surface densities. We find that 42% (6/14) have optical image counterparts consistent with galaxy stellar cores from infalling MBHs before the close binary MBH stage. The remaining 58% (8/14) have large broad line luminosities relative to their stellar core mass upper limits (~2 times larger than for central AGN), suggesting merger-driven MBH accretion enhancements or potentially ejected MBHs. The signatures of AGN-ionized narrow emission lines for recoil/slingshot candidates are weaker by 68%, which is consistent with the ejected MBH scenario. The broad line projected velocity offsets range from ~10-600 km/s and suggest motion within the host galaxy potentials. Finally, the implied recoiling MBH surface density upper limit is consistent with predictions that assume random spin orientations in MBH binaries."}

Upon generating the gravi-axion mass term, we discuss the cosmology of the theory. We find that the gravi-axion can be produced to be the dominant dark matter component via misalignment or gravitational particle production, and that in a different regime, the gravi-axion can act as dynamical dark energy.

In this work, we test this hypothesis using a suite of turbulent simulations with Mach numbers $\\mathcal{M}=4$ and 8, and three turbulent forcing wavenumbers ($k_{\\rm for}=2,4$ and 8). Dense cores are identified through dendrogram analysis of column density maps, and their separations are compared to the sonic scale measured from velocity structure functions. We find no statistical correlation between the core separation and the sonic scale nor with the driving scale. Instead, for each run, the core separation spans the entire range of values between these two scales. Our results indicate that fragmentation in turbulence-dominated clouds is not governed by an intrinsic scale in the turbulent cascade. This finding calls into question the use of the sonic scale as a predictive quantity in star formation theories and cautions against interpreting observational core spacings as evidence for universal turbulent fragmentation physics."}

Cosmic messengers, especially neutrinos, play a central role in probing new physics, as they provide experimental conditions far beyond the reach of laboratories and serve as the link between laboratory fundamental-physics discoveries and their roles in the Universe, where many new physics motivations originate. In this work, we propose a novel probe of neutrino self-interactions through ultra-high-energy neutrinos scattering off the cosmic neutrino background when the lightest neutrino species remains relativistic today. This allows us to ``Widen the Resonance'' of such scattering. Meanwhile, we also provide a semi-analytic framework for cosmogenic UHE neutrino production, avoiding computationally intensive simulations and yielding results precise enough for BSM studies.

We compare our interim calibration in gri with that of Pan-STARRS, the DECam Plane Survey (DECaPS-2) and Skymapper. We use the comparisons to identify small gri photometric offsets. Corrections to the Ha and u magnitude scales are determined via comparison with synthetic photometry. VPHAS+ and its northern counterpart, the INT Galactic Plane Survey (IGAPS), are shown to closely align, where they overlap across the celestial equator. Aided by Gaia Data Release 3, SIMBAD, and specialist catalogues, we present selections of: A stars; sub-luminous stars; intrinsically-red luminous stars; young stellar objects; emission-line and OB stars. Attention is drawn to stellar variability as a contaminant in selecting emission line objects via (r - Ha) excess. It is argued the (r - i, r - Ha) plane is the better choice for this selection than (g - i, r - Ha). Using A stars to map extinction, we trace the main run of dust obscuration, situated at mainly negative Galactic latitudes. Like the dust, OB and emission line stars are more frequent below the Galactic equator: at heliocentric distances of up to ~7 kpc, these stars' distribution fit in with the known warping of the Galactic plane. An overdensity of B stars, several degrees across and potentially in the Outer Arm, is found around (l,b) = (212.0, -0.6)."}

Accepted for publication in A&A", "summary": "Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are among the most precise cosmological distance indicators used to study the expansion history of the Universe. The vast increase of SN Ia data due to large-scale astrophysical surveys has led to the discovery of a wide variety of SN Ia sub-classes, such as transitional and fast-declining SNe Ia. However, their distinct photometric and spectroscopic properties differentiate them from the population of normal SNe Ia such that their use as cosmological tools remains challenged. Here, we present a high-cadenced photometric and spectroscopic dataset of two SNe Ia, SNe 2020ue and 2020nlb, which were discovered in the nearby Virgo cluster of galaxies. Our study shows that SN 2020nlb is a normal SN Ia whose unusually red color is intrinsic, arising from a lower photospheric temperature rather than interstellar reddening, providing clear evidence that color diversity among normal SNe Ia can have a physical origin. In contrast, SN 2020ue has photometric properties, such as color evolution and light-curve decay rate, similar to those of transitional SNe, spectroscopically it is more aligned with normal SNe Ia. This is evident from spectroscopic indicators such as the pseudo-equivalent width of \\ion{Si}{II} lines. Thus, such SNe Ia that are photometrically at the edge of the standard normal SNe Ia range may be missed in cosmological SNe Ia samples. Our results highlight that spectroscopic analysis of SNe Ia around peak brightness is crucial for identifying intrinsic color variations and constructing a more complete and physically homogeneous SN Ia sample for precision cosmology."}

In this study, we apply the RSM algorithm to analyze the F150 sample from the SHINE high-contrast imaging survey carried out with VLT/SPHERE, aiming to enhance detection limits and identify new exoplanet candidates. Additionally, we investigate how environmental conditions influence post-processed noise distributions and detection thresholds. We generate detection maps and contrast curves for 213 observations in the F150 SHINE sample using the RSM algorithm. A clustering approach based on environmental parameters is used to group observations with similar noise characteristics. We propose two methods for defining radial detection thresholds in the RSM maps: fitting a log-normal distribution to the post-processed noise and maximizing the F1 score. We also assess the performance of various combinations of post-processing techniques within the RSM framework to identify optimal configurations. This study demonstrates the utility of clustering based on observational parameters, effectively distinguishing features like wind-driven halos and low-wind effects. Detection thresholds vary significantly across clusters, differing by up to a factor of 10, highlighting the importance of considering observational environments. Log-normal thresholds provide conservative, noise-aware limits, while F1 score-based thresholds offer observation-specific results, both showing compatibility overall. RSM improves detection limits by an average factor of two at 1arcsec and five at inner working angles compared to standard PCA processing. This study reports more than 30 newly detected signals, including one promising candidate awaiting second-epoch confirmation."}

ARIMA models provide a versatile parametric description of stochastic variability in this context. However, their practical use is limited by the challenge of selecting optimal model orders while avoiding overfitting. We present a novel solution to this problem using a Bayesian framework for time series modelling in astronomy by combining Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models with the Nested Sampling algorithm. Our method yields Bayesian evidences for model comparison and also incorporates an intrinsic Occam's penalty for unnecessary model complexity. A vectorized ARIMA Nested Sampling framework is implemented allowing us to perform model selection across grids of Autoregressive (AR) and Moving Average (MA) orders, with efficient inference of selected model parameters. The method is validated on simulated and real astronomical time series, including the yearly sunspots number record, Kepler Lightcurves data of the red giant KIC 12008916, and TESS photometry of the exoplanet host star Ross 176. In all cases, the algorithm correctly identified the true or best-fitting model while simultaneously yielding well constrained posterior distributions for the model parameters. Our results demonstrate that Nested Sampling offers a potentially rigorous alternative to autoregressive model selection in astronomical time series analysis."}

Out of 2416 fields with ALMA detections (from a total of 3,089 analyzed maps), we identify 474 multiple systems within a radius of 16 arcsec (equivalent to the 500 $μ$m Herschel beam-size): 420 doubles, 51 triples, and 3 quadruples. In each case the brightest source contributes, on average, 64, 48, and 42 per cent of the total flux in double, triple, and quadruple systems. The average combined ALMA flux density of the sources in double systems is comparable to that of the two brightest components within triple and quadruple systems. Non-parametric tests suggest that only a small fraction of the double systems ($\\lesssim13$ per cent) are comprised of sources with compatible redshifts, while 47-67 per cent of triple and quadruple fields contain at least one potentially associated pair. Simulations using a mock catalogue of dusty star-forming galaxies suggest that 32 per cent of the double systems are likely physically associated ($Δz < 0.01$, i.e. $\\lesssim$10 comoving Mpc at $z = 3$) and, while only 8 per cent of the triple and none of the quadruple systems meet this criterion, $\\sim$ 70 per cent of them include at least one likely associated pair.

Here we present the final review and analysis of this OzDES reverberation mapping campaign. These observations use 6-7 years of photometric and spectroscopic observations of 735 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the redshift range $z\\in [0.13, 3.85]$ and bolometric luminosity range $\\log_{10}(L_{\\mathrm{bol}})\\in [44.3, 47.5] \\mathrm{erg/s}$. Both photometry and spectra are observed in visible wavelengths, allowing for the physical scale of the AGN broad line region to be estimated from reverberations of the Hbeta, MgII and CIV emission lines. We successfully use reverberation mapping to constrain the masses of 62 super-massive black holes, and combine with existing data to fit a power law to the lag-luminosity relation for the Hbeta and MgII lines with a scatter of $\\sim0.25$ dex, the tightest and most robust fit yet identified. We fit a similarly constrained relation for CIV, resolving a tension with the low luminosity literature AGN by accounting for selection effects. We also examine the impact of emission line width and luminosity (related to accretion rate) in reducing the scatter of these scaling relationships and find no significant improvement over the lag-only approach for any of the three lines. Using these relations, we further estimate the masses and accretion rates of 246 AGN. We also use these relations to estimate the relative sizes of the Hbeta, MgII and CIV emitting regions, and find evidence that the MgII emission may occur further out than Hbeta. In short, we provide a comprehensive benchmark of high redshift AGN reverberation mapping at the close of this most recent generation of surveys, including light curves, time-delays, and the most reliable radius-luminosity relations to date."}

We assess the impact of disk gravity, accretion, disk-scattered light, dippers, starspots, jets, and outflows on the measured proper motion anomalies, concluding that astrometric techniques such as the one of this work can be robustly applied to YSOs. Significant proper motion anomalies are found in 31 transition disks (32% of the sample), indicative of companions. We recover 85% of known companions within our sensitivity range. We model the semi-major axis and mass required for a companion to reproduce the observed astrometric signals. Most inferred companions have $M > 30$ M$\\rm{_{J}}$, placing many within or near the stellar mass regime. Seven sources host companions compatible with a planetary mass ($M < 13$ M$\\rm{_{J}}$, HD 100453, J04343128+1722201, J16102955-3922144, MHO6, MP Mus, PDS 70, and Sz 76). For the non-detections, we provide the companion masses and semi-major axes that can be excluded in future searches. About half (53%) of detected companions cannot be reconciled with having carved the observed dust cavities. We find that transition disks host as many companions within our sensitivity range as do randomly sampled groups of YSOs and main-sequence stars. If dust cavities are shaped by companions, such companions must reside at larger orbital separations than those of the companions detected here, and we predict them to be of planetary mass.

We conducted a detailed analysis of their optical light curves (g- and r-bands) over the past five years using the root mean square (RMS)-Flux relation, flux distribution, and QPO detection methods to investigate their variability characteristics. A linear RMS-Flux relation is present in both bands, and their flux distributions follow a log-normal form. This suggests that optical variability may arise from multiplicative, nonlinear processes across different timescales and flux states. Further QPO analysis using the weighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) methods identified candidate periodic signals in four blazars. J 0923.5+4125 (period $\\sim$ 205 days) and J 1221.3+3010 ($\\sim$ 630 days) show local significances of $\\sim 3 σ$, whereas J 1503.5+4759 ($\\sim$ 38.5 days) and J 1652.7+4024 ($\\sim$ 48 days) reach $\\sim 4 σ$.

Participants also exhibited a novel 'conviction intensity gap': while overestimating expert belief prevalence (67.63% vs. 58.20% actual), they underestimated expert conviction strength, perceiving only 21.10% as holding definitive beliefs. Experimental revelation of actual consensus (N = 5,106; 83.51% passed manipulation check) produced negligible personal belief change (d = -0.11) and small social belief change (d = 0.14).

For magnetic black holes, we compute the Lee-Nair-Weinberg instability and revisit early universe pair creation rates, including singular instantons that substantially enhance production, to demonstrate that the extreme charges required for stability are cosmologically implausible. Finally, we suggest that an extremal Kerr black hole could shed angular momentum via superradiant scattering from the stochastic gravitational wave background.

Here we present the final review and analysis of this OzDES reverberation mapping campaign. These observations use 6-7 years of photometric and spectroscopic observations of 735 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the redshift range $z\\in [0.13, 3.85]$ and bolometric luminosity range $\\log_{10}(L_{\\mathrm{bol}})\\in [44.3, 47.5] \\mathrm{erg/s}$. Both photometry and spectra are observed in visible wavelengths, allowing for the physical scale of the AGN broad line region to be estimated from reverberations of the Hbeta, MgII and CIV emission lines. We successfully use reverberation mapping to constrain the masses of 62 super-massive black holes, and combine with existing data to fit a power law to the lag-luminosity relation for the Hbeta and MgII lines with a scatter of $\\sim0.25$ dex, the tightest and most robust fit yet identified. We fit a similarly constrained relation for CIV, resolving a tension with the low luminosity literature AGN by accounting for selection effects. We also examine the impact of emission line width and luminosity (related to accretion rate) in reducing the scatter of these scaling relationships and find no significant improvement over the lag-only approach for any of the three lines. Using these relations, we further estimate the masses and accretion rates of 246 AGN. We also use these relations to estimate the relative sizes of the Hbeta, MgII and CIV emitting regions, and find evidence that the MgII emission may occur further out than Hbeta. In short, we provide a comprehensive benchmark of high redshift AGN reverberation mapping at the close of this most recent generation of surveys, including light curves, time-delays, and the most reliable radius-luminosity relations to date."}

In the case of a massive entropic environment, the attractor Bunch--Davies vacuum plays a special role: it is the only state that can undergo full recoherence, whereas all excited initial states exhibit persistent loss of purity. To characterize this behavior, we parameterize excited Gaussian initial states by their Bogoliubov coefficients and compute the purity and Rényi-2 entropy of the reduced adiabatic state as information-theoretic indicators of decoherence dynamics. We find that excited states display \\emph{purity-freezing} at a non-zero plateau, where residual quantum correlations persist indefinitely, a qualitative departure from the complete recoherence observed for the Bunch--Davies vacuum. This sensitivity to initial conditions highlights the non-generic nature of full recoherence in the quantum-to-classical transition of inflationary perturbations."}

The geometric and dynamical properties of weak stability boundary structures are firstly analyzed, which provides further insights into the training of the deep neural network models. Then, the optimal hyperparameter combinations are determined by examining the identification precision of the trained deep neural network models. The performance of the models with the optimal hyperparameter combinations is further validated using the representative test datasets, achieving the precision of 97.26-99.91%.

These experiments are tailored to mimic what is expected to be the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) accretion event, which occurred circa 10 Gyr ago in the Milky Way (MW). We find that either an early clumpy phase or a retrograde merger significantly reduces the star formation rate (SFR) of the disk, giving rise to a chemical bimodality qualitatively similar to the MW's. The decrease of the SFR as the cause of the chemical bimodality is consistent with previous idealized and cosmological simulations. On the other hand, a prograde radial merger does not significantly modify the SFR of the disk, resulting in no clear chemical bimodality. We further show that stars originating from the inner regions ($R_{form}<4$ kpc) do not create the disk's chemical bimodality, although they can enhance it. Finally, only the models with an early clumpy phase can produce a significant fraction of old, age $>11$ Gyr, $α-$poor stars with disk-like orbits, similar to what has been recently observed in the MW. Our results strengthen the case of clumpy disky galaxies observed at redshift $z\\approx 1-2$ as likely progenitors of our Galaxy."}

A recently proposed method, Large/Small Eddy Simulation (L/SES), aims to overcome this limitation while still providing the solution fidelity comparable to that of DNS. L/SES represents a pair of coupled calculations: a lower-fidelity Large Eddy Simulation (LES), which captures the large-scale flow structure, and a high-fidelity Small-Eddy Simulation (SES) targeting a sub-region of interest of the LES, in which the small-scale dynamics is fully resolved. In this study, we demonstrate the accuracy and performance of L/SES in large Reynolds-number homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) up to Taylor-scale Reynolds number approximately 600. Turbulence properties obtained with L/SES are shown to be in close agreement with the literature, both in terms of global characteristics, such as kinetic energy spectra and dissipative anomaly, as well as small-scale properties, such as higher-order moments of the velocity gradients up to the 10th order and probability density functions of the intermittent quantities. Also using simulations of HIT, we systematically investigate various method parameters and determine their optimal converged values. Finally, we discuss the computational cost of L/SES and demonstrate that it is approximately 3 orders of magnitude lower than for a traditional DNS at the highest Reynolds number considered here. This highlights the potential of L/SES as a discovery tool, which brings high-fidelity simulations of realistic flows into the realm of feasibility."}

The twisted halo may arise from the disk-halo angular momentum shift triggered by the infall of a massive satellite. The anisotropic density distribution of the stellar halo is also measured, with successful re-identification of the Hercules-Aquila Cloud South/North (HAC-N/-S) and Virgo overdensities (VOD). Break radii are found at 15/30 kpc for VOD/HAC-N(-S). We identify the LMC transient density wake with a break radius at 60 kpc in the Pisces overdensity region.

Using {\\it Spitzer} 8 and 24 micron, and unWISE 12 $μ$m images, HFSs are identified as regions where three or more filaments converge onto a central hub, appearing as absorption features toward IRDCs. In each IRDC, HFSs mainly lie at the intersections of elongated substructures, associated with groups of protostars and lacking radio continuum emission. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis shows that protostars are closely associated with the HFSs, with protostellar core separations of $\\leq$ 0.7 pc, indicating strong clustering within fragmented structures. The HFSs form two main groupings spanning 10--15 pc, with member separations of 1--3.3 pc. Around 65\\% are tightly clustered ($<$ 2 pc), exhibiting rich small-scale structures and emphasizing the uniqueness of the complex. MST analysis of ALMAGAL 1.38 mm continuum cores -- predominantly low-mass and embedded in ten HFSs -- reveals a median core separation of $\\sim$0.03 pc.

In this paper, we propose a novel first-order filter for identifying potentially habitable worlds based on a simple geometric ratio: the orbital semi-major axis to the stellar diameter ($d/D_s$). Using data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, we demonstrate that the ideal value for this ratio is not constant, but is dependent on the host star's spectral class.

Accepted for publication in A\\&A", "summary": "Our comprehension of the history of star formation at $z>3$ relies on rest-frame UV observations, yet this selection misses the most dusty and massive sources, yielding an incomplete census at early times. Infrared facilities such as Spitzer and the James Webb Space Telescope have revealed a hidden population at $z=3$-$6$ with extreme red colours, named HIEROs (HST-to-IRAC extremely red objects), identified by the criterion $H_{\\mathrm{E}}-\\mathrm{ch2}>2.25$. Recently, Euclid Early Release Observations (ERO) have made it possible to further study such objects by comparing Euclid data with ancillary Spitzer/IRAC imaging. We investigate a $232$ arcmin$^2$ area in the Perseus field using VIS and NISP photometry, complemented by the four Spitzer channels and ground-based MegaCam bands ($u$, $g$, $r$, ${\\rm H}α$, $i$, $z$). Applying the colour cut yields $121$ HIEROs; after removing globular clusters, brown dwarfs, and unreliable cases through visual inspection of multiband cutouts, we obtain a final sample of $42$ robust HIEROs. Photometric redshifts and physical properties are estimated with the SED-fitting code Bagpipes. From the resulting $z_{\\mathrm{phot}}$ and $M_*$ values, we compute the galaxy stellar mass function at $3.5<z<5.5$. Even after excluding possible AGN hosts or systems where the stellar mass may be overestimated, the high-mass end remains comparable to previous determinations, suggesting the true abundance could be higher. These results highlight the importance of further study of this obscured population to assess its role in the cosmic star-formation rate density and its consistency with galaxy-formation models, demonstrating Euclid's capability to advance our understanding of dust-hidden star formation across early epochs."}

However, confirming these candidates as true planets demands meticulous vetting and follow-up observations, which hampers the discovery of exoplanets in large-scale datasets. To address this challenge, we developed a machine learning framework trained on Kepler's catalog of confirmed exoplanets and false positives to accurately identify true planetary candidates. Our model uses transit properties, planetary characteristics, and host stellar parameters as training features. The optimized model achieved 83.9% accuracy in cross-validation. When applied to 3987 TESS candidates with complete observational data, the model identified 1595 new high-confidence planets and correctly recovered 86% (358/418) of all previously confirmed TESS exoplanets in a blinded validation test. Our analysis revealed 100 previously unrecognized multi-planet systems, including five systems--that host habitable-zone exoplanets. Additionally, we identified 15 more planets within the habitable zone of a single system, suggesting strong potential for liquid water stability under conservative planetary albedo assumptions. This work demonstrates that machine learning can accelerate exoplanet validation while maintaining scientific rigor. Our modular design enables direct adaptation to future photometric missions like PLATO or Earth 2.0."}

When combined with Gaia positional measurements, this data set enables the investigation of the bulk motion and the internal kinematics of these poorly studied clusters to an unprecedented level of detail. Focusing on the case of NGC 6749, we here showcase how the combined Gaia HST proper motions have a quality sufficient to accurately assess the cluster stellar membership, determine its absolute proper motion with a precision superior to Gaia, and to investigate its kinematic profile for the first time. Proper motions are determined using the public code GAIAHUB, which for NGC 6749 combines data sets separated in time by 8 years. The resulting measurements improve the precision of Gaia proper motions by a factor of 10 at the faint end, and enable recovering the proper motion for 662 stars for which Gaia could only measure the positions. These proper motions are efficient in decontaminating the colour magnitude diagram of NGC 6749, and make it possible to compare the efficacy of a method of statistical decontamination that relies only on the photometric information extracted from the HST parallel fields. Finally, using the sample of best measured proper motions we determine the velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles of NGC 6749, that reveal an isotropic behaviour in the cluster inner regions and a slight radial anisotropy outside 1.5 half light radii. The proper motions and the code to statistically decontaminate the clusters color magnitude diagram are made available as public products of the survey."}

Their metallicity distribution encodes the fossil record of the earliest star formation, feedback, and chemical enrichment, providing crucial tests of models of the first stars, galaxy assembly, and dark matter halos. However, due to their faint luminosities and the limited number of bright giants, spectroscopic studies of UFDs typically probe only small stellar samples. Here, we present an analysis of multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope observations of the UFD Bootes I. Using deep color-magnitude diagram in the F606W and F322W2 bands, extending from the subgiant branch to the M-dwarfs, and stellar proper motions to identify likely members, we obtained an unprecedentedly clean census of the system. The exquisite quality of the diagram, combined with the sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to metallicity, allowed us to constrain the metallicity distribution in a large stellar sample. As a first step, we derived the binary fraction in Bootes I. This is crucial, since binaries can bias kinematic mass estimates, affect stellar population analyses, and shape the photometric signatures used to infer metallicity. We find that 20$\\pm$2% of stellar systems in Bootes I are binaries with mass ratios larger than 0.4, corresponding to a total binary fraction of $\\sim$30%. This value is comparable to the binary fractions observed in globular clusters of similar stellar mass, suggesting that the presence of dark matter does not significantly affect the binary properties of Bootes I. We then exploited the metallicity sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to derive the metallicity distribution function. We find that most of the stars $\\sim$85% have [Fe/H]<-2, and that roughly $\\sim$17% have [Fe/H]<-3."}

We derive the astrometric resoeccentric degeneracy: an astrometric analogue of the well-known radial velocity degeneracy in which a single eccentric planet can mimic two circular planets near a 2:1 period ratio. To first order in eccentricity, the sky-projected motion of a single eccentric orbit decomposes into a fundamental mode and first harmonic with an amplitude proportional to that eccentricity. A pair of coplanar, circular planets in a 2:1 orbital resonance produces the same harmonic structure: the outer planet sets the fundamental mode, while the inner planet supplies an apparent first harmonic. We present a mapping between the harmonic amplitudes and effective eccentricity ($e_\\mathrm{eff}$) of a single planet that mimics a 2:1 configuration, demonstrating that $e_\\mathrm{eff} = \\, 2^{1/3}(M_{p,2}/M_{p,1})$, the masses of the inner and outer planets, respectively. Using simulated Gaia data we show that (1) coplanar 2:1 systems are statistically indistinguishable from a single eccentric planet and (2) mutual inclination can break this degeneracy. This bias favors detecting mutually inclined systems, often fingerprints of a dynamically hot history -- traces for processes such as planet-planet scattering or secular chaos. Determining the planetary architectures in which this degeneracy holds will be essential for measuring cool-giant occurrence rates with Gaia and for inferring their dynamical evolution histories."}

For star-forming galaxies (SFGs), our results show excellent consistency with previous studies in terms of the star formation main sequence and the size-mass relation, demonstrating the robustness of our stellar mass and SFR measurements. For spatially resolved profiles, we find that at higher redshifts ($z>2.5$), the median radial profile of $Σ_{\\rm SFR}$ is nearly parallel to but slightly steeper than that of $Σ_*$. This results in mildly negative gradients in the specific SFR (sSFR) profiles across all stellar mass bins considered. These findings indicate that galaxies at $z>2.5$ cannot grow in size via only in-situ star formation, challenging the understanding of galaxy size evolution beyond the cosmic noon. In contrast, at $z<2.0$, the sSFR profiles transition to exhibit more and more positive gradients at lower redshifts, consistent with an inside-out growth scenario where star formation preferentially expands the galactic outskirts."}

This line has a very high optical depth and the emergent line intensity is sensitive to radiative transfer effects such as line scattering by water molecules in a low-density halo surrounding the dense PDR and the assumed microturbulent line width. A more accurate model of the water surface chemistry is required."}

With a median $E(B-V)=0.44\\pm0.14$, we identify the presence of stellar absorption across the arc both in Balmer lines and the MgII doublet, indicative of older stellar populations dominated by A stars (and potentially B stars). Using spatially-resolved maps of rest-optical strong emission lines, we find a heterogeneous distribution of nebular metallicities across the arc, potentially hinting at different enrichment processes.

Here, we present new ALMA observations of [BHB2007]1, a flat-spectrum source connected to at least three such elongated structures. Two of these features are symmetrically located to the north and south of the disk, with velocities aligned with the disk on their respective sides. However, their unbound kinematics and curved morphology make it difficult to determine their origin. Possible explanations include outflows, interactions with the nearby BHB2 system, and hyperbolic infall, but none fully account for all observed properties. In contrast, a newly identified collimated structure to the west shows clear evidence of gravitationally bound infall. Estimates of its mass, mass infall rate, and angular momentum suggest that this infalling streamer would roughly double the mass budget available to form planets and tilt the disk by a few tens of degrees. Furthermore, its misalignment with the midplane of the disk and the lack of diffuse envelope emission indicate that the streamer may have formed due to gravitational capture of cloud material unrelated to the source's natal core. Together, these findings support a more dynamic picture of star formation, one where environmental interactions continue to shape conditions for building planetary systems."}

We used data from the first four SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Surveys and an archival Chandra observation to image the X-ray emission from Abell 1060.

The surface brightness and spectral analyses are also extended until 3$R_{200}$ and $R_{200}$, respectively, following a detailed cosmic X-ray background (CXB) analysis. Our fully corrected eROSITA image showcases a relaxed ICM morphology within $R_{500}$. We detect two weak ICM shocks with Mach number $M\\approx 1.5$ near the central galaxy NGC 3311 that coincide with diffuse radio emission along the line of sight. Furthermore, we detect multiple soft X-ray excesses with high spatial correlation with the 2D optical galaxy distribution beyond $R_{200}$. In particular, the excess in the north has a significance of $5.8σ$ above the local CXB level. This suggests that Abell 1060's outskirts are actively accreting baryons.

The origin of this pattern remains debated, limiting how these isotopic signatures can be used to trace the precursors of terrestrial planets. Here we test the hypothesis that interstellar ices carried supernova-produced nuclides by searching for a supernova nucleosynthetic fingerprint in aqueous alteration minerals from carbonaceous and non-carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. We focus on zirconium, a refractory element that includes the neutron-rich isotope $^{96}$Zr formed in core-collapse supernovae. Leaching experiments reveal extreme $^{96}$Zr enrichments in alteration minerals, showing that they incorporated supernova material hosted in interstellar ices. We show that the Solar System's zirconium isotope variability reflects mixing between these ices and an ice-free rocky component. Finally, the presence of supernova nuclides in a volatile carrier supports models where the Solar System's nucleosynthetic variability was imparted by thermal processing of material in the protoplanetary disk and during planetary accretion."}

A joint fit between SXT and LAXPC, and between Swift-XRT and NuSTAR has been done for constraining the synchrotron peak. A clear shift in the synchrotron peak has been observed, which included 1ES 2344+514 in the HSP BL Lac family. A `harder-when-brighter' trend is observed in X-rays, and the opposite trend, i.e., `softer-when-brighter', is seen in the $γ$-rays. The multi-epoch broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of this source were built and studied to get an idea of the radiation processes. The SEDs were fitted using a steady-state leptonic one-zone synchrotron+SSC model, and the fitted parameters of the emission region are consistent with those of other TeV BL Lacs. In this study, we found a weak correlation tendency between bolometric luminosity and magnetic field (B), as well as between bolometric luminosity and the break Lorentz factor ($γ_{break}$)."}

Several source extraction programs, including SoFiA and Aegean, have been developed to address this challenge. However, finding optimal parameter configurations when applying these programs to real observations is non-trivial. For example, the outcomes of SoFiA intensely depend on several key parameters across its preconditioning, source-finding, and reliability-filtering modules. To address this issue, we propose a framework to automatically optimize these parameters using an AI agent based on a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, i.e., Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The SKA Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset is utilized to assess the feasibility and reliability of this framework. The AI agent interacts with the environment by adjusting parameters based on the feedback from the SDC2 score defined by the SDC2 Team, progressively learning to select parameter sets that yield improved performance. After sufficient training, the AI agent can automatically identify an optimal parameter configuration that outperform the benchmark set by Team SoFiA within only 100 evaluation steps and with reduced time consumption. Our approach could address similar problems requiring complex parameter tuning, beyond radio band surveys and source extraction. Yet, high-quality training sets containing representative observations and catalogs of ground truth are essential."}

To be submitted. Comments welcome. Code available at https://github.com/tingyuansen/Egent", "summary": "We present Egent, an autonomous agent that combines classical multi-Voigt profile fitting with large language model (LLM) visual inspection and iterative refinement. The fitting engine is built from scratch with minimal dependencies, creating an ecosystem where the LLM can reason about fits through function calls-adjusting wavelength windows, adding blend components, modifying continuum treatment, and flagging problematic cases. Egent operates directly on raw flux spectra without requiring pre-normalized continua. We validate against manual measurements from human experts using 18,615 lines from the C3PO program across 84 Magellan/MIKE spectra at SNR~50-250. We find per-spectrum systematic offsets between Egent and expert measurements, likely arising from differences in global continuum placement prior to manual fitting; after accounting for these offsets, the agreement is 5-7 milliangstrom. The LLM's primary role is quality control: it confirms good fits (~60-65% of lines are LLM-refined and accepted), flags problematic cases (~10-20%), and occasionally rescues edge cases where tool use improves fits. Agreement between GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini confirms reproducibility, with GPT-5-mini enabling low-cost analysis at ~200 lines per US dollar. Every fit stores complete Voigt parameters, continuum coefficients, and LLM reasoning chains, enabling exact reconstruction without re-running. Egent compresses what traditionally requires months of expert effort into days of automated analysis, enabling survey-scale EW measurement. We provide open-source code at https://github.com/tingyuansen/Egent, including a web interface for drag-and-drop analysis and a local LLM backend for fully offline operation on consumer hardware."}

To characterize the feedback from the small scales, existing methods employ a static subgrid scheme or one based on theoretical guesses, which usually struggle to capture the time variability and derive physically faithful results. Neural operators are a class of machine learning models that achieve significant speed-up in simulating complex dynamics. We introduce a neural-operator-based ''subgrid black hole'' that learns the small-scale local dynamics and embeds it within the direct multi-level simulations. Trained on small-domain (general relativistic) magnetohydrodynamic data, the model predicts the unresolved dynamics needed to supply boundary conditions and fluxes at coarser levels across timesteps, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts without hand-crafted closures. Thanks to the great speedup in fine-scale evolution, our approach for the first time captures intrinsic variability in accretion-driven feedback, allowing dynamic coupling between the central black hole and galaxy-scale gas. This work reframes subgrid modeling in computational astrophysics with scale separation and provides a scalable path toward data-driven closures for a broad class of systems with central accretors."}

Trumpler 14 (Tr 14), a 1 Myr-old cluster located at a distance of 2.4 kpc, and particularly rich in O-type stars, is an ideal target for such a study. Our goal is to measure the initial mass function (IMF) in the young massive, high UV flux cluster. We present the deepest study to date of the IMF in Tr 14 based on GeMS/GSAOI imaging. We construct the IMF using both the Besancon Galactic model and an observational control field from VISTA for background correction. Completeness was assessed using artificial-star tests and applied to the IMF derivation. We estimate the IMF down to the 20% completeness limit found at 0.01 MSun. Using the control field-based IMF as our primary result, we find a slope of alpha=0.14+-0.19 for masses between 0.01-0.2 MSun, and alpha=1.72+-0.04 for 0.2-4.5 MSun. The low-mass slope is largely influenced by the incompleteness-affected lowest bin; excluding it brings our results into agreement with those from other young clusters. The resulting median for the star-to-BD ratio in the 0.03-1 MSun mass range is 4.0, with a 95% confidence interval of 2.8-5.8. Our analysis reveals that Tr 14 hosts a relatively flat substellar IMF, but this is strongly influenced by the lowest-mass bin, which may be affected by incompleteness. When that bin is excluded, the IMF becomes consistent with those of other regions. The star-to-BD ratio falls within the usually observed 3-6 range, indicating that brown dwarfs with masses above 0.03 MSun form with similar efficiency across environments. However, the relative lack of objects below this threshold suggests that the presence of an environment with both high stellar density and FUV flux may play a role in shaping the IMF by suppressing the formation of BDs at masses < 0.03 MSun."}

We argue that the mm emission comes from a spatially extended region that is magnetically connected to the compact X-ray corona, in analogy to the solar wind and corona. We present an analytic model scaled to corona values in which non-equipartition electrons from multiple heights along an extended conical outflow shape the mm emission. In this model, the 100 GHz emission originates from within $\\lesssim10^4$ gravitational radii ($r_g$) of the central black hole, though the projected distance from the black hole can be as low as $50r_g$ depending on the line-of-sight.

These quantities depend weakly on the underlying electron power-law distribution function and black hole mass.

Our model highlights the need to study continual dissipation along the outflow to connect the X-ray- and mm-emitting regions."}

Observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) allow us to investigate both the availability of different molecules in disks and infer the radial distribution of elemental abundances, enabling us to make connections to exoplanet systems. Here we present a survey of six transition disks around young F-, A-, and B-type stars using ALMA. We find 13C18O, CS, SO, and H2CO in all six systems, as well as ten additional molecules in a subset of disks, including detections of H2S, 33SO, and CH3OCH3. Using these data, and literature data where available, we construct the first comprehensive picture of Herbig disk chemistry. We find clear correlations between molecular tracers of C/O>1 environments (e.g., CS, C2H) and disk mass, as traced by C18O line flux. In contrast, tracers of C/O<1 environments (e.g., SO, CH3OH) do not show significant correlations with disk mass. Interestingly, these molecules are relatively brighter in lower-mass disks, with their presence primarily linked to disks with central cavities and spirals. Finally, we show that the observed chemical diversity seen across Herbig disks leads to varying C/O regimes at the orbital radii of candidate proto-planets identified within these disks. When comparing these inferred disk C/O ratios with those measured for directly imaged exoplanets, we find a notable overlap and show that low C/O gas is common on 10's of au scales in Herbig disks."}

In one of the systems, multiple brightenings occur at similar orbital phases, closely resembling the evolution of FN Sgr, a symbiotic binary with a magnetic white dwarf. The peculiar variability of another symbiotic star is best explained by dust-obscuration events. These results expand the census of Galactic symbiotic stars."}
