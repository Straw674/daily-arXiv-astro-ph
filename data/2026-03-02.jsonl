The selected clouds have diverse properties, across a broad parameter space, resulting in heterogeneous evolution. For the clouds we study, radiative cooling is the dominant physical process enabling cloud survival, while magnetic fields play a comparatively smaller role. The motion of these clouds is governed not only by drag forces that decelerate them, but also by acceleration from momentum exchange with the complex background velocity field, which can cause them to move faster than ballistic projectiles set by their initial velocities. Our results suggest that the non-trivial details of realistic cosmological initial conditions -- specifically the complex density, temperature, and velocity fields -- may play an important role in subsequent cloud evolution, and that sampling the output of an existing large-scale simulation provides a self-consistent approach to capture these effects without ad hoc assumptions."}

Occasional episodes of rapid star formation can push them temporarily above this sequence, turning them into starbursts. Yet some galaxies display starburst-like traits -- rapid, dense, and compact star formation -- while still remaining within the scatter of the main sequence. These \"starbursts in the main sequence\" (SBMSs) reveal the complexity and diversity of star formation modes, making them crucial for understanding how galaxies evolve and transition between different regimes. In this paper, we identify SBMSs in the cosmological simulation NewHorizon and follow their evolution across time to uncover their physical origins and the role of this special regime in shaping galaxy evolution. We explain the existence of SBMSs by a comparatively earlier assembly of their stellar mass, driven in particular by more frequent and repeated mergers as the other galaxies, as well as exceptionally productive starburst events triggered by these interactions. As a result, this regime appears preferentially -- though not exclusively -- in the most massive galaxies. The SBMS behavior is not continuous within individual galaxies but instead arises intermittently as a short-lived (~ 30 Myr) evolutionary mode. Nevertheless, such SBMS episodes exist throughout cosmic time across the galaxy population... [abridged]"}

To address this limitation, we present a catalog of CO spectroscopy based on archival data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) for a sample of galaxies at z > 3, focusing on high-J transitions (Jup = 9-17). Combining ALMA archival data with published measurements, we compile CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) for 38 well-studied systems spanning z ~ 3.1-6.9, including 5 hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs), 17 submillimeter-bright galaxies (SMGs), and 16 optically selected quasars. The class-median SLEDs rise steeply to Jup = 9 and remain approximately flat through Jup ~ 11-12. SMGs show relatively stronger low- to mid-J emission relative to CO J=9-8, while Hot DOGs exhibit tentative evidence for higher excitation. Comparison with simple excitation models suggests that X-ray dominated region (XDR) heating or dense, shock-heated gas can account for the extended high-J CO SLEDs. A tentative anti-correlation between the CO(9-8)-to-infrared luminosity ratio and excitation among the dusty galaxy populations suggests that the enhanced excitation in Hot DOGs may be driven by XDR heating from obscured AGN activity rather than by shocks."}

To address these challenges, we present \\textit{OmegaNeuron}, a machine-learning tool that integrates GravitySpy's image similarity methods with Omega Scan's transient analysis to automate the identification of auxiliary channels that witness glitches.

It predicts $A_V$ within a factor of $\\sim$1.3 on kpc scales. We also demonstrate that the relation can be applied iteratively to recover dust-corrected $Σ_{\\mathrm{SFR}}$ from uncorrected values, converging by the fourth iteration with minimal residual bias ($-0.01$ mag) and low RMSE ($0.42$ mag). The model accurately reproduces $A_V$ maps across diverse morphologies and orientations, including edge-on systems.

Our laser position sensors reach a sub-pm/$\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$ sensitivity above 10 mHz, independent of the input light polarization, representing a 100-fold improvement over the current LIGO position sensors.

Submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "When a dark matter halo falls into a more massive object and becomes a subhalo, it typically loses much of its mass through tidal stripping. The reverse process is also possible in principle. The subhalo may gravitationally capture material from its host. If sufficiently efficient, this process could make an initially starless subhalo visible. We use high-resolution N-body simulations to estimate the efficiency of capture. We find that after an extended period orbiting within its host, at most $\\sim 10^{-4}$ of a subhalo's remaining mass has been acquired since infall. This captured material is less concentrated to subhalo centre than material retained from before infall. It is also very much less abundant than host material that is instantaneously passing through the subhalo on almost unperturbed orbits. Captured stars are not sufficiently spatially concentrated to be distinguished from the dominant background of \"field\" stars, and their concentration in velocity space is no greater than that of typical stellar streams in the halo. Unfortunately, stellar capture is not efficient enough to allow initially starless low-mass subhaloes to be detected."}

SPs are pixels with values $\\le$ $-10$ electrons below the local background of LED-flashed short (0.5 sec) darks, that collect and trap significant charge during readout. Analyzing seven years of short dark data, we assessed SP creation and persistence. In this time frame, 5,430 SPs were created in WFC1 and 5,649 SPs in WFC2, with creation rates of about 2.15 pixels/day and 2.23 pixels/day, respectively. These calculations allowed us to detect 44,068 SPs, not including SP trails, in the detector by the end of 2021, constituting approximately 0.25\\% of the science frame. We found it is rare for SPs to return to a typical, non-negative pixel value. We observed more flagged SPs near the serial register than the chip gap. Skewed histograms for the $y$-position distribution, exhibiting a local peak in the distribution of SPs very near the chip gap described as the ``bounce-back\" effect, were evident for both WFC1 and WFC2, while the $x$-position distribution remained uniform. Examining CTE-corrected images from 2015, 2018, and 2021 revealed consistent trends, with the gradient getting steeper over time due to CTE losses, which is also worse for pixels further from the serial register. We simulated the CTE-impacted readout of a short dark exposure with uniformly distributed SPs, to assess how CTE influences SP detectability. While the gradient effect was reproduced, the local peak near the chip gap was not. Filling in of SPs by CTE charge-release during readout appears to explain most of the gradient in the $y$-position density of SPs."}

From timing analysis, we measure the pulsar's proper motion for the first time, indicating motion away from the Galactic plane at a position angle of 16.7 +/- 4.8 degrees (Galactic coordinates), with a total proper motion of 56.9 +/- 8.0 mas/yr and a corresponding transverse velocity of 329 +/- 80 km/s. This velocity suggests that PSR J1740+1000 is a typical-velocity young pulsar born within the Galactic halo. In scintillation studies, we detect scintillation arcs, arclets, and double-layered adjacent arcs in the secondary spectra. Under isotropic and anisotropic scattering assumptions, the screen-to-pulsar distance is 370 +/- 72 pc and 1 +/- 12 pc, respectively. The latter closely matches the scale of the pulsar wind nebula associated with PSR J1740+1000 and provides a better fit, suggesting that scattering is likely dominated by the PWN. The double-layered adjacent arcs observed on MJD 60180 imply that the pulsar's scattered image consists of two dominant components (A and B) and multiple weaker components. Component A is located at the pulsar's geometric position (0 uas), while Component B is located 112 +/- 16 uas and 23 +/- 17 uas from the central component under isotropic and anisotropic scattering, respectively. The frequency-independent angular position of Component B hints at refraction by an AU-scale structure within the scattering region, possibly originating from the PWN."}

Using orbital parameters from SPT products, we plotted the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) locations during dark exposures relative to the SAA. Comparison of HST paths during elevated and stable dark rate visits revealed no significant correlation between proximity to the SAA boundary and dark rate increases. Furthermore, we examined the stability of dark rates in the vicinity of the SBC-LODARK aperture within the detector. Our findings confirm that this region maintains consistently low dark rates across visits, unaffected by the elevated dark current observed elsewhere in the detector. The SBC-LODARK aperture therefore continues to be recommended for small sources."}

Since ionizing sources and minihalos have different clustering characteristics, not only the reionization history, but also the morphology of the ionization field, is sensitive to the small-scale power spectrum. If the power spectrum at small scales is enhanced compared with the standard six-parameter $Λ$CDM model, then both the sources and sinks of ionizing photons would be boosted and the net impact depends on the competition between them. Therefore, the 21 cm signal that can probe the morphology of the ionization field will be a useful tool for detecting the small-scale power spectrum. Using the power spectrum proposed by Cielo et al. (2025) (C25) as a demonstration, we investigate the influence of small-scale power spectrum enhancement on the ionization field and the 21 cm signal. We find that for the C25 model, even under the constraints of observed UV luminosity functions for high-$z$ galaxies and reionization history, the 21~cm power spectrum and the bubble size distribution could be still significantly different from the regular $Λ$CDM model.

Compact, broadband photonic beam combiners are essential for providing a pathway to complex circuitry on a single chip and scalable solutions for single and multi-telescope instruments, and are investigated herein.\n  Two-waveguide photonic combiners rely on symmetric coupling to interfere light, which is chromatic and requires modification for broadband operation. A three-waveguide configuration (tri-coupler) offers the potential for deeper, broader, and stable achromatic nulls. This work compares simulations of two evanescent tri-couplers and a multimode interference coupler (MMI) across the 1.5 - 1.8 $μ$m band, evaluating exoplanet throughput, starlight attenuation, sensing characteristics, and estimations on fabrication tolerance. The standard tri-coupler was outperformed by both a tapered tri-coupler and the MMI, each of which achieved exoplanet throughput >85% throughout the band. The standard design recorded a minimum exoplanet throughput of 50% at the waveband's extremes. The tapered tri-coupler was further redesigned to achieve a non-degenerate sensing state. The MMI, while limited to a starlight attenuation of 40 dB $\\left(10^{-4}\\right)$ by uncoupled light, showed the greatest tolerance to fabrication errors, offering strong practical potential.\n  Future designs aim to combine high exoplanet throughput, deep starlight attenuation, and non-degenerate sensing within a single integrated architecture."}

Our nearest large neighbor, M31, is classified as a LINER based on its optical emission line properties within the central kpc. In this work, we present a detailed photoionization modeling of the circumnuclear ionized gas in M31, explicitly tailored to its well-constrained physical conditions, including the absence of ongoing star formation and a currently inactive active galactic nucleus (AGN). Using spatially resolved CFHT/SITELLE observations, we find that photoionization by hot, evolved low-mass stars distributed throughout the bulge can roughly reproduce the observed radial intensity profiles of Hα, H\\b{eta}, and [NII]. However, these models fail to match the observed [OIII] emission, producing radial profiles and [O III]/H\\b{eta} ratios that are significantly steeper than observed. This discrepancy indicates a deficit of high-energy ionizing photons in standard stellar photoionization models, even with extended ionizing sources. We explore whether this tension can be alleviated by invoking either a bulge-filling, low-density ionized medium surrounding a denser Hα-emitting disk, or enhanced AGN activity in the recent past. While both scenarios can partially increase the [O III] emission, neither provides a fully satisfactory explanation under physically plausible conditions. Together with our earlier results for M81, these findings underscore persistent challenges in explaining LINER-like emission solely through conventional photoionization mechanisms."}

We investigate whether initialising a simulation with a superposition of linear eigenmodes that contains the most unstable mode saves computation time, and how the selection of the included modes affects the non-linear evolution. Using the non-linear (magneto)hydrodynamic simulation code MPI-AMRVAC, the evolutions of a flow-sheared fluid interface, a Harris current sheet, and a flow-sheared plasma interface were simulated for various initial perturbations. The novel initial perturbations were linear eigenmodes of the equilibrium, or superpositions thereof, and calculated with the Legolas code. We benchmarked to initialisation with velocity noise and, in the case of the Harris sheet, initialisation with an analytic magnetic field perturbation. By perturbing an unstable equilibrium with a superposition of linear eigenmodes that contains the most unstable mode, significantly less computation time is spent on the linear stage of the evolution compared to traditional perturbation methods. In the best case, the simulation time needed to reach the non-linear stage is reduced by an order of magnitude. The inclusion or omission of certain modes in the initial perturbation is observed to affect the non-linear evolution to various degrees. The perturbation of equilibria with a superposition of linear eigenmodes that contains the most unstable mode allows simulations to reach a late-evolution stage faster, thus saving computation time. Additional eigenmodes can be included alongside the fastest growing mode to obtain further benefits, for example, to accelerate symmetry breaking in the non-linear stage, or to delay their effect on the non-linear evolution. Coupling spectroscopic codes with (magneto)hydrodynamic codes therefore offers significant advantages."}

We construct a rigorous framework for conducting the wide binary test (WBT), emphasizing high quality sample selection, filtering of poor astrometric solutions, contamination mitigation, and uncertainty propagation. We show that undetected close binaries, chance alignments, and improper treatment of projection effects can mimic MOND-like signals. We introduce a checklist of best practices to identify and avoid these pitfalls. Applying this framework to Gaia DR3 data, we compile a high-purity sample of WBs within 130 pc with projected separations of 1 - 30 kAU, spanning the transition between the Newtonian and MOND regimes. We find that the scaled relative velocity distribution of wide binaries does not exhibit the 20% enhancement expected from MOND and is consistent with Newtonian gravity across all separations. A meta-analysis of previous WBTs shows that apparent MOND signals diminish as methodological rigour improves. We conclude that when stringent quality controls are applied, there is no observational evidence for MOND-induced velocity boosts in wide binaries. Our results place strong empirical constraints on modified gravity theories operating between a0/10 and 200 a0, where a0 is the MOND acceleration scale. Across this range of internal accelerations, Newtonian gravity is up to 1500x more likely than MOND for our cleanest sample."}

The primary goal of this study was to determine whether the frequency of superbias generation could be reduced without compromising calibration quality, potentially aligning with the Wide Field Camera 3 UVIS (WFC3/UVIS) approach of generating only one superbias per year. We analyzed superbias frames produced from 2007 through 2024 to investigate whether these calibration products have changed significantly over time, and whether the frequency of superbias generation and delivery could be safely reduced without loss of calibration accuracy. In addition to visual inspections and pixel-level comparisons, we employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to evaluate whether any long-term, global structure exists beneath the apparent noise in these frames. Our findings show that the superbias structure has remained fairly stable post-Servicing Mission 4 (SM4), a 15-year period, and no significant or unexpected global trends or systematic shifts were detected. However, due to unstable hot columns and increasing readout dark observed in ACS/WFC data, it is likely that these calibrations still benefit from more frequent superbias updates than the annual cadence adopted for WFC3/UVIS."}

This model is applied to fit the rotation curves of the SPARC sample of 175 galaxies, yielding mass-to-light ratios, goodness of fit measurements, and the free parameter. The model's average reduced chi square compares favorably with the dark matter model for the same data, and more galaxies are successfully fit by this model. The model provides a useful formulation linking luminous matter to the observed rotation curves, with the dark matter contribution to galaxies encoded in two transformation terms of the luminous mass.

Measurements of individual energy spectra are a crucial tool to understand the origin of the knee. Energy reconstruction and composition identification are foundations of the individual energy spectra measurements. One of the main scientific goals of Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) is measuring the cosmic ray energy spectra and composition from ~10 TeV to ~EeV. In this work, a novel method for reconstructing energy and logarithm mass (lnA) based on a superposition model is introduced. Energy and lnA are reconstructed using two universal, composition- and energy-independent calibration lines. For zenith angle below 40 degree, the energy and lnA biases are within +-5% and +-0.3, respectively, across all compositions. The method uses particle densities-measured by LHAASO's electromagnetic and muon detectors at a fixed distance from the shower axis-rather than integrated particle counts in annular bands. The density-based approach improves resolution for both energy and lnA, especially for heavy nuclei. The resulting energy resolution ranges from below 5% to ~15% above 1 PeV, the best mass resolution for iron achieved is below 25% above 10 PeV. The hadronic model dependencies of energy and lnA are also reported. These dependencies scale with lg(E/A) and are nearly independent of primary composition."}

We obtained multi-epoch, near-infrared VLT/KMOS spectroscopic observations of Wd1 to map its population of massive stars. The spectra of ~110 members were analysed with CMFGEN models to derive stellar parameters, populate the cluster Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and compare it with isochrones from evolutionary models. Our observations returned 47 new spectroscopically identified cluster members, with spectral types O9-B1 III-V. The cluster turn-off indicates an age of 5.5+/-1.0 Myr at a distance of 4.23+0.23-0.21 kpc, displaying a moderate degree of coevality. We demonstrate that our estimate of the age of Wd1 is robust against reasonable changes in the distance and extinction law, and the adopted rotational velocity and metallicity of the stellar isochrones. We further find that ~65% of the OB stars with multi-epoch coverage exhibit radial-velocity variability. Infrared observations of the unevolved stellar population support a single episode of star formation with an age of ~5.5 Myr, reinforcing its potential as a benchmark for massive star evolution and providing a reference sample for future binary population studies."}

For $μ(φ)$ diverging at the origin while all physical quantities remain finite, we demonstrate the existence of electrically charged ECOs with a shell-like structure whose density peaks at an intermediate radius. We compute their mass and radius, together with the scalar and vector field profiles, on a static and spherically symmetric background. We then examine the existence of photon rings and place bounds on a model parameter by requiring the absence of a linearly stable photon ring. Under this condition, photon echoes from ECOs are absent. We also compute the gravitational-lensing deflection angle $Ψ$ and show that it attains a maximum for an impact parameter of the same order as the ECO radius. Finally, we study the parameter space in which innermost stable circular orbits of massive particles exist."}

In this study, we explore the use of pool-based active learning to improve the efficiency of habitability classification under realistic observational constraints. We construct a unified dataset from the Habitable World Catalog and the NASA Exoplanet Archive and formulate habitability assessment as a binary classification problem. A supervised baseline based on gradient-boosted decision trees is established and optimized for recall in order to prioritize the identification of rare potentially habitable planets. This model is then embedded within an active learning framework, where uncertainty-based margin sampling is compared against random querying across multiple runs and labeling budgets. We find that active learning substantially reduces the number of labeled instances required to approach supervised performance, demonstrating clear gains in label efficiency. To connect these results to a practical astronomical use case, we aggregate predictions from independently trained active-learning models into an ensemble and use the resulting mean probabilities and uncertainties to rank planets originally labeled as non-habitable. This procedure identifies a single robust candidate for further study, illustrating how active learning can support conservative, uncertainty-aware prioritization of follow-up targets rather than speculative reclassification. Our results indicate that active learning provides a principled framework for guiding habitability studies in data regimes characterized by label imbalance, incomplete information, and limited observational resources."}

The report stresses the need for systematic teaching, training, mentoring, and new support formats to establish sustainable coding and computing practices, particularly among students and early-career researchers, and highlights the importance of dedicated steering and funding instruments to embed sustainability in project planning. Ethical discussions focus on the transformative use of AI in ErUM-Data, addressing autonomy, bias, transparency, explainability, attribution of responsibility, and the risk of deskilling, while reaffirming that accountability for scientific outcomes remains with human researchers. Finally, the report emphasizes that sustainable transformation requires not only technical measures but also targeted awareness-building, communication strategies, incentives, and community-driven initiatives to move from awareness to action and to integrate sustainability and ethics into everyday scientific practice."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "Recently, an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) candidate was announced in the Galactic globular cluster Omega Centauri. IMBHs at the lower end of the traditional mass range have also been detected through gravitational-wave transients, though their formation and subsequent growth linking the two mass scales remains a mystery. One way IMBHs may be produced is through the collapse of very massive stars produced by stellar collisions in dense stellar environments. However, IMBHs may be ejected from such environments by either dynamical recoil from binary-single scattering or gravitational-wave recoil following the merger of two black holes. We conduct Newtonian and post-Newtonian binary-single scattering experiments to study dynamical ejection in greater detail. We obtain fits to the probabilities for dynamical ejection, gravitational wave capture, and per-encounter hardening as a function of the binary mass ratio and hardness with respect to its environment. We borrow techniques from survival analysis (commonly used in studies of medicine, epidemiology, engineering, etc.) to develop a model to calculate the probability of IMBH binary ejection vs in-cluster merger. We confirm that the dynamical ejection probability strongly depends on both the mass ratio of the IMBH compared to other BHs in its environment and on the environment's velocity dispersion. We estimate that for a typical Milky Way globular cluster, IMBHs with mass $\\lesssim10^3\\,\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ are unlikely to be retained until the present. Our results also suggest that IMBH mergers with $q\\lesssim0.2$ may be detectable at higher redshifts with future gravitational wave instruments such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer."}

The reverse process is also possible in principle. The subhalo may gravitationally capture material from its host. If sufficiently efficient, this process could make an initially starless subhalo visible. We use high-resolution N-body simulations to estimate the efficiency of capture. We find that after an extended period orbiting within its host, at most $\\sim 10^{-4}$ of a subhalo's remaining mass has been acquired since infall. This captured material is less concentrated to subhalo centre than material retained from before infall. It is also very much less abundant than host material that is instantaneously passing through the subhalo on almost unperturbed orbits. Captured stars are not sufficiently spatially concentrated to be distinguished from the dominant background of \"field\" stars, and their concentration in velocity space is no greater than that of typical stellar streams in the halo. Unfortunately, stellar capture is not efficient enough to allow initially starless low-mass subhaloes to be detected."}

Since polarimetry is a differential technique, such variations cannot be due to shape changes and must be caused by heterogeneity in surface albedo and/or composition. While (4) Vesta has long been known to exhibit large, repeatable polarization variations across its surface, we discover the variations on (6) Hebe, (12) Victoria, and (65803) Didymos to be 1.5 to 3.5 times as large. We hypothesize that the \\textit{DART} impact with Dimorphos blanketed Didymos with depolarizing ejecta, which suggests pristine variations across Didymos to have been even larger. As the only NEO in this study with data quality sufficient to investigate polarization variations, Didymos' huge variations suggest they may be common among NEOs. We also discover optical circular polarization to be enhanced for low-albedo, M type asteroids, which is correlated with their large radar albedos.

The observed mid-IR emission indicates the presence of newly formed dust, or pre-existing dust heated by the radiation from the supernovae or circumstellar medium interactions. We carried out a systematic analysis of the supernova host environments and their dust properties, for understanding the dust-veiled exploding stars, and whether such an intense dust production process is associated with their local environments. We find that dusty supernovae prefer the locations with higher EW(Hα), lower metallicity, and heavier host extinctions compared to typical SN types, and they show the same increasing sequence in the values of EW(Hα) and oxygen abundance from hydrogen-rich, type IIn and hydrogen-poor dusty supernovae. These differences in environmental properties of different dusty SN types indicate the diversity of their progenitors. We also found that one marginal correlation is a negative correlation between the SN dust mass and star formation rate. This means that SNe would be more mid-IR luminous and more dust-rich at the region with lower star formation rate. However, the SN dust mass show no correlation with the metallicity and the host extinction, which were thought to be key factors affecting the mass-loss history of progenitors and the CSM environment of SNe. Therefore, the dust formation process in SNe might be insensitive to metallicity and the dust condition of their host environments."}

A global $U(1)_{\\rm PQ}$ symmetry with a nonzero QCD anomaly emerges accidentally in this setup as a byproduct of the gauged $U(1)_F$ symmetry. The resulting axion is shown to be of high quality, with the axion potential safeguarded against quantum gravity corrections by the gauge symmetry.

The right-handed neutrino mass scale is identified as the Froggatt-Nielsen scale in these models. We present explicit UV completions of the FN sectors of these models and show that they preserve the high quality of the axion. In these models, the axion acts as a flavon field, leading to testable predictions in flavor-changing decays of neutral mesons. The axion also serves as the dark matter of the universe with the right amount of relic abundance without causing cosmological domain wall problems.

We calibrated the RADEM sensors using galactic cosmic rays by progressively increasing detector thresholds, thereby modifying their response to high-energy particles. Threshold-dependent in-flight count rates were compared with theoretical expectations derived from the Badhwar-O'Neill 2020 galactic cosmic ray model and corresponding response functions. These results were used to derive new in-flight calibration coefficients and to develop a flux reconstruction algorithm based on the bow-tie method. In several cases, the in-flight calibration slopes differ by up to an order of magnitude from ground calibration values. Proton fluxes from solar energetic particle events reconstructed with this method agree within a factor of two with independent measurements from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory. These results demonstrate that RADEM provides accurate proton flux measurements in interplanetary space and is well suited for both single-spacecraft analyses and coordinated multi-mission studies of solar energetic particles.

The masses of 91Rh, 92Pd, and 96Cd were determined for the first time with high precision, and the accuracy of several additional masses was substantially improved. Incorporating the new data into X-ray burst simulations significantly reduces the abundance uncertainties in the $A$ = 90-100 region, shifting the reaction flow toward $A$ = 90 production and suppressing the synthesis of heavier nuclei.

A key feature of this interaction is the hydrogen wall - secondary interstellar atoms produced via charge exchange near the tangential discontinuity separating the stellar wind from the ionized ISM component. This secondary component is decelerated and heated compared to primary interstellar hydrogen, making the hydrogen wall detectable through Lyman-$α$ absorption spectra toward nearby stars. Such structures have been observed by the Hubble Space Telescope around the Sun and other stars. In this paper, we propose that another feature of the stellar wind/partially ionized ISM interaction may also be detectable in Lyman-$α$ spectra: the neutral stellar wind. It forms via charge exchange between supersonic stellar wind protons and interstellar atoms penetrating deep into the astrosphere due to their long mean free paths. We present a parametric numerical analysis of astrospheric structures and their synthetic Lyman-$α$ absorption spectra. Using a 2D kinetic-hydrodynamic model, we vary the terminal wind velocity while maintaining constant dynamic pressure to keep the astrosphere size consistent. For winds slower than the solar wind (terminal velocities $V_0 \\lesssim 200$ km/s), charge exchange efficiency in the supersonic region increases dramatically, producing a distinct and observable absorption feature from the neutral wind. This signature is negligible for solar-like winds ($V_0 \\approx 400$ km/s) but emerges as a direct spectroscopic diagnostic for winds up to $\\sim 200$ km/s. Detecting this neutral wind absorption offers a novel method to directly constrain stellar wind velocities."}

These observables are sensitive to the matter power spectrum which itself depends on inflationary initial conditions. We consider specific models where a bump or oscillatory features are introduced to the standard power law inflation spectrum. We find that the galaxy luminosity observables can probe such modifications at wavenumbers $0.5\\lesssim k \\lesssim 20$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We obtain upper limits on the amplitude of bump-like features at the mentioned wavenumbers. We obtain constraints which are similar to previous constraints on these models using measurements of optical depth of reionization. However, the galaxy luminosity functions are a more direct probe for these type of models and, therefore, can complement indirect constraints coming from measurements of IGM properties."}

We forward-model 3-D distributions for these tracers from magnetohydrodynamic simulations, directly capturing the two-halo, one-halo, and shot statistics without relying on analytical decompositions. We further detail a signal-to-noise formalism, tailored to LIM surveys with highly anisotropic geometries and Fourier-space coverage.\n  We demonstrate that galaxy cross-correlations will be the dominant discovery channel for current-generation surveys. These instruments will detect the auto-spectra for CO and HI 21 cm and the CO $\\times$ 21 cm cross-spectrum at modest S/N $\\sim 1-10$, while placing upper limits on the [CII]-158$μ$m signals. [CII], CO, and HI LIM will be $\\sim3-30\\times$ ($0.5-1.5$ dex) more sensitive to cross-correlation with the Euclid survey, however, than their respective auto-correlations, constraining all three models of line emission at high significance (S/N $\\sim 10-40$) within this decade.\n  Finally, we formulate a staged instrumental trajectory with planned or reasonable improvements, including the as-proposed SKA-Mid. We forecast advancing the per-$k$-mode sensitivities of each auto-, galaxy-line, and line-line spectrum by several orders of magnitude, enabling new percent- and sub-percent level constraints on cosmology and the redshift evolution of star formation and the baryon cycle."}

Submitted to MNRAS Letters", "summary": "Shock waves generated during cluster mergers offer a powerful probe of how large-scale structure grows and evolves in the Universe. As part of the MeerKAT-South Pole Telescope (SPT) survey, we report the discovery of a single arc-like radio relic in the galaxy cluster Abell 4067 ($z=0.099$), one of the lowest-mass clusters known to host such a structure. MeerKAT UHF-band (0.58--1.09 GHz) observations reveal a relic with a largest linear size of $\\sim 1.48 \\pm 0.02$ Mpc, located at a projected distance of 0.95 Mpc from the cluster centre. XMM-Newton X-ray data show that the relic's position and orientation relative to the intracluster medium (ICM) elongation are consistent with a merger-driven shock-wave scenario. The relic has an estimated radio power of $3.10 \\pm 0.03 \\times 10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 150 MHz. When placed in the $P_{150\\,\\mathrm{MHz}}$--$M_{500}$ scaling relation, the Abell 4067 relic appears less luminous compared to relics in more massive clusters, suggesting an association with weak merger shocks. This finding supports the idea that relics in low-mass clusters may form through less energetic merger events, leading to weak merger shocks. This is further supported by the absence of a detectable central radio halo in Abell 4067, reinforcing the idea that luminous radio halos are not a universal outcome of cluster mergers and highlighting the role of cluster mass, merger energetics, and evolutionary stage in shaping diffuse radio emission in the intracluster medium."}

Continuum fitting", "categories": ["astro-ph.HE", "astro-ph.GA"], "comment": "11 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables, submitted to Astronomy & Astrophysics", "summary": "We present a broadband study of the WLQ SDSS J101353.45+492758.1, which displays a nearly featureless UV-optical spectrum with only a weak Mg II line alongside an exceptionally low X-ray flux. We model its spectral energy distribution using the relativistic thin-disk model kerrbb with a power law, and the multicomponent AGN model relagn, a physically motivated extension of agnsed incorporating warm and hot Comptonizing regions. Our fits constrain the black hole mass, accretion rate, X-ray loudness, and coronal energetics. Both approaches yield consistent BH masses of M_{BH} \\approx 2 \\times 10^{9} M_\\odot and an Eddington accretion rate of \\dot m \\approx 0.1. The relagn fit including a warm Comptonizing region provides a significantly improved representation of the UV-soft X-ray continuum. The warm corona, characterized by kTe \\simeq 0.20 keV, Γ \\simeq 3.8, and an optical depth τ \\simeq 7.26, extends to \\sim 34 R_g. The hot corona appears compact and energetically suppressed, leading to an intrinsically weak X ray output with log(L_{X}/L_{bol}) \\simeq -4.29, among the lowest reported for WLQs. The α_{ox} \\sim 2.06 indicates the source to be in high/soft AGN spectral state. The combination of a luminous, standard disk and extremely weak hot corona suggests that this quasar hosts a highly inefficient inner coronal region. This explains its X-ray faintness and extreme deficit of high-ionization emission lines. The source may represent an AGN analog in \"ultrasoft\" accretion state, or a system in which the ionizing continuum is suppressed by a compact or quenched corona. Our study suggests that the source is not accreting at high Eddington ratio, highlighting the physical diversity of WLQs, and supports the view that geometric and radiative effects jointly shape their extreme spectral properties."}
