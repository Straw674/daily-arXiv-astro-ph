To be submitted to MNRAS. Comments are welcome!", "summary": "Principled Bayesian inference of galaxy properties has not previously been performed for wide-area weak lensing surveys with millions of sources. We address this gap by applying the pop-cosmos generative model to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting for 4 million KiDS-1000 galaxies. Calibrated on deep COSMOS2020 photometric data, pop-cosmos specifies a physically-motivated prior over the galaxy population up to $z \\simeq 6$ in stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameter space. Using the Speculator SPS emulator with GPU-accelerated MCMC sampling, we perform full posterior inference at 6.5 GPU seconds per galaxy, obtaining joint constraints on galaxy redshifts and physical properties. We validate photometric redshifts against $\\sim\\!185,\\!000$ KiDS galaxies cross-matched to DESI DR1 spectroscopic samples, achieving low bias ($3\\times10^{-3}$), scatter ($σ_{\\mathrm{MAD}}=0.04$), and outlier fraction (3.7%) for the Bright Galaxy Survey, with comparable performance (bias $3\\times10^{-2}$, $σ_{\\mathrm{MAD}}=0.05$, 1.3% outliers) for luminous red galaxies (LRGs). Within the LRG sample, we identify massive, dusty, star-forming contaminants at $z \\simeq 0.4$ satisfying standard colour selections for quenched populations. We infer trends in stellar mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust across five tomographic redshift bins consistent with established scaling relations. Using specific star formation rate constraints, we identify $\\sim$10% of KiDS-1000 galaxies as quenched, versus 37% implied by conservative colour cuts. This enables the construction of weak lensing samples defined by physical properties while mitigating intrinsic alignment systematics and preserving statistical power. Our analysis validates pop-cosmos out-of-sample, establishing it as a scaleable approach for galaxy evolution and cosmological analyses in photometric surveys."}

Velocity dispersions, $σ$, can be used to break the degeneracy, with uncertainties $ΔH/H_0 \\propto Δσ^2/σ^2$ ultimately limited by the systematic uncertainties in the kinematic measurements - measuring $H_0$ to 2% requires $Δσ^2/σ^2$ < 2%. Here we explore a broad range of potential systematic uncertainties contributing to eight time-delay lenses used in cosmological analyses. We find that: (1) The characterization of the PSF both in absolute scale and in shape is important, with biases in $Δσ^2/σ^2$ up to 1-6%, depending on the lens system. Small slit miscenterings of the lens are less important. (2) The difference between the measured velocity dispersion and the mean square velocity needed for the Jeans equations is important, with up to $Δσ^2/σ^2 \\sim$ 3-8%. (3) The choice of anisotropy models is important with maximum changes of $Δσ^2/σ^2 \\sim$ 5-18% and the frequently used Osipkov-Merritt models do not produce $h_4$ velocity moments typical of early-type galaxies.

Recent studies suggest a much hotter (~0.7 keV) super-virial component detected in both absorption and emission. We want to shed light on the nature of this putative super-virial component. We analysed the X-ray background as observed by SRG/eROSITA over the entire western Galactic hemisphere. We show that low-mass stars provide a large fraction of the 0.7 keV emission. Indeed, a tight correlation is found between the surface brightness of the 0.7 keV emission and the mass distribution of the Milky Way across a large portion of the western Galactic hemisphere. The correlation coefficient implies an X-ray luminosity per unit of stellar mass comparable to that of the average low-mass stars within 10 pc of the Sun, suggesting that unresolved M dwarfs and F, G, and K type stars dominate the 0.7 keV emission. This emission is asymmetric with respect to the Galactic plane, influenced by the asymmetric distribution of nearby star-forming regions, and broadly consistent with the known offset of the Sun above the Galactic midplane. The remaining signal might be produced by the cumulative emission of stars of different types or ages, in addition to other sources (e.g. hot interstellar medium, Galactic corona, etc.). Assuming that the putative residual hot super-virial atmosphere is homogeneous and has a spherical beta profile with slope $β=0.4$, we constrain its density at 10 kpc to be $n_e<4\\times10^{-4}$~cm$^{-3}$. Our findings may help refine models of the circumgalactic medium around external galaxies, advancing our understanding of hot baryon flows and galaxy evolution."}

The stellar IMF may directly result from a Core Mass Function (CMF) through accretion, gravitational collapse, and fragmentation. This inheritance implies that the mass of the gaseous fragments may be connected to the properties of clustered and multiple stellar systems. We aim to (i) quantify the influence of hierarchical fragmentation of cores on the resulting IMF, and (ii) determine the consequences of this fragmentation on the multiplicity of the stellar systems. We employed a scale-free, hierarchical fragmentation model to investigate the fragmentation of top-heavy CMF. Hierarchical fragmentation of gas clumps shifts the CMF towards lower mass range and can modify its shape. Starting from the top-heavy power-law CMF observed in W43-MM2&MM3 star forming region, we show that at least four levels of hierarchical fragmentation are required to generate the turn-over peak of the cIMF. Within a radius of 0.2-2.5 kAU, massive stars (M > 10 Msun) have on average 0.9 companions, five times fewer than low-mass stars (M < 0.1 Msun); the latter are less dynamically stable and should disperse. We show that a universal IMF can emerge from mass-dependent fragmentation processes provided that more massive cores produce less fragments compared to lower mass cores and transfer their mass less efficiently to their fragments. Hierarchical fragmentation alone cannot reconcile a universal IMF with observed stellar multiplicity. We propose that fragmentation is not scale-free but operates in two distinct regimes: a mass-dependent phase establishing the Salpeter slope and a mass-independent phase setting the turn-over. Our framework provides a way to compare core subfragmentation in various star-forming regions and numerical simulations."}

This work seeks to better understand their possible chemical connections, with a focus on such molecules in the sources of the star-forming region Sgr B2 (N). The gas-phase reaction between ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and the halogens fluorine and chlorine was investigated via DFT calculations, with the goal of determining whether astrochemically viable chemical pathways leading to acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) exist. The studied reactions were then included in an astrochemical model of Sgr B2 (N) to determine their significance under real interstellar conditions. Our DFT calculations revealed that both chlorine and fluorine can react barrierlessly with ethanol to abstract a hydrogen atom. We further found that, following this initial step, the resulting ethanol radicals can undergo further reactions with atomic hydrogen, with some routes leading to acetaldehyde. Incorporation of these novel reactions in astrochemical models of hot cores suggest that they are indeed efficient under those conditions, and can lead to modest increases in the abundance of CH3CHO during model times where gas-phase ethanol is abundant. Of the ethanol radicals included in our chemical network, we found CH3CHOH to have the highest abundances in our simulations comparable to that of ethanol at some model times. Overall, this work reveals a novel gas-phase ``top-down'' link from alcohols to aldehydes that compliments the better studied ``bottom-up'' routes involving grain-surface H-addition reactions yielding alcohols from aldehydes. Moreover, results from our astrochemical models suggest that the ethanol radical CH3CHOH may be detectable in the interstellar medium."}

Integrating its predictions over box-scale overdensity and an extended reionization history allows the emulator to predict the global MFP.

An emergent underlying trend is that this Hubble tension is driven by data confined to the very low-redshift Universe (typically $z < 0.15$). Most intermediate-redshift measurements remain mutually consistent with $H_0^\\mathrm{CMB}$, the $Λ$CDM expectation anchored by the CMB. This Perspective examines if a large local void can explain the Hubble tension and its appearance only at low $z$. For an observer residing within a large underdensity, such as the Milky Way inside the claimed KBC void, gravitationally induced outflows and redshift can inflate the locally inferred recession scale $cz'$ despite having $H_0 = H_0^\\mathrm{CMB}$. We summarise evidence suggestive of a local underdensity from multi-wavelength galaxy number counts, discuss the dynamical requirements implied by the amplitude of inferred bulk flows, and connect the solution to the emerging low-redshift BAO distance anomaly ($α_{\\mathrm{iso}} < 1$). Previously published semi-analytic void models anticipated the observed redshift dependence of BAO deviations and predict a rapid convergence to CMB-consistent expansion for $z \\gtrsim 0.2$, aligning with reconstructions of $H_0(z)$ from BAO plus uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae. We conclude by looking to future tests, including improved mapping of the local density and velocity field, fits to galaxy distance catalogues at the field level, kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich constraints on coherent outflows, fast radio bursts, and the long-term prospect of redshift drift measurements as a direct probe of time-varying non-cosmological redshift contributions."}

J", "summary": "We present a joint test of cosmic curvature, $Ω_{k0}$, and the cosmic distance-duality relation (CDDR) using the Etherington relation, which connects the luminosity and angular diameter distances at the same redshift. In this work, we combine the angular diameter distance measurements from recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) observations with luminosity distances reconstructed from Cosmic Chronometers data of Hubble parameter $H(z)$ using a non-parametric technique, Gaussian Process. A key part of our analysis is the systematic comparison of different BAO measurements (2D BAO, 3D BAO, and 3D DESI BAO) to determine whether any potential tension between angular and anisotropic BAO data affects constraints on the distance duality parameter $η(z)$ and $Ω_{k0}$. We adopt four representative parameterizations of $η(z)$ to examine the correlation between $η(z)$ and $Ω_{k0}$. Our results show no evidence for violation of the CDDR, with $η(z)$ consistent with unity at the 99\\% confidence level for all BAO datasets and parameterizations. In all scenarios, the best-fit values of $Ω_{k0}$ mildly favor a non-flat universe, although a spatially flat universe remains compatible at the 95\\% confidence level. The constraints on $η_1$ and $Ω_{k0}$ indicate slight variations across different BAO datasets, but the discrepancies between the 2D and 3D BAO measurements do not introduce any significant bias, and no statistically meaningful tension is observed. Our work provides robust constraints on cosmic curvature and the validity of the CDDR based on non-parametric distance reconstruction."}

We apply an adaptive kernel-density estimation method that incorporates the full photometric redshift probability distribution function of each galaxy to map galaxy overdensities, and identify 207 significant ($>4\\,σ$) overdensities at $1.5<z<5$. We measure the quenched-galaxy fraction, the median specific star formation rate (sSFR), the total halo mass, and the local galaxy density of each system. By investigating the correlation among these observables, we find that galaxy quenching proceeds in two paths:($i$) Overdensities within more massive halos exhibit higher quenched fractions and lower averaged sSFRs. This trend weakens at $z\\gtrsim2$, consistent with cold gas streams penetrating shock-heated massive halos and sustaining star formation activity at early times. ($ii$) We also find a dependence of the same parameters on local densities at $z<2$, where the quenched fraction increases and the sSFR decreases toward higher densities. The environmental trend in sSFR weakens at $z\\sim2$--$3$ and shows tentative evidence for a reversal at $z>3$, potentially due to a larger cold gas supply in earlier times. Our study reveals a complex interplay between individual galaxies and large-scale environmental properties, marking the onset of environmental effects on galaxy quenching in massive halos at cosmic noon."}

Comments welcome, ideally before submission to Discover Space by 12th February 2026", "summary": "The inconsistency between the locally inferred Hubble constant and the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background assuming the $Λ$CDM cosmological model has persisted, turning into an important problem. An emergent underlying trend is that this Hubble tension is driven by data confined to the very low-redshift Universe (typically $z < 0.15$). Most intermediate-redshift measurements remain mutually consistent with $H_0^\\mathrm{CMB}$, the $Λ$CDM expectation anchored by the CMB. This Perspective examines if a large local void can explain the Hubble tension and its appearance only at low $z$. For an observer residing within a large underdensity, such as the Milky Way inside the claimed KBC void, gravitationally induced outflows and redshift can inflate the locally inferred recession scale $cz'$ despite having $H_0 = H_0^\\mathrm{CMB}$. We summarise evidence suggestive of a local underdensity from multi-wavelength galaxy number counts, discuss the dynamical requirements implied by the amplitude of inferred bulk flows, and connect the solution to the emerging low-redshift BAO distance anomaly ($α_{\\mathrm{iso}} < 1$). Previously published semi-analytic void models anticipated the observed redshift dependence of BAO deviations and predict a rapid convergence to CMB-consistent expansion for $z \\gtrsim 0.2$, aligning with reconstructions of $H_0(z)$ from BAO plus uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae. We conclude by looking to future tests, including improved mapping of the local density and velocity field, fits to galaxy distance catalogues at the field level, kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich constraints on coherent outflows, fast radio bursts, and the long-term prospect of redshift drift measurements as a direct probe of time-varying non-cosmological redshift contributions."}

The proposed mechanism made use of a tachyonic resonance channel which leads to the exponential amplification of infrared modes. Here, we first investigate a possible narrow band parametric resonance channel which can produce photons at higher frequencies. Secondly, we estimate the effects of back-reaction on terminating the resonance. We find that there is indeed a narrow resonance channel. It is characterized by a Floquet exponent which is slightly smaller than the corresponding exponent for the tachyonic resonance. However, there is a region of parameter space (corresponding to a very small coupling constant) for which the tachyonic resonance is ineffective. In this case, the narrow resonance will dominate, and it will still be sufficiently strong to generate the observed magnetic fields on cosmological scales. Our analytical treatment of the back-reaction effects considered here indicates that a fraction of order one of the initial dark matter density can flow into the gauge fields. Hence, our magnetogenesis scenario appears to be robust to back-reaction effects."}

Our results indicate that HNSO is efficiently produced on grain surfaces through reactions involving atomic oxygen and nitrogen atoms with the radicals NS and SO, forming NSO as a key intermediate. Subsequent hydrogenation of NSO leads to HNSO, with a clear preference for the lowest energy cis conformer, while the trans form is metastable and may be short-lived under typical interstellar conditions. The models predict that solid HNSO can reach abundances comparable to icy OCS, placing it among the major sulfur-bearing species in interstellar ices. Gas-phase abundances, in contrast, remain lower than those of OCS. The implementation of a multibinding scheme in our models clarifies the role of diffusive chemistry in the production of HNSO at early times, improving agreement with observations. These findings suggest that reactions involving diffusing O and N atoms on icy grains contribute significantly to sulfur chemistry and beyond in dense clouds and motivate further searches for molecules containing simultaneously H, N, O and S in other astronomical environments."}

The recommendations are directed primarily to degree-granting departments and the American Astronomical Society, as the principal relevant professional organization, though we earnestly invite all members of the Astronomy and Astrophysics community to contribute to a broader discussion about these findings and recommendations. Appendix A of the report contains detailed descriptions of survey data analyses. Appendices B and C contain recommended undergraduate course requirements and learning goals, respectively. Our survey results show clearly that there is not currently community consensus about what knowledge and competencies an undergraduate Astronomy or Astrophysics degree should instill. This lack of cohesion is a problem for our community, as it dilutes the significance and interpretability of the credential for employers and graduate schools.

The trend persists for dark-matter halos or galaxies that are more closely related to the observables. We investigate the impact of the finite simulation box sizes on the measured velocity correlation functions of halos, utilizing N-body simulations with different box sizes. We measure the halo velocity correlations from N-body simulations with side lengths of $1{\\rm Gpc}/h$ and $2{\\rm Gpc}/h$, confirming the former is more suppressed compared to the linear theory prediction on large scales due to the lack of large-scale modes beyond the box size. In contrast, even though we subdivide the larger-box simulations into those with side lengths of $1{\\rm Gpc}/h$, the amount of the suppression is the same as that from the original boxes, as the large-scale modes are already imprinted. Introducing the lower limit of the integral in the Hankel transform, $k_{\\rm min}$, as a free parameter and marginalizing it over, we find that the constrained growth rate parameter, $f(z)σ_8(z)$, returns the correct value assumed in the simulations. However, when we ignore the effect and set $k_{\\rm min}=0$, the constraint on $fσ_8$ is significantly biased if the correlation between different separation bins is also ignored. Furthermore, we find that the suppression of the velocity correlation amplitude on large scales depends on halo mass, with more massive halos exhibiting a systematically stronger suppression. These results highlight the importance of accounting for missing long-wavelength modes when developing simulation-based modeling of velocity statistics, such as emulators."}

They are driven by a resonant interaction between streaming dust and waves in a background medium, which results in dust density fluctuations and amplification of the waves. This broad class of instabilities includes recently-proposed modes incorporating acoustic and magnetohydrodynamic waves, as well as the well-studied disk streaming instability. As the study of RDIs is at an early stage, their evolution beyond the linear regime is not well understood. In order to make inroads into the nonlinear theory of RDIs, we performed simulations of the simplest case, the acoustic RDI, in which sound waves in a gas are amplified by interaction with supersonically streaming dust. This particular instability is of interest both due its potential relevance in various poorly ionized environments, and due to its resemblance to the fast magnetosonic RDI. We find that the nonlinear growth and saturation of the instability are characterized by a balance between time scales of instability growth and turbulent eddy turnover. The simulations demonstrate a saturated state possessing an anisotropic outer forcing range in which this balance is maintained, and suggest the presence of an isotropic turbulent inertial range below this scale. By presenting a model for the nonlinear growth and saturated state of the acoustic RDI, this work provides a framework for further study of the nonlinear behavior of this and other RDIs."}

The low-multipole convergence field, encodes the largest-angle coherent potential gradients, essential for assessment of large-angle features in data. To study this large angle signal, we perform a combined analytical, numerical and observational study. Starting from exact analytical expressions for the convergence power spectrum, we quantify how the dipole, quadrupole and octupole build up with source redshift and show that, in $Λ$CDM, they saturate at an amplitude of order $10^{-4}$. We then use full-sky, horizon-scale $N$-body simulations (Quijote) to explore the dependence of this signal on the observer's environment, comparing random observers to ``Milky Way-like'' observers. In parallel, we reconstruct the convergence field due to our local Universe with the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS), with proper treatment of incompleteness and galaxy bias. We find that the observed low multipoles from observation is above the $Λ$CDM mean predictions, but in full agreement with Milky Way-like observers in the simulation. Finally, by converting the convergence dipole into a number-count dipole, we test whether weak lensing can contribute to the cosmic dipole anomaly, an idea motivated by its natural alignment with the CMB dipole and by the fact that lensing, unlike clustering, cannot be removed by cross-matching surveys and thus survives in all high-redshift catalogues. We show that weak lensing by local structure contributes at most a few percent to this observed anomaly."}

It reached the maximum light at about 27~d after the explosion and the light curve shows a broad, luminous peak with an absolute $r$-band magnitude of $M_{r} = -18.48 \\pm 0.16$~mag. At about 50~d after maximum light, SN~2017ati exhibits a decline rate close to that expected from the $^{56}$Co $\\rightarrow$ $^{56}$Fe radioactive decay, at 0.98 mag per 100 days, as usually observed in SNe IIb. However, it remains systematically brighter at late times by about 1--2~mag, exceeding the usual upper luminosity range of this class. As a result, modelling the light curve of SN~2017ati with a standard $^{56}$Ni decay scenario requires a large nickel mass of up to $\\sim0.37\\,M_{\\odot}$ and still fails to reproduce the early-time light curve adequately. In contrast, incorporating additional energy input from a magnetar yields a significantly improved fit to the light curve of SN~2017ati, which would reduce the nickel mass to $\\sim0.21\\,M_{\\odot}$, still close to the upper end of the range typically inferred for SNe~IIb. Comparing the fitted results of SN~2017ati with the known sample of SNe~IIb indicates that its luminosity evolution is best explained by a combination of neutron star spin-down energy and radioactive nickel deposition. From late-time nebular spectra of SN~2017ati, the luminosity of the [\\Oi]~$λ\\lambda6300,6364$ doublet implies an oxygen mass of $\\sim1.82-3.34\\,M_{\\odot}$, and the combination of a [\\Caii]/[\\Oi] flux ratio of $\\sim0.5$ with nebular spectral model comparisons favours a progenitor zero-age main-sequence mass of $\\geq17\\,M_{\\odot}$."}

Comparing results with its dominant-mode-only counterpart SEOBNRv5E, we find no statistically significant HOM-induced bias in eccentricity for any of these events, including GW190521, whose eccentricity has been debated in the literature. To identify parameter regimes vulnerable to HOM omission, we perform a broad zero-noise injection campaign varying detector-frame total mass, mass ratio, eccentricity, inclination, and network SNR. We find that significant systematic biases ($Δ_e/σ> 1$) arise predominantly in systems with high total mass ($M^{\\rm det}\\gtrsim120M_\\odot$), highly asymmetric mass ratios ($q \\gtrsim 4$), near edge-on orientations ($θ_\\textrm{JN} \\gtrsim 30^\\circ$), and high SNRs ($ρ^N_\\textrm{mf}\\approx50$). Notably, for quasi-circular BBHs with $M^{\\rm det}\\gtrsim140M_\\odot$, neglecting HOMs may lead to strong false-positive evidence for nonzero eccentricity. By contrast, for lower-mass systems ($M^{\\rm det}\\sim100 M_\\odot$), HOM exclusion produces negligible eccentricity biases.

However, we note that standard sirens do not offer a viable resolution to the Hubble tension in this analysis, as the inferred constraints are predominantly driven by the fiducial cosmologies adopted in the simulations. Regarding the specific models, we find that for the Hu-Sawicki scenario, several data combinations favor $F_{RR0}<0$, implying potential theoretical instabilities. And, for the Starobinsky model, while EM-only constraints are nearly symmetric between the two parameter branches ($b<0$ and $b>0$), the inclusion of SS constraints introduces mild asymmetries, revealing the sensitivity of SS observables to the curvature dependence of the theory.

The trend persists for dark-matter halos or galaxies that are more closely related to the observables. We investigate the impact of the finite simulation box sizes on the measured velocity correlation functions of halos, utilizing N-body simulations with different box sizes. We measure the halo velocity correlations from N-body simulations with side lengths of $1{\\rm Gpc}/h$ and $2{\\rm Gpc}/h$, confirming the former is more suppressed compared to the linear theory prediction on large scales due to the lack of large-scale modes beyond the box size. In contrast, even though we subdivide the larger-box simulations into those with side lengths of $1{\\rm Gpc}/h$, the amount of the suppression is the same as that from the original boxes, as the large-scale modes are already imprinted. Introducing the lower limit of the integral in the Hankel transform, $k_{\\rm min}$, as a free parameter and marginalizing it over, we find that the constrained growth rate parameter, $f(z)σ_8(z)$, returns the correct value assumed in the simulations. However, when we ignore the effect and set $k_{\\rm min}=0$, the constraint on $fσ_8$ is significantly biased if the correlation between different separation bins is also ignored. Furthermore, we find that the suppression of the velocity correlation amplitude on large scales depends on halo mass, with more massive halos exhibiting a systematically stronger suppression. These results highlight the importance of accounting for missing long-wavelength modes when developing simulation-based modeling of velocity statistics, such as emulators."}

It had been proposed that unclustered tracers (with bias $b_1=0$) could be optimal for PNG studies, and that these could be found by selecting galaxies in bins of their local density. Here, we test this hypothesis in state-of-the-art simulations from the PNG-UNITsim suite with local $f_{\\rm NL}=100$ and $f_{\\rm NL}=-20$. We consider different parent tracer catalogues: all halos together, halos in large mass bins, and HOD models for LRGs and QSO. We then classify these tracers by their local density ($δ_{t,R}$) and measure the linear bias ($b_1$) and PNG-response ($b_φ$). Most $δ_{t,R}$ bins show a PNG-response compatible with $b_φ=0$ for all halos or the low-mass bin (log$M<11$). For high-mass halos (log$M>$12), QSO or LRG, we recover a trend closer to the universality relation ($b_φ= 2 δ_{\\rm crit}(b_1-1)$) for $b_1>1$, but the $b_φ(b_1)$ curve flattens to 0 below $\\vert b_1\\lvert<1$. Hence, we find $b_φ\\approx0$ for all bias-zero tracers considered.

It is debated if all massive stars undergo an LBV-like phase during their evolution, or instead LBVs are exotic phenomena. We aim to quantify the incidence of LBV-like variability in the blue supergiant (BSgs) population of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the OGLE survey. Here, we extend previous work in the Small Magellanic Cloud to the LMC, where we examine the light curves of 87 B Supergiants (BSgs) (out of 254 known BSgs) spanning timescales of twenty years, and 37 objects across a three year timescale for aperiodic variations resembling known S Dor variables. One blue supergiant, [ST92] 4-13 shows S Dor type photometric variations. New spectra of this object reveals a potential change in spectral type compared to the literature classification. However, based on its spectral characteristics and low luminosity and mass, we do not currently classify it as an LBV. Our study highlights the need to classify bona fide LBVs as stars undergoing both photometric and spectroscopic variations. Based on currently known stellar population of S Dor variables in the LMC, the lifetime of the S Dor phase is at most $\\sim$10$^3$ yrs, in agreement with our duty cycle study based on OGLE data in the SMC. This is orders of magnitude shorter than assumed in literature. Our discovery of LBV-like variability at low luminosities may suggest that S Dor variations could arise from Eddington limit related physics over a wide range of stellar masses, rather than being linked to a unique evolutionary stage."}

Wide binaries offer a unique opportunity to test gravity in the low acceleration regime, where deviations from Newtonian dynamics may appear. Aims. We use high-resolution VLT-ESPRESSO archival spectra to study 26 wide binaries with projected separations larger than 13,000 AU. By combining precise radial velocities with Gaia proper motions and parallaxes, we aim to test whether these systems are consistent with Newtonian gravity in the low acceleration regime. Methods. We use multiple radial velocity measurements and stellar parameters to remove systems affected by unresolved triples, chance alignments, or young systems. For the remaining binaries, we combine radial velocities (corrected for convective shift and gravitational redshift) with Gaia proper motions, parallaxes, and positions to attempt bound Newtonian orbital solutions Results. Fourteen of the 26 initial systems were discarded: 12 due to radial velocity variability indicating unresolved close binaries, one hosting a faint Gaia companion, and one too young. Of the remaining 12, nine can be fitted with bound orbital solution, while three show velocity differences too large to be reconciled with any bound Newtonian orbit. Conclusions. For the three systems that cannot be fitted with a bound orbit, repeated radial velocity observations allow us to confidently exclude, with one possible exception, unresolved triple stellar companions or massive close-in planets as causes. Given their likely large 3-dimensional separations, these binaries may have been dynamically perturbed or disrupted by stellar encounters or Galactic tides, and may no longer be gravitationally bound.

We detected 27 H$_2$ emission lines tracing a narrow, cone-shaped structure within the outflow cavity. A high-velocity ionized jet is detected in several forbidden atomic lines, characterized by a position angle of 142\\degree, an opening angle of 1.4\\degree, and an estimated geometric launching radius of at most $\\sim$40\\,au. Mid-infrared CO ro-vibrational emission lines, stronger in the P-branch, show a similar distribution to the H$_2$ emission and are likely to originate from hot gas within the outflow cavity. CO and C$_2$H emission lines detected by ALMA trace slower, colder outflow components and cavity walls. The spatial and kinematic stratification between the hot atomic and molecular components and the colder molecular gas is consistent with predictions from MHD disk wind models, although envelope material entrained by a wide-angle wind or jet may also contribute. Our analysis highlights the powerful synergy between JWST and ALMA in advancing the understanding of protostellar jets and outflows across multiple spatial and physical scales."}

Coupling to the time-independent component of the charge density instead generates a quadrupolar scalar field profile, which may influence the orbital dynamics of binary systems. Such scalars can also interact with the time-varying electromagnetic fields of magnetized stars, modifying photon propagation and inducing observable effects in the redshift and residual time-delay measurements, as well as corrections to the background electromagnetic fields. We investigate these phenomena for the Crab pulsar, SGR 1806-20, and GRB 080805A. Using spectral and timing observations, we derive constraints on the scalar-electron and scalar-photon couplings. While the bounds obtained on the scalar-electron coupling from pulsar spin-down are weaker than existing limits, electromagnetic radiation measurements yield the strongest astrophysical constraints to date on the scalar-photon coupling. Compact stars with stronger surface magnetic fields and observations at lower photon frequencies can improve these bounds by several orders of magnitude."}

In this paper we examine the orbital elements of particles in the restricted three-body problem prior to and post scattering onto hyperbolic trajectories by massive perturbers. Building on previous work, we calculate closed-form -- but approximate -- analytic criteria that map pre- to post-encounter orbital elements. An application of these equations demonstrates that ejection occurs most efficiently when the orbital eccentricity of the massless test particle exceeds a minimum threshold, $e\\gtrsim0.4$. The primary driver of the final eccentricity is the component of the perturber-centric velocity projected along the direction of motion of the perturber. These analytic criteria are then benchmarked and validated against numerical simulations which demonstrate that they provide a reasonably good zeroth-order approximation for ejection behavior. However, system-specific cases will generally require numerical simulations in addition to this analytic construction. The methodology is applied to (i) the solar system and exoplanetary systems (ii) $β$ Pictoris and (iii) HR 8799 to evaluate the pre-scattering orbits of ejected particles. This method provides a transparent and computationally efficient tool for identifying orbits within a given system from which interstellar objects are efficiently ejected via a single scattering event from a massive perturber."}

Using Bayesian inference with the state-of-the-art eccentric, spin-aligned, higher-mode effective-one-body model SEOBNRv5EHM, we reanalyze six previously suggested eccentric gravitational-wave events--GW190521, GW190620, GW190701, GW191109, GW200129, and GW200208\\_222617. Comparing results with its dominant-mode-only counterpart SEOBNRv5E, we find no statistically significant HOM-induced bias in eccentricity for any of these events, including GW190521, whose eccentricity has been debated in the literature. To identify parameter regimes vulnerable to HOM omission, we perform a broad zero-noise injection campaign varying detector-frame total mass, mass ratio, eccentricity, inclination, and network SNR. We find that significant systematic biases ($Δ_e/σ> 1$) arise predominantly in systems with high total mass ($M^{\\rm det}\\gtrsim120M_\\odot$), highly asymmetric mass ratios ($q \\gtrsim 4$), near edge-on orientations ($θ_\\textrm{JN} \\gtrsim 30^\\circ$), and high SNRs ($ρ^N_\\textrm{mf}\\approx50$). Notably, for quasi-circular BBHs with $M^{\\rm det}\\gtrsim140M_\\odot$, neglecting HOMs may lead to strong false-positive evidence for nonzero eccentricity. By contrast, for lower-mass systems ($M^{\\rm det}\\sim100 M_\\odot$), HOM exclusion produces negligible eccentricity biases. Our results demonstrate that although current eccentric candidates are not impacted by HOM omission, future eccentricity measurements--particularly for massive, asymmetric, or edge-on systems--require HOM-inclusive waveforms to avoid substantial systematic errors."}

Expanding the CP asymmetry parameter near degeneracy and imposing the conservative non-resonance condition that the mass splitting must be much greater than the right-handed neutrino decay rates $ΔM > 100Γ_i$, yields the universal upper bound $ε\\leq 1/200$, independent of both the effective neutrino masses and the right-handed neutrino mass. We investigate vanilla and flavoured near-resonant leptogenesis and find that successful leptogenesis by right-handed neutrino decays can occur for $M \\gtrsim 100~\\mathrm{GeV}$ independent of washout regime, extending the viable parameter space of thermal leptogenesis down to the electroweak scale without invoking resonance. We also analyse near-resonant thermal leptogenesis during reheating and show that successful baryon asymmetry generation is compatible with reheating temperatures as low as $T_{RH}\\simeq 10\\rm GeV$ without relying on non-thermal production. Finally, we present a consistent framework for incorporating flavour effects in near-resonant leptogenesis during reheating. Overall, near-resonant thermal leptogenesis offers a controlled alternative regime to resonant leptogenesis, lowering the leptogenesis scale to the electroweak scale, without reliance on a disputed regulator used in resonant leptogenesis."}

However, primordial black holes (PBHs) can evaporate via Hawking radiation to particles whose energies are set by the black hole temperature. Consequently, weakly interacting light dark matter (or dark radiation) particles produced in this manner can reach the Earth with sufficient flux and kinetic energy above the experimental thresholds. This opens up a novel avenue to probe the light dark sector in terrestrial experiments. In this work, we explore this possibility by considering fermionic DM produced through PBH evaporation and investigate its electron recoil signatures in direct detection experiments. We analyze both energy independent (constant) and energy dependent (scalar and vector mediated) DM-electron interactions, highlighting the strong dependence of the recoil spectra on the underlying Lorentz structure of the interaction. In addition, we also account for the attenuation effects due to loss of kinetic energy while DM traverses through Earth's crust, which can significantly modify the incoming DM flux. Incorporating these effects carefully, we place constraints on light DM using the electron recoil data from XENONnT, LZ, and PandaX-4T. Finally, we also discuss the detection prospects of such dark matter in current and future generation neutrino detectors, such as Super Kamiokande and Hyper Kamiokande."}
