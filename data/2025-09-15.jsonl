Offset MBHs can be observationally traced if they\nare accreting and detectable as spatially offset active galactic nuclei (AGN).\nIn this work, we build the largest uniform sample of spatially offset AGN\ncandidates (328) by matching sources from the Very Large Array Sky Survey\n(VLASS) to galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).

The offset\nAGN occupation fraction is positively correlated with host galaxy stellar mass,\nconsistent with predictions that most offset MBHs will reside in massive halos.\nHowever, this trend vanishes, and may reverse, at the lowest stellar masses,\npotentially reflecting the weaker host galaxy gravitational potentials. The\noffset AGN occupation fraction shows no significant evolution with orbital\nradius, and the agreement with predictions suggests a binary MBH formation rate\nof <0.5 per merger. Finally, for offset MBHs down to masses of 10^5 Solar\nmasses, the occupation fraction is ~30-70 times lower than the expected value\nassuming all accreted satellites host a MBH.

The infrared\nemission is dominated by a torus-like dust structure composed of the highly\nmagnetized, turbulence-supported outer accretion disk and of accreting gas\ntidally torn from the interstellar medium (ISM). At these early stages, the AGN\nis buried and Compton-thick. The near- to mid-IR escaping luminosity varies by\nalmost an order of magnitude across sightlines, largely due to extinction from\nthe inflowing stream of cold dust. Self-absorption within the torus suppresses\nsilicate emission features, and further reprocessing by the ambient ISM leads\nto prominent silicate absorption and colder IR emission. The sublimation\nstructure is stratified by composition and size, producing sightline-dependent\nextinction curves that intrinsically vary in shape. However, after repeated\nscattering in the optically thick dusty medium, these curves emerge\nsubstantially grayed. We also demonstrate that bipolar outflows from the\ncentral black hole that carve biconical cavities and reveal the central engine\nin later stages can preserve IR anisotropy and silicate features.

In\nearly-type galaxies (ETGs), the formation of these PNe is enigmatic; the\npopulation is typically too old to form the expected $M^*$ PNe from single star\nevolution. We aim to give a solution to this problem. We selected five ETGs\nwith known MUSE-PNLF distances. The MUSE instrument allows us to calculate the\nPNLF and consistently investigate the underlying stellar populations. Using\nstellar population synthesis, we derive the population age, star formation\nhistory, metallicity, and alpha abundance. We compare these parameters to the\nPNLF variables: $M^*$ and luminosity-specific PN number at the top 0.5 mag of\nthe PNLF ($\\alpha_{0.5}$). We also compare our results with PNe In Cosmological\nSimulations (PICS) model applied to Magneticum Pathfinder analogue galaxies.\nThe average mass-weighted ages and metallicities of our observations are\ntypically old ($9 <\\mathrm{Age}< 13.5$ Gyr) and rather metal-rich ($-0.4\n<\\mathrm{[M/H]}< +0.2$). We find $M^*$ to be independent of age and metallicity\nin these ages and metallicity intervals. We discover a positive correlation\nbetween $\\alpha_{0.5}$ values and the mass fraction of stellar population ages\nof 2--10 Gyr, implying that most of the PNe originate from stars with\nintermediate ages. Similar trends are also found in the PICS analogue galaxies.\nWe show that the presence of at least $\\sim 2\\%$ of stellar mass younger than\n10 Gyr is, in principle, sufficient to form the $M^*$ PNe in ETGs. We also\npresent observing requirements for an ideal PNLF distance determination in\nETGs."}

We introduce\nMean-Field Independent Component Analysis (MFICA) to decompose quasar spectra\nand obtain recent star formation histories of their host galaxies. Applying\nMFICA to quasar spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7 Quasar\nCatalogue in the redshift range $0.16 \\leq z \\leq 0.76$, we find that 53 per\ncent of quasar host galaxies are star-forming, 17 per cent lie in the\ngreen-valley, while only 5 per cent are quiescent.

Addition to that, we consider\nthe case where PBH abundance is scarce and there is no early PBH domination\ntaking place. On the DM side, we assume a fraction of the population is\nproduced from PBH evaporation, while the remaining part is the regular cold\ndark matters (CDMs) which is produced by some genesis processes that decouples\nlater on. Therefore, in the rest of the cosmological history, DM interacts\nsolely through gravity. Under this condition, there is no thermal equilibrium\never established between DM and SM plasma. An important feature in our analysis\nis that, for the light PBH we consider, its temperature is much larger than the\nmass of DM which is consequently produced ultra-relativistically and require a\nprotracted time to become matter-like. In this context, even though PBH\nevaporates in the very early Universe, PBH-produced DM could still be energetic\nand smooth out the small scale structure at much later time.

Typical\ngrain models assume a compact dust core which becomes covered in a thick ice\nmantle in cold dense environments. In contrast, less compact cores are likely\nto exhibit porosity, leading to a pronounced increase in surface area with\nconcomitant much thinner ice films and higher accessibility to the bare grain\nsurface. Several laboratory experimental and theoretical studies have shown\nthat this type of dust structure can have a marked effect on several\nphysico-chemical processes, including adsorption, desorption, mobility, and\nreactivity of chemical species. Porous grains are thus thought to likely play a\nparticularly important and wide-ranging astrochemical role. Herein, we clarify\nwhat is meant by porosity in relation to grains and grain agglomerates, assess\nthe likely astrochemical effects of porosity and ask whether a fractal/porous\nstructural/morphological description of dust grains is appropriate from an\nastronomical perspective. We provide evidence for high porosity from laboratory\nexperiments and computational simulations of grains and their growth in various\nastrophysical environments.

The infrared\nemission is dominated by a torus-like dust structure composed of the highly\nmagnetized, turbulence-supported outer accretion disk and of accreting gas\ntidally torn from the interstellar medium (ISM). At these early stages, the AGN\nis buried and Compton-thick. The near- to mid-IR escaping luminosity varies by\nalmost an order of magnitude across sightlines, largely due to extinction from\nthe inflowing stream of cold dust. Self-absorption within the torus suppresses\nsilicate emission features, and further reprocessing by the ambient ISM leads\nto prominent silicate absorption and colder IR emission. The sublimation\nstructure is stratified by composition and size, producing sightline-dependent\nextinction curves that intrinsically vary in shape. However, after repeated\nscattering in the optically thick dusty medium, these curves emerge\nsubstantially grayed. We also demonstrate that bipolar outflows from the\ncentral black hole that carve biconical cavities and reveal the central engine\nin later stages can preserve IR anisotropy and silicate features.

Understanding\nintrinsic star cluster populations of dwarf galaxies is particularly important\ngiven their role in the hierarchical growth of larger systems. Using Euclid\nEarly Release Observation data, we study star clusters in two star-forming\ndwarf irregulars in the Local Group, NGC 6822 and IC 10 [$M_\\star \\sim$ (1--4)\n$\\times10^8 M_\\odot$]. With Euclid, clusters are resolved into individual stars\nacross the main bodies and haloes of both galaxies. Visual inspection of $I_E$\nimages uncovers 30 new cluster candidates in NGC 6822 and 16 in IC 10, from\ncompact to extended clusters. We re-evaluate literature candidates, producing\ncombined catalogues of 52 (NGC 6822) and 71 (IC 10) clusters with\nconfidence-based classifications. We present homogeneous photometry in $I_E$,\n$Y_E$, $J_E$, $H_E$, and archival UBVRI data, alongside size measurements and\nproperties from BAGPIPES SED fitting. Synthetic cluster injection shows our\nsample is $\\sim 50$% complete to $M \\lesssim 10^3 M_\\odot$ for ages $\\lesssim\n100$ Myr, and to $M \\lesssim 3\\times10^4 M_\\odot$ for $\\sim 10$ Gyr. IC 10 has\nmore young clusters than NGC 6822, extending to higher masses, consistent with\nits starburst nature. Both dwarfs host several old massive ($\\gtrsim 10^5\nM_\\odot$) clusters, including an exceptional $1.3 \\times 10^6 M_\\odot$ cluster\nin NGC 6822's outskirts. In NGC 6822, we identify a previously undetected, old,\nextended cluster ($R_h = 12.4 \\pm 0.11$ pc). Using well-defined criteria, we\nidentify 11 candidate GCs in NGC 6822 and eight in IC 10. Both galaxies have\nhigh specific frequencies ($S_N$) but remain consistent with known GC scaling\nrelations at low luminosity."}

If present, these variations could yield valuable\ninsights into galaxy formation mechanisms, halo assembly processes, and the\ninfluence of external factors on cosmic structure. We aim to test whether\nsecondary trends in the HOD driven by the large-scale structure of the Universe\nare detectable observationally. In particular, we examine whether the HOD\ndepends on distance to key features of the cosmic web by explicitly quantifying\nthese spatial relationships. We also analyze whether HODs vary across different\ncosmic environments, defined by critical point classifications, and assess the\ninfluence of intrinsic galaxy properties such as central galaxy color. We\ncreate volume-limited galaxy samples from SDSS-DR18 and use a group catalog to\ndetermine halo masses and identify central and satellite membership.\nAdditionally, we employ a DisPerSE catalog to locate critical points such as\nmaxima, minima, and filaments in the cosmic web. We evaluate how the HOD varies\nwith proximity to these features and across five distinct cosmic environments.\nWe further examine trends related to the color of central galaxies and test the\nrobustness of our results with alternative DisPerSE catalogs generated using\ndifferent smoothing scales and persistence thresholds. Our analysis shows that\nlarge-scale environments only weakly influence the HOD. However, second-order\ndependencies may be revealed through a multivariate approach that combines\nlocal and large-scale metrics with intrinsic galaxy properties. Future work\nwith next-generation surveys and advanced modeling may achieve the precision\nrequired to detect and characterize these subtle environmental correlations."}

We study the X-ray\nproperties of low-mass members of the open cluster NGC 2516 to explicate their\ndetailed dependencies on mass and rotation. We analysed the pointed SRG/eROSITA\nsatellite observations of NGC 2516 obtained during the calibration and\nperformance verification phase of the mission. We found 1561 X-ray sources\nwithin the field of view and related 1007 of them to their optical stellar\ncounterparts, including 655 members of NGC 2516 (433 with rotation periods). We\ncombined these detections with auxiliary optical data to facilitate their\ninterpretation. Furthermore, we extracted X-ray spectra for all sources and fit\ntwo-component APEC models to them. To aid the analysis, we grouped stars with\nsimilar mass and rotational properties together, which allowed us to\ninvestigate the influence of rotation on various X-ray properties. The\ncolour-activity diagram of NGC 2516 displays a general increase in the\nfractional X-ray luminosity with spectral type change from F through G and K to\nM-type. However, the behaviour of K-type stars, representing the ones that best\nsample the fast-to-slow rotational transition, is more complex, with both\nincreased and decreased X-ray emission relative to G-type stars for fast and\nslow rotators, respectively. The rotation-activity diagram is analogous, with\nan identifiable desaturated group of X-ray emitters that corresponds to stars\nin the rotational gap between the fast and slow rotator sequences. We prefer to\ndescribe the normalised X-ray emission for all cluster stars as declining\nlogarithmically with Rossby number over those using broken power laws. Coronal\ntemperatures appear to be largely independent of mass or rotation. (abridged)"}

To address this issue, we perform radiative transfer\npost-processing on the original HESTIA LG constrained simulation. We calibrate\nour source models using a uniform 1024^3 particle, dark-matter only, HESTIA\nsimulation coupled with a subgrid collapse-fraction model to match the global\nreionization observables. These source models are then applied to the HESTIA\nzoom-in simulations, which consist of a 4096^3 particle effective resolution in\nthe zoom region centered on the Milky Way (MW) and M31 haloes, which resolves\nhaloes down to 10^8 solar masses. We find that in all scenarios, reionization\nwithin the LG proceeds in an inside-out manner with the progenitors of the MW\nand M31 having 50 percent of their material ionized by z ~ 9-8.6, significantly\nearlier than the global midpoint at z ~ 7-7.7, noting that external fronts from\nlarge-scale structure play a negligible role, even under the most permissive\nfeedback model. We further show that present-day satellite galaxies exhibit\nonly a weak correlation between their reionization redshift and their\npresent-day radial distance from their host halo, with somewhat tighter trends\naround M31 than the MW. Finally, we find that satellites which assembled before\nreionization are systematically more massive today, suggesting that the oldest\nstellar populations preferentially reside in the most massive subhaloes."}

To determine the dynamical state of each object, we consider\nthe halo mass accretion rate, $\\Gamma$, as well as three observational proxies:\nstellar mass gap, $\\Mstar$; X-ray concentration, $c_\\mathrm{x}$, and X-ray\ncentroid shift, $\\left<w\\right>$. In general, the median values of these\nindicators vary in accordance with an increase in dynamical activity with both\nmass and redshift. We find $\\left<w\\right>$ to be the most reliable proxy,\nwhile $c_\\mathrm{x}$ and $\\Mstar$ are more sensitive to resolution and feedback\nmodel details. Looking at the profiles, the correlation between dark matter\ndensity and $\\Gamma$ has a characteristic radial dependence, being negatively\n(positively) correlated at small (large) radii. This trend is insensitive to\nboth halo mass and redshift. Similar behaviour is also seen for the hot gas\ndensities in low redshift clusters, particularly when using $\\left<w\\right>$,\nbut the correlations become weaker in groups, at higher redshift and when\nstronger feedback is employed. We also find the intrinsic scatter in the gas\ndensity profiles to decrease with redshift, particularly in groups, contrary to\nwhat is seen for the dark matter. Interestingly, the radius of minimum gas\ndensity scatter increases with feedback strength, suggesting that this property\ncould be a useful feedback diagnostic in future observational studies."}

Depending on the surrounding gas density profile, the\n21-cm signature of X-ray heating may still require an exceptionally high star\nformation rate, either intrinsic to the source or provided by other systems\nclustered near it, to avoid dominance of the signal by absorption from the\nsurrounding gas."}
