**TL;DR**: 研究发现了红移1.14处的双环碰撞星系合并系统Cosmic Owl，揭示了星系碰撞和AGN喷流触发的星暴活动在早期宇宙中高效气体转化为恒星的重要机制。

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系合并是驱动星系演化的关键过程，通过改变星系形态、重新分布气体、触发AGN活动和恒星形成等方式影响星系演化。

Data: 使用了JWST、ALMA和VLA的深度成像和光谱数据。

Method: 通过JWST COSMOS-3D项目的棱镜光谱确认了双星系均存在AGN，并结合ALMA和VLA数据分析了星系合并的物理特征。

Result: 发现了一个双环碰撞星系合并系统，其中AGN喷流触发了星暴活动，揭示了星系碰撞和AGN喷流在早期宇宙中高效气体转化为恒星的重要作用。

Abstract: Galaxy mergers play a critical role in driving galaxy evolution, especially
by transforming galaxy morphology, redistributing the gas around galaxies,
triggering AGN activity and star formation. We present the Cosmic Owl, a galaxy
merger at $z=1.14$, identified in the COSMOS field. Deep imaging and
spectroscopy from JWST, ALMA, and VLA reveal a complex system of twin
collisional ring galaxies, exhibiting a nearly identical morphology. The grism
spectra from the JWST COSMOS-3D program confirm that both galaxies host an AGN.
A bipolar radio jet from one AGN extends to strike the merging front. In
addition, we detect a starburst at the merging front, characterized by luminous
extended nebular line emission and a massive cold gas reservoir. This starburst
is likely triggered by interstellar shocks induced by galaxy collision and the
AGN jet. The twin ring structure of the Cosmic Owl requires further numerical
simulations to clarify the precise conditions that lead to the formation of
this rare morphology. This system exemplifies how shock-induced star formation,
driven by galaxy collision or AGN jet, can act as a previously underappreciated
yet crucial mechanism for efficient gas-to-star conversion and rapid stellar
mass assembly in the early Universe.

**TL;DR**: 本研究利用JWST和MUSE数据，测量了17个邻近恒星形成星系中气体云的多环芳烃（PAH）和尘埃连续谱发射寿命，发现其与分子云寿命相似，并探讨了星际介质形态对中红外发射的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: JWST的中红外图像提供了邻近星系中星际介质的详细视图，但目前对气体云中PAH和尘埃连续谱发射的时间尺度及其与分子云形成的关系尚不清楚。

Data: PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1和PHANGS-MUSE数据，包括中红外（7.7-11.3微米）和Hα发射的空间分布。

Method: 通过分析不同尺度下中红外和Hα发射的相对空间分布，测量气体云的PAH和尘埃连续谱发射寿命。

Result: 研究发现气体云的中红外发射时间尺度为10-30Myr，与分子云寿命相似，且星际介质形态（如HII区域和背景结构）会影响中红外发射的持续时间。

Abstract: Recent JWST mid-infrared (mid-IR) images, tracing polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dust continuum emission, provide detailed views of the
interstellar medium (ISM) in nearby galaxies. Leveraging PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1
and PHANGS-MUSE data, we measure the PAH and dust continuum emission lifetimes
of gas clouds across 17 nearby star-forming galaxies by analyzing the relative
spatial distributions of mid-IR (7.7-11.3$\mu$m) and H$\alpha$ emission at
various scales. We find that the mid-IR emitting time-scale of gas clouds in
galaxy disks (excluding centers) ranges from 10 to 30Myr. After star formation
is detected in H$\alpha$, mid-IR emission persists for 3-7Myr during the
stellar feedback phase, covering 70-80% of the H$\alpha$ emission. This
significant overlap is due to intense radiation from star-forming regions,
illuminating the surrounding PAHs and dust grains. In most galaxies, the mid-IR
time-scale closely matches the molecular cloud lifetime measured with CO.
Although mid-IR emission is complex as influenced by ISM distribution,
radiation, and abundances of dust and PAHs, the similarity between the two
time-scales suggests that once gas clouds form with compact mid-IR emission,
they quickly provide sufficient shielding for stable CO formation. This is
likely due to our focus on molecular gas-rich regions of galaxies with
near-solar metallicity. Finally, we find that the mid-IR emitting time-scale is
longer in galaxies with well-defined HII regions and less structured
backgrounds, allowing photons to more efficiently heat the ambient ISM
surrounding the HII regions, rather than contributing to diffuse emission. This
suggests that the shape of the ISM also influences mid-IR emission.

### [3] [Bayesian luminosity function estimation in multidepth datasets with selection effects: a case study for $3<z<5$ Ly$α$ emitters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10083)
*Davide Tornotti,Matteo Fossati,Michele Fumagalli,Davide Gerosa,Lorenzo Pizzuti,Fabrizio Arrigoni Battaia*

**TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种分层贝叶斯框架，用于通过联合建模来自多个不同深度、完整性和天空覆盖率的调查数据，推断任何类别天体的光度函数，并以Lyα发射体为例验证了该方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域在推断天体光度函数时面临多源数据深度、完整性和覆盖范围差异的挑战，且现有方法未能充分解决选择效应和测量不确定性。

Data: 使用了1176个红移3 < z < 5的Lyα发射体样本，数据来自多个MUSE调查，涵盖超深窄场（≥90小时，≤1平方角分）到浅宽场（≤5小时，≥20平方角分）。

Method: 提出了一种分层贝叶斯框架，能够联合建模多源数据并显式处理选择效应和测量不确定性（如光度）。

Result: 约束了Lyα发射体的光度函数参数：log(Φ⋆/Mpc−3) = -2.86+0.15−0.17，log(L⋆/erg s−1) = 42.72+0.10−0.09，α = -1.81+0.09−0.09，与基于引力透镜的研究结果一致，但暗端斜率差异表明系统误差开始主导。宽场调查对约束最亮Lyα发射体（log(L/erg s−1) ≥43）至关重要。

Abstract: We present a hierarchical Bayesian framework designed to infer the luminosity
function of any class of objects by jointly modeling data from multiple surveys
with varying depth, completeness, and sky coverage. Our method explicitly
accounts for selection effects and measurement uncertainties (e.g., in
luminosity) and could be generalized to any extensive quantity, such as mass.
We validate the model using mock catalogs, recovering how deep data reaching
$\gtrsim 1.5$ dex below a characteristic luminosity $\tilde{L}^\star$ are
essential to reduce biases at the faint end ($\lesssim 0.1$ dex), while
wide-area data help constrain the bright end. As proof of concept, we consider
a combined sample of 1176 Ly$\alpha$ emitters at redshift $3 < z < 5$ drawn
from several MUSE surveys, ranging from ultra-deep ($\gtrsim 90$ hr) and narrow
($\lesssim 1$ arcmin$^2$) fields to shallow ($\lesssim 5$ hr) and wide
($\gtrsim 20$ arcmin$^2$) fields. With this complete sample, we constrain the
luminosity function parameters $\log(\Phi^\star/\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}) =
-2.86^{+0.15}_{-0.17}$, $\log(L^\star/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) =
42.72^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, and $\alpha = -1.81^{+0.09}_{-0.09}$, where the
uncertainties represent the $90\%$ credible intervals. These values are in
agreement with studies based on gravitational lensing that reach
$\log(L/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) \approx 41$, although differences in the
faint-end slope underscore how systematic errors are starting to dominate. In
contrast, wide-area surveys represent the natural extension needed to constrain
the brightest Ly$\alpha$ emitters [$\log(L/\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}) \gtrsim 43$],
where statistical uncertainties still dominate.

### [4] [A novel method to trace the dark matter density profile around supermassive black holes with AGN reverberation mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10122)
*Mayank Sharma,Gonzalo Herrera,Nahum Arav,Shunsaku Horiuchi*

**TL;DR**: 提出了一种利用活动星系核（AGN）的回响映射测量来推断遥远超大质量黑洞（SMBH）附近暗物质密度分布的新方法，并在部分AGN中发现了暗物质存在的证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 目前对超大质量黑洞附近暗物质密度分布的研究存在方法上的局限性，而回响映射技术为测量不同半径内的质量提供了新途径，有助于理解暗物质的性质和动力学。

Data: 使用了14个活动星系核（AGN）的回响映射测量数据，特别是多发射线的映射数据。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，通过回响映射测量推断超大质量黑洞附近的暗物质密度分布，并分析了不同半径内的质量分布。

Result: 在14个AGN中，有5个的观测质量随半径增加，暗示了暗物质的存在（1-2σ水平），并发现这些源的暗物质分布具有一致的径向陡度指数γ∼1.6；对其他AGN，得出了暗物质密度分布参数的上限。最显著的暗物质证据来自最远的对象3C 390。

Abstract: We propose a new method to determine the dark matter density profile in the
vicinity of distant supermassive black holes (SMBH) using reverberation mapping
measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN). For some AGN, the mapping of
multiple emission lines allows us to measure the enclosed mass within different
radii from the central SMBH, which allows us to infer or constrain the dark
matter density profile on sub-pc scales. We find that for five out of fourteen
AGN in our identified sample, the observed enclosed mass grows with radii,
hinting evidence for the presence of a dark matter component at the 1-2
$\sigma$ level. For these sources, we find global evidence for a universal dark
matter profile with a preferred radial steepness of index $\gamma \sim 1.6$,
consistent with the scenario expected for a dark matter spike mildly relaxed by
stellar heating processes. For the remaining AGN in our sample, we are able to
derive upper limits on the dark matter density profile parameters.
Interestingly, the strongest evidence for a dark matter component arises from
the farthest object considered, 3C 390. This new method allows us to measure or
constrain for the first time the dark matter density in the vicinity of
extragalactic SMBHs, which is crucial to our understanding of the dynamics and
nature of dark matter.

### [5] [Kinematic Confirmation of a Remarkable Linear Trail of Galaxies in the NGC 1052 Field, Consistent with Formation in a High-Speed Bullet Dwarf Collision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10220)
*Michael A. Keim,Pieter van Dokkum,Zili Shen,Harrison Souchereau,Imad Pasha,Shany Danieli,Roberto Abraham,Aaron J. Romanowsky,Yimeng Tang*

**TL;DR**: 研究发现NGC 1052场中一条独特的线性星系轨迹，包括缺乏暗物质的超弥散星系DF2和DF4，支持这些星系通过高速碰撞形成的理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 最近在NGC 1052场中发现了一条独特的线性弥散星系轨迹，其中包括缺乏暗物质且拥有异常明亮球状星团的超弥散星系DF2和DF4。已有理论提出该轨迹是由两个富含气体的矮星系高速碰撞形成的。

Data: 研究使用了七个附加星系轨迹的径向速度数据，以及DF2和DF4的已知速度和位置数据。

Method: 采用了多种观测方法，包括在球状星团上放置窄缝、Keck/LRIS上的新型宽缝模式以及Keck/KCWI上的'光桶'模式，以测量表面亮度高达28.6 mag arcsec^-2的星系。

Result: 研究发现五个目标星系遵循DF2和DF4预测的精确速度趋势，概率仅为2%，且这些星系的径向速度显著高于NGC 1052星系群，支持它们作为一个独立的、动力学上相连的系统形成于单一事件的理论。

Abstract: A unique linear trail of diffuse galaxies was recently identified in the NGC
1052 field. This trail includes the remarkable, ultra-diffuse galaxies DF2 and
DF4 which lack dark matter and host unusually luminous globular clusters. It
has been proposed that the trail formed via a high-speed collision between two
gas-rich dwarf galaxies. This scenario predicts that the trail galaxies are
kinematically connected and follow a specific trend in radial velocity as a
function of position, based on the known velocities and positions of DF2 and
DF4. To test this hypothesis, we measured radial velocities for seven
additional galaxies on the trail. While the galaxies' low surface brightnesses
presented observational challenges, we employ several methods to obtain
measurements for galaxies with effective surface brightnesses up to 28.6 mag
arcsec$^{-2}$, including a narrow slit placed over globular clusters and a
novel wide slit mode on Keck/LRIS, as well as a 'light bucket' mode on
Keck/KCWI. We find that five of our seven targets follow the precise velocity
trend predicted by DF2 and DF4, to a degree with just a 2% chance of randomly
occurring. Moreover, the trail galaxies' radial velocities are significantly
higher than those of the NGC 1052 group, setting it apart as a separate,
kinematically connected system. Our findings support the theory that this trail
of galaxies, including DF2 and DF4, formed together in a single event. A
'bullet dwarf' collision remains the only known explanation for all the unusual
properties of DF2, DF4, and the associated trail of galaxies.

### [6] [Precipitation plausible: magnetized thermal instability in the intracluster medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10277)
*Benjamin D. Wibking,G. Mark Voit,Brian W. O'Shea*

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过数值模拟表明，磁化热不稳定性可能是导致星系团核心区域冷却时间与自由落体时间比值在10到30之间的关键因素，并解释了冷气体积累与AGN反馈的关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 观测显示，星系团核心区域的AGN反馈与短冷却时间和冷气体积累密切相关，且冷却时间与自由落体时间的比值通常不低于10，而冷气体积累在比值超过30的环境中很少见。

Data: 研究使用了数值模拟数据，模拟了具有初始均匀磁场的磁化分层大气。

Method: 通过数值模拟研究了磁化分层大气中的热不稳定性，分析了不同冷却时间与自由落体时间比值（10和20）以及不同热压力与磁压力比值（β ≤ 100和β ≤ 10）下的冷气体积累情况。

Result: 研究发现，磁化大气比非磁化大气更容易导致冷气体积累，尤其是在冷却时间与自由落体时间比值在10到30之间时。AGN反馈通过冷气体积累触发，防止比值降至10以下，从而解释了观测到的现象。

Abstract: Observations of galaxy-cluster cores reveal that AGN feedback is strongly
associated with both a short central cooling time ($t_{\rm c} \lesssim 10^9 \,
{\rm yr}$) and accumulations of cold gas ($\lesssim 10^4 \, {\rm K}$). Also,
the central ratio of cooling time to freefall time is rarely observed to drop
below $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \approx 10$, and large accumulations of cold gas
are rarely observed in environments with $t_{\rm c} / t_{\rm ff} \gtrsim 30$.
Here we show that the critical range -- $10 \lesssim t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff}
\lesssim 30$ -- plausibly results from magnetized thermal instability. We
present numerical simulations of magnetized stratified atmospheres with an
initially uniform magnetic field. Thermal instability in an otherwise static
atmosphere with $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \approx 10$ progresses to nonlinear
amplitudes, causing cooler gas to accumulate, as long as the background ratio
of thermal pressure to magnetic pressure is $\beta \lesssim 100$. And in
atmospheres with $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff} \approx 20$, cooler gas accumulates for
$\beta \lesssim 10$. Magnetized atmospheres are therefore much more likely to
precipitate than unmagnetized atmospheres with otherwise identical properties.
We hypothesize that AGN feedback triggered by accumulations of cold gas
prevents $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff}$ from dropping much below 10, because cold gas
inevitably precipitates out of magnetized galactic atmospheres with lower
ratios, causing $t_{\rm c}/t_{\rm ff}$ to rise.

*Gizay Yolalan,Timur Şahin,Selçuk Bilir,Olcay Plevne*

**TL;DR**: 对太阳附近的五颗贫金属恒星进行了详细的化学、运动学和轨道动力学分析，揭示了它们的起源和动力学特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前对贫金属恒星的研究有助于理解银河系的形成和演化，但部分恒星的化学和动力学特性尚未完全揭示。

Data: 使用了来自ELODIE和ESPaDOnS仪器的高分辨率光谱数据。

Method: 通过基于ATLAS9模型大气的LTE分析方法，推导了29种元素（25种元素）的丰度。

Result: 研究发现五颗恒星具有不同的起源：HD 2665与球状星团NGC 5139相似，HD 218857与NGC 5634一致，HD 122956与NGC 6864（M75）相关，而HD 5916和HD 189349则属于厚盘星族。

Abstract: This study presents a detailed chemical, kinematic, and orbital dynamic
analysis of five metal poor stars in the solar neighborhood: HD 2665, HD 5916,
HD 122956, HD 189349, and HD 218857. Using high-resolution spectroscopic data
from the ELODIE and ESPaDOnS instruments, we derived elemental abundances for
29 species (25 elements: C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe,
Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, Ce, Nd, and Sm) via LTE based analysis with
ATLAS9 model atmospheres. Notably, we report first time detections of Ce and Nd
in HD2665; Al, V, Sm, and Mn in HD5916; Al in HD 122956; and C, O, S, Sc, Mn,
Co, Cu, Zn, Sr, Zr, Nd, and Sm in HD 189349. Dynamical and chemical diagnostics
reveal distinct origins: HD 2665 shows strong orbital and chemical similarity
to GC NGC 5139 ($\omega$ Cen), while HD 218857 exhibits chemodynamic signatures
consistent with NGC 5634. HD 122956 aligns with NGC 6864 (M75), though
intriguingly shares age, metallicity ([Fe/H]), and [Mg/Fe] ratios with NGC
6517, a cluster whose reported abundances are derived solely from one star with
APOGEE $H$-band spectroscopic measurements, as no optical spectroscopic data
exist for its members. In contrast, HD 5916 and HD 189349 exhibit kinematic and
chemical properties consistent with the field-star population and are
classified as thick disk members.

### [8] [Open clusters in the outer disc studied with MEGARA@GTC Auner 1 and Berkeley 102](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10512)
*J. Carbajo-Hijarrubia,R. Carrera,F. Anders,C. Jordi,L. Casamiquela,L. Balaguer-Núñez,A. Gil de Paz*

**TL;DR**: 本研究利用GTC/MEGARA光谱仪对两个未充分研究的银河系外盘开放星团Auner 1和Berkeley 102进行了分析，揭示了它们的年龄、距离、金属丰度及化学元素丰度比，为银河系外盘的化学演化模型提供了新数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 开放星团对研究恒星核合成和银河系盘的化学演化至关重要，因为它们的年龄和距离比场星更容易精确测定。然而，银河系外盘区域的开放星团研究较少，Auner 1和Berkeley 102位于银河系中心距离约14 kpc的未充分探索区域。

Data: 使用GTC望远镜的MEGARA积分场单元（IFU）光谱仪获取了Auner 1和Berkeley 102中红巨星成员的中等分辨率光谱（R > 18,700）。

Method: 通过分析光谱数据，测量了径向速度、恒星大气参数以及六种元素（Fe、Ca、Co、Ni、Ba、Eu）的化学丰度，并更新了星团的年龄和距离估计。

Result: 研究发现Auner 1和Berkeley 102均为古老（3.2 +- 0.7 Ga）、遥远（d ~ 8 kpc）且位于银河平面下方（Z Gal ~ -0.7 kpc）的星团，金属丰度分别为[Fe/H] = -0.30 +- 0.09和[Fe/H] = -0.35 +- 0.06。元素丰度比与预期趋势一致，但[Ca/Fe]略高，Berkeley 102的[Eu/Fe]显著增强（[Eu/Fe] = 0.64 +- 0.05）。

Abstract: Open clusters offer crucial insights into stellar nucleosynthesis and the
chemical evolution of the Galactic disc, as their ages and distances can be
determined with higher accuracy compared to field stars. In this study, we
investigate the outermost regions of the Milky Way disc using two previously
unstudied open clusters -Auner 1 and Berkeley 102- located at Galactocentric
distances of approximately 14 kpc in largely uncharted areas of the Galaxy. We
obtained medium-resolution spectra (R > 18,700) using the MEGARA integral-field
unit (IFU) spectrograph on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), targeting
red giant member stars in both clusters. From these spectra, we derived radial
velocities, stellar atmospheric parameters, and chemical abundances for six
elements: Fe, Ca, Co, Ni, Ba, and Eu. Additionally, we provide updated
estimates of the clusters' ages and distances. Both clusters are old (3.2 +-
0.7 Ga), distant (d ~ 8 kpc), and lie below the Galactic plane (Z Gal ~ -0.7
kpc), with moderate extinction (AV ~ 1.3 mag). We find that Auner 1 has a
metallicity of [Fe/H] = -0.30 +- 0.09 and Berkeley 102 of [Fe/H] = -0.35 +-
0.06, consistent with other clusters at similar Galactocentric radii and
indicating minimal azimuthal variation in metallicity. The [X/Fe] abundance
ratios align with expected trends, although [Ca/Fe] is slightly higher in both
clusters, and [Eu/Fe] is notably enhanced in Berkeley 102 ([Eu/Fe] = 0.64 +-
0.05). Our findings highlight the effectiveness of GTC/MEGARA in IFU mode for
Galactic archaeology and emphasize the need for further medium-to-high
resolution spectroscopic studies of remote open clusters to refine models of
the outer Galactic disc's chemical evolution.

**TL;DR**: 本文探讨了未来观测技术如何帮助揭示星系中气体流动的路径，并提出了Habitable Worlds Observatory（HWO）所需的高分辨率紫外光谱仪参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系中气体的流入、通过和流出过程对理解星系生态系统至关重要，但目前气体流动的具体路径尚未明确。

Data: 未明确提及具体数据，但建议使用高分辨率紫外光谱仪观测波长范围940-3500 A（最低970-3000 A）的气体。

Method: 建议使用Habitable Worlds Observatory（HWO）的高分辨率紫外光谱仪，光谱分辨率100,000（最低50,000），配备多目标光谱仪和数千个子弧秒狭缝，视场6' x 6'。

Result: 这些观测能力将有助于表征盘-晕界面中的气体，从而推动对气体流动和星系生态系统的理解取得突破。

Abstract: How gas gets into, through, and out of galaxies is critical to understanding
galactic ecosystems. The disk-CGM interface region is uniquely suited for
studying processes that drive gas flows. Matter and energy that enter and leave
a galaxy pass through this region; however, the precise pathways are yet to be
explored. In this paper, we discuss future observations that will facilitate
the discovery of the gas flow pathways in galaxies and the telescope parameters
necessary for making those observations. We advocate for high spectral
resolution ultraviolet spectroscopic capabilities on the Habitable Worlds
Observatory (HWO) that will enable observations in a wavelength range of 940 -
3500 A (minimum range: 970 - 3000 A) and at a resolution of 100,000 (minimum of
50,000). We advocate 19 for a multi-object spectrograph with thousands of
sub-arcsec slitlets and a field of view 6' x 6'. We also recommend that the
spectrograph be sensitive enough to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 or
higher within a few hours for a continuum source of 21 AB magnitude and
estimate an optimal aperture size of 8 meters. These capabilities would enable
the characterization of gas in the disk-halo interface, leading to
breakthroughs in our understanding of the gas flows and galactic ecosystems.

**TL;DR**: 通过多频率VLBA观测，研究了三颗超亮红外星系中的AGN活动，确认其中一颗星系具有AGN驱动的射电辐射，并探讨了高频谱陡化的可能原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 超亮红外星系中可能存在深埋的活动星系核（AGN），但对其射电辐射的AGN驱动证据尚不明确。

Data: 使用了2.3GHz和8.4GHz的多频率VLBA观测数据。

Method: 通过VLBA观测分析射电辐射的紧凑性和亮度温度，并结合光谱陡化现象进行研究。

Result: 确认IRAS F00188-0856具有AGN驱动的射电辐射，其他星系证据不足；高频谱陡化可能源于合并动力学或AGN活动加速的粒子。

Abstract: We report multifrequency Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 2.3
and 8.4GHz of three nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies, identified via
mid-infrared spectroscopic analyses as hosting deeply embedded active galactic
nuclei (AGNs). Milliarcsecond-scale observations at both frequencies reveal
compact continuum emission in IRAS F00188$-$0856 and IRAS F01298$-$0744,
accounting for $\sim10$% of the flux density measured on arcsecond scales. The
non-detection in IRAS F00091$-$0738 and the lower limit on the intrinsic 8.4
GHz brightness temperature of $10^{6.1}$ K in IRAS F01298$-$0744 yield no
conclusive evidence of AGN-driven radio emission, whereas the measurement of
$10^{7.8}$ K in IRAS F00188$-$0856 confirms an AGN origin. Thus, the
mid-infrared AGN classification remains robust, with at least one object
exhibiting compact radio emission indicative of AGN activity. We further
investigate the high-frequency spectral steepening observed in all three
galaxies. In each case, this steepening arises from spectral aging in diffuse
kpc-scale emission, which is resolved out by the VLBA observations. One
possible explanation for the steepening of the sample is merger-induced
particle acceleration. IRAS F00188$-$0856 exhibits a peaked radio spectrum,
characteristic of a young radio source, with the high-frequency steepening
attributable to this AGN activity. Consequently, the spectral steepening at
high frequencies arises from particles accelerated by merger dynamics or AGN
activity.

Abstract: One important key in understanding a galaxy's evolution is to study the
consequences of its past dynamical interactions that influenced its shape. By
measuring the metallicity distribution of stellar populations with different
ages, one can learn about these interactions. The Magellanic Clouds, being the
nearest pair of interacting dwarf galaxies with a morphology characterised by
different tidal and kinematic sub-structures as well as a vast range of stellar
populations, represent an excellent place to study the consequences of
dwarf-dwarf galaxy interactions and with their large host, the Milky Way. We
aim to determine the metallicities ([Fe/H]) of red giant branch (old) and
supergiant (young) stars covering the entire galaxies, estimate their radial
metallicity gradients and produce homogeneous metallicity maps. We use the XP
spectra from Gaia Data Release 3 to calculate synthetic Str\"omgren magnitudes
from the application of the GaiaXPy tool and adopt calibration relations from
the literature to estimate the metallicities. We present photometric
metallicity maps for ~90,000 young stars and ~270,000 old stars within ~11 deg
of the Small Magellanic Cloud and ~20 deg of the Large Magellanic Cloud from a
homogeneous dataset. We find that the overall radial metallicity gradients
decrease linearly in agreement with previous studies. We apply
piecewise-regression fitting to derive the gradients within different radial
regions. The overall metallicity gradients, traced by young and old stars,
decrease from the centre to the outskirts of both galaxies. However, they show
multiple breakpoints depicting regions following different and sometime
opposite trends. These are associated to the structure of the galaxies, their
history of star formation and chemical evolution but may be influenced by a low
number of sources, especially at the centre (due to crowding) and in the
outermost regions.

**TL;DR**: 研究分析了四个红移约3.5的射电活动星系核（AGN）及其伴星云系统的[CII]和连续谱观测，发现AGN宿主星系气体贫乏，而附近存在气体丰富的伴星云，可能触发射电AGN活动或受其反馈影响。

Background: 冷气体系统在星系演化中扮演重要角色，可能为活动星系核（AGN）活动和恒星形成提供燃料。当前研究关注红移约3.5的射电AGN及其伴星云系统，以探索冷气体分布及其与AGN的相互作用。

Data: 使用了ALMA观测的[CII]158微米和连续谱数据，以及重新分析的[CI]数据（H2示踪剂）。

Method: 通过分析[CII]和[CI]的空间分布及光度，评估AGN宿主星系及其伴星云的气体含量和相互作用。

Result: 研究发现AGN宿主星系气体贫乏，而附近存在气体丰富的伴星云，这些伴星云可能是AGN活动的触发因素或受其反馈影响，表明高红移AGN与周围冷气体云存在显著相互作用。

Abstract: Cold gaseous systems play important roles in galaxy evolution by possibly
providing fuel to ignite active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity and
star-formation. In this work, we analyze [CII]$158\rm \mu m$ and continuum
observations from ALMA for a sample of four radio AGN at $z \approx 3.5$,
focusing on eight associated companion cloud systems discovered within
projected distances of tens of kiloparsecs or less. The spatial distribution of
these companions indicates that the majority of cold gas is not located at the
AGN position, i.e., not in their host galaxies. With the assistance of [CII] at
0.2" resolution, we further confirm the gas-poor nature of the hosts by
re-analyzing archival [CI] (a tracer of H$_{2}$) at $\sim2"$ resolution. Our
sample has [CII] luminosities in a range of $2.8\times10^{8}<L_{\rm
[CII]}/L_{\odot}<4.2\times10^{9}$. The $L_{\rm [CII]}/L_{\rm IR}$ ratio, $\sim
9.4\times10^{-4}$, is consistent with sources discussed in the literature. Our
findings show the gas-poor radio AGN hosts have nearby gas-rich companions. We
propose that these companions, which may be stripped clouds in merger process
and by interaction with the energy output from the AGN, could also be a trigger
of radio-loud AGN. They may also be a signature of negative AGN feedback (e.g.,
shock heating) on these infalling companions and on the host galaxy. In
general, our analysis shows that powerful AGN at and before Cosmic Noon are
impacting and being impacted by cold gaseous clouds in their circum-galactic or
proto-intracluster media.

Background: 暗物质与重子能量密度的相似性表明存在一个类似于可见QCD的暗区，而小尺度结构问题可以通过暗物质自相互作用解决，两者均指向GeV尺度的暗QCD区。

Data: 未明确提及具体数据，但讨论了与最新Neff测量相关的潜在第三巧合。

Method: 研究采用了一种手性暗QCD模型，并引入了MeV尺度的暗光子。

Result: 当前约束在参数空间中留下了一个有限的窗口，未来实验（如Gamma Factory）可以测试这一模型。

Abstract: The similarity between dark matter and baryon energy densities suggests the
existence of a dark sector analogous to the visible QCD sector. In addition,
small-scale structure issues can be addressed by dark matter self-interactions
with a cross section comparable to that of QCD. Both observations point to a
GeV-scale dark QCD sector. In this letter, guided by these two coincidences, we
investigate how a chiral dark QCD model with a MeV-scale dark photon can
resolve the core-cusp problem. A potential third coincidence, associated with
the latest measurement of $N_{\rm eff}$ being lower than the Standard Model
prediction, is also discussed. Current constraints leave a finite window in the
parameter space, which can be tested by future experiments such as Gamma
Factory.

**TL;DR**: 研究通过先进太阳系模型发现，恒星飞掠对过去5600万年的古气候重建没有影响，强调了完整物理模型的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 恒星飞掠（stellar flybys）对太阳系长期动力学演化、奥尔特云彗星注入太阳系及跨海王星天体特性等有显著影响，但此前简化模型认为其对5000万年前的古气候有重要影响。

Data: 使用了包含月球贡献和太阳四极矩J2的先进太阳系模型，并进行了超过400次随机恒星参数的模拟。

Method: 采用先进太阳系模型，包括月球贡献和太阳四极矩J2，进行随机恒星参数的模拟。

Result: 研究发现恒星飞掠对过去5600万年的古气候重建没有影响，即使在极端飞掠情景下也未检测到地球轨道演化的明显变化。

Abstract: Passing stars (also called stellar flybys) have notable effects on the solar
system's long-term dynamical evolution, injection of Oort cloud comets into the
solar system, properties of trans-Neptunian objects, and more. Based on a
simplified solar system model, omitting the Moon and the Sun's quadrupole
moment J2, it has recently been suggested that passing stars are also an
important driver of paleoclimate before ~50 Myr ago, including a climate event
called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (~56 Myr ago). In contrast, using a
state-of-the-art solar system model, including a lunar contribution and J2, and
random stellar parameters (>400 simulations), we find no influence of passing
stars on paleoclimate reconstructions over the past 56 Myr. Even in an extreme
flyby scenario in which the Sun-like star HD 7977 (m = 1.07 M_Sun) would have
passed within ~3,900 au about 2.8 Myr ago (with 5% likelihood), we detect no
discernible change in Earth's orbital evolution over the past 70 Myr, compared
to our standard model. Our results indicate that a complete physics model is
essential to accurately study the effects of stellar flybys on Earth's orbital
evolution.

**TL;DR**: The AGE-PRO survey uses ALMA to study the evolution of gas disk mass and size in protoplanetary disks across three star-forming regions, revealing a decline in median gas mass with age and differing gas-to-dust mass ratios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The study aims to systematically trace the evolution of gas disk mass and size in protoplanetary disks, addressing gaps in understanding their lifecycle and initial conditions.

Data: The study uses data from 30 disks around M3-K6 stars in three star-forming regions: Ophiuchus (0.5-1 Myr), Lupus (1-3 Myr), and Upper Sco (2-6 Myr).

Method: The survey employs ALMA observations and population synthesis models, comparing magneto-hydrodynamic wind-driven accretion and turbulent-driven models.

Result: Results show a decrease in median gas disk mass with age, differing gas-to-dust mass ratios, and smaller gas disk sizes (74-110 au), supporting magneto-hydrodynamic wind-driven accretion as a plausible mechanism.

Abstract: We present the ALMA Survey of Gas Evolution of PROtoplanetary Disks
(AGE-PRO), a Large Program of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
(ALMA). AGE-PRO aims to systematically trace the evolution of gas disk mass and
size throughout the lifetime of protoplanetary disks. It uses a carefully
selected sample of 30 disks around M3-K6 stars in three nearby star-forming
regions: Ophiuchus (0.5-1 Myr), Lupus (1-3 Myr), and Upper Sco (2-6 Myr).
Assuming the three regions had similar initial conditions and evolutionary
paths, we find the median gas disk mass appears to decrease with age. Ophiuchus
disks have the highest median gas mass (6 M$_{\rm Jup}$), while the Lupus and
Upper Sco disks have significantly lower median masses (0.68 and 0.44 M$_{\rm
Jup}$, respectively). Notably, the gas and dust disk masses appear to evolve on
different timescales. This is evidenced by the median gas-to-dust mass ratio,
which decreases from 122 in the youngest disks ($<$1 Myr) to 46 in Lupus disks,
and then increases to 120 in the Upper Sco disks. The median gas disk sizes
range between 74-110 au, suggesting that typical gas disks are much smaller
than those of well-studied, massive disks. Population synthesis models suggest
that magneto-hydrodynamic wind-driven accretion can reproduce median disk
properties across all three regions, when assuming compact disks with a
declining magnetic field over time. In contrast, turbulent-driven models
overestimate gas masses of $>$1 Myr disks by an order of magnitude. Here we
discuss the program's motivation, survey design, sample selection, observation
and data calibration processes, and highlight the initial results.

Abstract: We present Band 6 and Band 7 observations of 10 Lupus disks around M3-K6
stars from the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks (AGE-PRO)
Large Program. In addition to continuum emission in both bands, our Band 6
setup covers the $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$, $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$ and
$\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 lines, while our Band 7 setup covers the
$\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2 line. All of our sources are detected in
$\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}$ and $\mathrm{{}^{13}CO}$, 7 out of 10 are detected in
$\mathrm{C^{18}O}$, and 3 are detected in $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$. We find strong
correlations between the CO isotopologue line fluxes and the continuum flux
densities. With the exception of one disk, we also identify a strong
correlation between the $\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}\,J$=3-2
fluxes, indicating similar CO abundances across this sample. For the two
sources with well-resolved continuum and $\mathrm{{}^{12}CO}\,J$=2-1 images, we
find that their gas-to-dust size ratio is consistent with the median value of
$\sim 2$ inferred from a larger sample of Lupus disks. We derive dust disk
masses from continuum flux densities. We estimate gas disk masses by comparing
$\mathrm{C^{18}O}\,J$=2-1 line fluxes with those predicted by the limited grid
of self-consistent disk models of Ruaud et al. (2022). A comparison of these
mass estimates with those derived by Trapman et al. (2025), using a combination
of CO isotopologue and $\mathrm{N_2H^+}$ line emission, shows that the masses
are consistent with each other. Some discrepancies appear for small and faint
disks, but they are still within the uncertainties. Both methods find gas disk
masses increase with dust disk masses, and gas-to-dust mass ratios are between
$10-100$ in the AGE-PRO Lupus sample.

Abstract: The evolution of the gas mass of planet-forming disks around young stars is
crucial for our understanding of planet formation, yet it has proven hard to
constrain observationally, due both to the difficulties of measuring gas masses
and the lack of a homogeneous sample. Here we present a large grid of
thermochemical models which we use to measure protoplanetary gas disk masses of
AGE-PRO, the ALMA survey of Gas Evolution in PROtoplanetary disks. AGE-PRO
covers a sample of 30 disks around similar spectral type (M3-K6) stars with
ages between 0.1 and 10 Myr. Our approach is to simultaneously fit observations
of CO isotopologues and N2H+, a complementary molecule produced when CO freezes
out. We find that the median gas mass of the three regions decreases over time,
from 7.0(+4.4,-2.6)x10^-3 Msun in Ophiuchus (<1 Myr) to 9.4(+5.4,-3.4)x10^-4
Msun for Lupus (~1-3 Myr) and 6.8(+5.1,-2.8)x10^-4 Msun for Upper Sco (~2-6
Myr), with ~1 dex scatter in gas mass in each region. We note that the gas mass
distributions for Lupus and Upper Sco look very similar, which could be due to
survivorship bias for the latter. The median bulk CO abundance in the CO
emitting layer is found to be a factor ~10 lower than the ISM value but does
not significantly change between Lupus and Upper Sco. From Lupus to Upper Sco
the median gas-to-dust mass ratio increases by a factor ~3 from ~40 to ~120,
suggesting efficient inward pebble drift and/or the formation of planetesimals.

Result: 观测到的气体质量与仅考虑恒定α粘性演化的模拟结果不符，表明其他物理机制在气体质量演化中起作用；大多数AGE-PRO样本的尘埃连续谱发射通量和大小与存在弱或强尘埃陷阱的模拟结果一致；光谱指数的演化也暗示了未解析的尘埃陷阱群的存在。

Abstract: The potential for planet formation of a circumstellar disk depends on the
dust and gas reservoirs, which evolve as a function of the disk age. The ALMA
Large Program AGE-PRO has measured several disk properties across three
star-forming regions of different ages, and in this study we compare the
observational results to dust evolution simulations. Using DustPy for the dust
evolution, and RADMC-3D for the radiative transfer, we ran a large grid of
models spanning stellar masses of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 $M_\odot$, with
different initial conditions, including: disk sizes, disk gas masses, and
dust-to-gas ratio, and viscosity. Our models are performed assuming smooth,
weakly, or strongly substructured disks, aiming to investigate if any
observational trend can favor or exclude the presence of dust traps. The
observed gas masses in the disks of the AGE-PRO sample are not reproducible
with our models, which only consider viscous evolution with constant $\alpha$,
suggesting that additional physical mechanisms play a role in the evolution of
the gas mass of disks. When comparing the dust continuum emission fluxes and
sizes at 1.3 mm, we find that most of the disks in the AGE-PRO sample are
consistent with simulations that have either weak or strong dust traps. The
evolution of spectral index in the AGE-PRO sample is also suggestive of an
unresolved population of dust traps. Future observations at high angular
resolution are still needed to test several hypotheses that result from
comparing the observations to our simulations, including that more massive
disks in gas mass have the potential to form dust traps at larger disk radii.

Background: 原行星盘在毫米波段的连续谱变异性极为罕见，通常被解释为与宿主恒星本身而非其盘相关的非热辐射机制。

Data: 使用了AGE-PRO ALMA大型项目的观测数据，包括连续谱观测和CO(2-1)气体盘发射的动力学分析。

Result: 连续谱流量在不到一小时内衰减了8倍，8天内衰减了13倍；耀发可能是恒星附近同步辐射或磁场相互作用的结果，类似于非常接近的双星系统中检测到的现象。

Abstract: Variability of millimetre wavelength continuum emission from Class II
protoplanetary disks is extremely rare, and when detected it is usually
interpreted as originating from non-thermal emission mechanisms that relate to
the host star itself rather than its disk. During observations made as part of
the AGE-PRO ALMA Large program, significant variability in the brightness of
the 2MASS J16202863-2442087 system was detected between individual executions.
We report the observed properties of the variability detected at millimetre
wavelengths and investigate potential driving mechanisms. To investigate the
nature of the variability we construct a light curve from the continuum
observations and analyse imaged constructed from both flaring and quiescent
emission. We characterise the dust disk around the star through analysis in the
image and visibility plane, and carry out kinematic analysis of the CO(2-1)
emission from the gas disk. The continuum flux decays by a factor of 8 in less
than an hour, and by a factor of 13 within 8 days. The peak brightness
coincides with an expected brightness maximum extrapolated from the periodicity
of previously observed optical variability. The flare is most likely the
product of synchrotron emission in the close vicinity of the star. The nature
of the millimetre flare closely resembles those detected in very close binary
systems, and may be due to the interaction of magnetic fields in an as yet
undetected binary. Alternatively if the central host is a single-star object,
the flare may be due to the interaction of magnetic field loops at the stellar
surface or a strong accretion burst.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 多项观测研究表明，局部几百Mpc范围内存在显著的低密度区域（KBC空洞），这可能通过产生外流效应影响局部膨胀率，从而对哈勃张力产生影响。

Data: 研究使用了CosmicFlows-4汇编中的Tully-Fisher目录的直接距离数据。

Method: 研究采用场级前向模型拟合KBC空洞模型，评估其对哈勃张力的影响。

Result: 研究发现空洞尺寸小于70 Mpc，局部哈勃常数的估计值分别为72.1、70.4和70.2 km/s/Mpc，其中高斯和麦克斯韦-玻尔兹曼分布模型将哈勃张力缓解到3σ以内。

Abstract: Several observational studies suggest that the local few hundred Mpc around
the Local Group are significantly underdense based on source number counts in
redshift space across much of the electromagnetic spectrum, particularly in
near-infrared galaxy counts. This ``Keenan--Barger--Cowie (KBC) void'', ``Local
Hole'', or ``local supervoid'', would have significant ramifications for the
Hubble tension by generating outflows that masquerade as an enhanced local
expansion rate. We evaluate models for the KBC void capable of resolving the
Hubble tension with a background Planck cosmology. We fit these models to
direct distances from the Tully--Fisher catalogue of the CosmicFlows-4
compilation using a field-level forward model. Depending on the adopted void
density profile, we find the derived velocity fields to prefer a void size of
less than 70 Mpc, which is less than 10 per cent of the fiducial size found by
Haslbauer et al. based on the KBC luminosity density data. The predicted local
Hubble constant is $72.1^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$, $70.4^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$, or
$70.2^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ km/s/Mpc for an initial underdensity profile that is
exponential, Gaussian, or Maxwell-Boltzmann, respectively. The latter two
ameliorate the Hubble tension to within $3\sigma$ of the 4-anchor distance
ladder approach of Breuval et al. giving $73.2 \pm 0.9$ km/s/Mpc. The
exponential profile does achieve consistency with this measurement at just over
$1\sigma$, but it is disfavoured by the Bayesian evidence. The preferred models
produce bulk flow curves that disagree with recent estimates from
CosmicFlows-4, despite the void models being flexible enough to match such
estimates.

up to 0.7. These stars gained their high Sr abundance from a poorly understood
process, which may appear to be a weak s-process or a weak r-process. Our aim
is to uncover the nature of this additional Sr source. The abundances derived
from the resonance Ba II lines are influenced by the adopted Ba isotope
mixture. We compute Ba isotope mixtures corresponding to different r- to
s-process contributions and determine the corresponding abundances from the Ba
II resonance lines in each sample star. Additionally, we determine Ba
abundances from weak subordinate Ba II lines, which are unaffected by the
adopted Ba isotope mixture. We then compare the Ba abundances derived from the
subordinate lines with those from the Ba II resonance lines. We find a higher
s-process contribution to Ba isotopes in stars with greater [Sr/Eu] and [Sr/Ba]
overabundances, suggesting that the additional Sr synthesis was due to the
early s-process occurring in massive stars. We estimate the [Sr/Ba] ratio
produced by the early s-process and obtain [Sr/Ba]_earlyS = 1.1 +- 0.2.
Regarding the potential synthesis of Sr and Ba in the i-process in massive
stars, our results argue that there was no detectable contribution from this
process within the error bars in our sample stars. In the early Galaxy, before
significant main s-process enrichment, barium and strontium were produced
primarily by the main r-process and the early s-process, which occurred in
rapidly rotating massive stars.

Background: 太阳附近的演化恒星研究对于理解恒星演化和银河系结构具有重要意义，但现有文献对AGB恒星的极端尘埃产生恒星样本不足，且恒星演化模型对约500 Myr年龄的AGB恒星数量预测偏高。

Result: 研究发现Gaia APSIS GSP-Phot AENEAS对亮巨星温度的测定常偏低，AGB恒星的空间分布与银河系盘300 pc的尺度高度一致，且大部分尘埃产生的碳星属于银河系厚盘星族。

Abstract: We provide a meta-study of the statistical and individual properties of two
volume-complete sets of evolved stars in the Solar Neighbourhood: (1) 852 stars
from the Nearby Evolved Stars Survey (NESS), and (2) a partially overlapping
set of 507 evolved stars within 300 pc. We also investigate distance
determinations to these stars, their luminosity functions and their spatial
distribution. Gaia APSIS GSP-Phot AENEAS temperatures of bright giant stars
often appear to be underestimated. Existing literature on AGB stars
under-samples both the most and least extreme nearby dust-producing stars. We
reproduce the literature star-formation history of the solar neighbourhood,
though stellar-evolution models over-predict the number of AGB stars of ages
around 500 Myr. The distribution of AGB stars broadly matches the known 300 pc
scale height of the Galactic disc and shows concentration in the direction of
the Galactic centre. Most dust-producing carbon stars belong to the Galactic
thick-disc population.

Abstract: Black hole shadows are a widespread topic in astrophysics. This paper
searches for an optical view of the black hole and the relationship between
black hole shadow and photon sphere with curvature. We were inspired by the
observations of Sagittarius $A^*$ and supermassive black hole M87$*$ through
the Event Horizon Telescope. We have found the signature of the modified theory
of gravity on the photon sphere and shadow. We considered $f(R)$ modified
theory of gravity and new scalar degree of freedom $F$ appears in the

**TL;DR**: This study evaluates the detection and localization capabilities of future sub-millihertz gravitational wave observatories for massive binary black hole mergers, highlighting improved sensitivity and potential for multi-messenger astronomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Future space-based gravitational wave missions aim to explore the sub-millihertz to microhertz frequency band, focusing on detecting massive binary black hole mergers across cosmic distances, addressing gaps in current capabilities.

Data: The study includes the full galactic foreground noise and evaluates three representative orbital configurations of massive binary black holes.

Method: The research analyzes signal-to-noise ratios and localization performance for various massive binary black hole populations, considering non-precessing and precessing orbital configurations with different inclination angles.

Result: Sub-millihertz missions achieve high signal-to-noise ratios and improved localization of high-mass binary black holes, enabling multi-messenger astronomy and tests of general relativity.

Abstract: Beyond LISA, proposed space-based gravitational wave (GW) missions aim to
explore the sub-millihertz to microhertz frequency band, with one key objective
being the detection of massive binary black hole (MBBH) mergers across cosmic
distances. In this work, we investigate the detection and localization
capabilities of future sub-mHz GW observatories for MBBH coalescences.
Including the full galactic foreground noise, we find that signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs) can reach several thousand across a wide range of redshifts. We
evaluate three representative orbital configurations--non-precessing and
precessing with different inclination angles--and analyze their localization
performance for various MBBH populations. In the non-precessing case, a
two-hemisphere degeneracy arises when only the dominant (2,2) mode is
considered, which is effectively resolved by including higher-order modes.
These modes contribute to a more uniform performance across all configurations,
thereby mitigating the prior advantage of precessing mission orbits. Sub-mHz
missions operating in the [10 $\mu$Hz, 10 mHz] band partially overlap with
LISA's range but provide enhanced sensitivity to lower-frequency GWs due to
their longer interferometric baselines. This results in significantly improved
localization of high-mass MBBHs, enhancing the prospects for multi-messenger
astronomy and precision cosmology. Moreover, the high SNRs attainable with
sub-mHz detectors could enable stringent tests of general relativity and
alternative theories of gravity.
