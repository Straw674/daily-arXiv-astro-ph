It is unclear whether obscured AGN are primarily due to\nline-of-sight effects, a transitory, dust-enshrouded phase in galaxy evolution,\nor a combination of both. The role of an inner torus around the central SMBH\nalso remains unclear in pure Evolution models. We use cosmological\nsemi-analytic models and semi-empirical prescriptions to explore obscuration\neffects in AGN at 1<z<3. We consider a realistic object-by-object modelling of\nAGN evolution including different light curves (LCs) composed of phases of\nvarying levels of obscuration, mimicking the possible clearing effects of\nstrong AGN feedback. Evolution models characterized by AGN LCs with relatively\nshort pre-peak obscured phases followed by more extended optical/UV visible\npost-peak phases, struggle to reproduce the high fraction of obscured AGN at\nz~2-3 inferred from X-ray surveys. Evolution models characterised by LCs with\nsharp post-peak declines or persistent or multiple obscuration phases are more\nsuccessful, although they still face challenges in reproducing the steady drop\nin the fractions of obscured AGN with increasing luminosity measured by some\ngroups. Invoking a fine-tuning in the input LCs, with more luminous AGN defined\nby longer optical/UV visible windows, can improve the match to the decreasing\nfractions of obscured AGN with luminosity. Alternatively, a long-lived central\ntorus-like component, with thickness decreasing with increasing AGN power,\nnaturally boosts the luminosity-dependent fractions of obscured AGN, suggesting\nthat small-scale orientation effects may still represent a key component even\nin Evolution models. We also find that in our models major mergers and\nstarbursts, when considered in isolation, fall short in accounting for the\nlarge fractions of highly obscured faint AGN detected at cosmic noon."}

Quantitative spectroscopy of the stars\nrevealed half of these WR stars to be strong sources of He ii ionizing flux,\nbut the average metallicity of the SMC is below where WR bumps are usually\ndetected in integrated galaxy spectra showing nebular He ii emission. Utilizing\nthe Local Volume Mapper (LVM), we investigate regions around the six SMC WN3h\nstars, whose winds are thin enough to avoid He recombination and allow photons\nwith > 54 eV to escape. Focusing on He ii 4686 {\\AA}, we show that the broad\nstellar wind component, the strongest optical diagnostic of the WN3h stars, is\ndiluted within 24 pc in the integrated light from LVM, making the WR stars hard\nto detect in low-metallicity integrated regions. In addition, we compare the He\nii ionizing flux from LVM with the values inferred from the stellar atmosphere\ncode PoWR and find that the nebular emission around them only in some cases\nreflects the high amounts emitted by the stars. We conclude that early-type WN\nstars with comparably weak winds are viable sources to produce the observed He\nii ionizing flux in low-metallicity galaxies. The easy dilution of the stellar\nsignatures can explain the rareness of WR bump detections at 12 + log O/H <\n8.0, while at the same time providing major candidates for the observed excess\nof nebular He ii emission.

We find that 3.3 um PAH emission is\nconcentrated near the northern super star cluster and is co-spatial with CO\ngas. A strong correlation exists between the 3.3/11.3 PAH ratio and radiation\nhardness probed by NeIII/NeII, providing evidence of photodestruction of PAH\nmolecules in intense radiation environments. Our analysis shows that while the\noverall PAH fraction is lower in II Zw 40 than in higher metallicity galaxies,\nthe contribution of the 3.3 um PAH feature to the total PAH emission is higher.\nWe propose that the PAH size distribution is fundamentally shaped by two\ncompeting mechanisms in low-metallicity environments: photo-destruction and\ninhibited growth. Additionally, the high radiation field intensity in II Zw 40\nsuggests that multi-photon heating of PAHs may be an important effect. As one\nof the first spatially resolved studies of aromatic emission in a\nlow-metallicity environment, our spectroscopic results offer practical guidance\nfor future observations of the 3.3 um PAH feature in low-metallicity galaxies\nusing JWST."}

Since the atmospheric density field is intricately woven into the\natmosphere's governing equations, advancing atmospheric density estimation will\nimprove numerical weather prediction. However, current meteorological\ninstrumentation cannot directly measure the atmospheric density field over\nlarge volumes. Existing techniques rely on sparse point measurements, limiting\nour ability to accurately estimate the three-dimensional atmospheric density\nfield. One potential solution is to employ measurements of the atmospheric muon\nflux. Atmospheric muons are particles produced when energetic atomic nuclei\n(cosmic rays) collide with nuclei in the upper atmosphere, producing a shower\nof secondary particles (muons) that propagates to the Earth's surface. The\nsurface atmospheric muon flux is known to be proportional to the local\natmospheric density field, implying that this technique can be used as a\nmeasurement of atmospheric density. This study examines the potential for using\natmospheric muon flux measurements to improve atmospheric state estimation via\na case study of simulated atmospheric muon observations in the path of tropical\ncyclone Freddy.

Given the renewed interest in IDE models, it is crucial to fully\nunderstand their parameter space when constraining them observationally,\nespecially with regard to the often-neglected issues of negative energy\ndensities and future big rip singularities. In this work, we present a\ncomparative study of the general linear interaction $Q=3H(\\delta_{\\rm\ndm}\\rho_{\\rm dm} + \\delta_{\\rm de}\\rho_{\\rm de})$ and four special cases:\n$Q=3H\\delta(\\rho_{\\rm dm}+\\rho_{\\rm de})$, $Q=3H\\delta(\\rho_{\\rm dm}-\\rho_{\\rm\nde})$, $Q=3H\\delta \\rho_{\\rm dm}$, and $Q=3H\\delta \\rho_{\\rm de}$. For these\nfive models, we perform a dynamical system analysis and derive new conditions\nthat ensure positive, real, and well-defined energy densities throughout cosmic\nevolution, as well as criteria to avoid future big rip singularities.

Many studies of IRDCs employ CO to\ninvestigate cloud dynamics. However, CO can be highly depleted from the gas\nphase in IRDCs, impacting its fidelity as tracer. CO depletion is also of great\ninterest in astrochemistry, since CO ice in dust grain mantles provides the raw\nmaterial for forming complex organic molecules. We study CO depletion toward\nfour IRDCs to investigate how it correlates with volume density and dust\ntemperature, calculated from Herschel images. We use 13CO(1-0) and (2-1) maps\nto measure CO depletion factor, $f_D$, across IRDCs G23.46-00.53, G24.49-00.70,\nG24.94-00.15, and G25.16-00.28. We also consider a normalized CO depletion\nfactor, f_D', which takes a value of unity, i.e., no depletion, in the outer,\nlower density, warmer regions. We then investigate the dependence of f_D and\nf_D' on gas density, $n_H$ and dust temperature, $T_{dust}$. We find CO\ndepletion rises as density increases, reaching maximum values of f_D'$\\sim$10\nin regions with $n_H>3\\times10^5\\:{cm}^{-3}$, although with significant scatter\nat a given density. We find a tighter, less scattered relation of f_D' with\ntemperature, rising rapidly for temperatures <18 K.

We conclude that CO is heavily\ndepleted from the gas phase in cold, dense regions of IRDCs. Thus CO depletion\ncan lead to underestimation of total cloud masses based on CO line fluxes by\nfactors up to 5. These results indicate a dominant role for thermal desorption\nin setting near equilibrium abundances of gas phase CO in IRDCs, providing\nimportant constraints for both astrochemical models and the chemodynamical\nhistory of gas during the early stages of star formation."}
