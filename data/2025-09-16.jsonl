By supplementing Gaia\nphotometry with longer-baseline light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility\n(ZTF) and the Catalina Real Time Transient Survey (CRTS), we test whether the\nreported periodic signals persist beyond the Gaia DR3 time window. We find that\nin all 116 cases with available ZTF data, the Gaia-inferred periodic model\nfails to predict subsequent variability, which appears stochastic rather than\nperiodic. The periodic candidates thus overwhelmingly appear to be false\npositives; red noise contamination appears to be the primary source of false\ndetections. We conclude that truly periodic AGN are exceedingly rare, with at\nmost a few in $10^6$ AGN exhibiting stable periodicity on 100 to 1000 day\ntimescales.

Demographic studies also require a detailed\nunderstanding of the relationship between observed and true exoplanet\npopulations; a task for which current TESS planet catalogs are rendered\nunsuitable by the subjectivity of vetting by eye. We present LEO-Vetter, a\npublicly available and fully automated exoplanet vetting system designed after\nthe Kepler Robovetter, which is capable of efficiently producing catalogs of\npromising planet candidates and making statistically robust TESS demographic\nstudies possible. LEO-Vetter implements flux- and pixel-level tests against\nnoise/systematic false positives and astrophysical false positives. The vetter\nachieves high completeness (91%) and high reliability against noise/systematic\nfalse alarms (97%) based on its performance on simulated data. We demonstrate\nthe usefulness of the vetter by searching ~200,000 M dwarf light curves, and\nreducing ~20,000 transit-like detections down to 172 uniformly vetted planet\ncandidates. LEO-Vetter facilitates analyses that would otherwise be impractical\nto perform on all possible signals due to time constraints or computational\nlimitations.

In\nmost studies, these relations have been obtained for large portions of the\ngalaxies (i.e., on kpc scales), but it is also important to evaluate these\nrelations in smaller scales. In this work, we used optical data cubes of a\nsubsample of nearby galaxies of the DIVING 3D survey. These allowed us to\nanalyze the scaling relations involving stellar velocity dispersion, stellar\npopulation age, and stellar population metallicity at the nuclear and\ncircumnuclear regions of galaxies. We detected correlations between the stellar\nvelocity dispersion and the age, metallicity, and total stellar mass. These\ncorrelations are independent of galaxy inclinations, considering all\nmorphological types, nuclear activity, and the presence or absence of galactic\nbars. We detected, for the first time, a correlation between the stellar\nvelocity dispersion and stellar metallicity in the nuclear regions of galaxies.\nIt is found to be qualitatively consistent with the well-known stellar\nmass-metallicity relation. We also noted that barred galaxies tend to show\nyounger and less metal-rich stellar populations than unbarred galaxies in the\ncentral regions, which may be a consequence of the bar triggering star\nformation in the nuclear regions of these objects. Some active galactic nuclei\n(AGNs) in our sample are positioned above the observed correlation between\nstellar velocity dispersion and stellar population age, suggesting that their\nnuclear stellar populations are younger than expected. This may be a\nconsequence of positive AGN feedback, triggering star formation. Conversely,\nstarburst galaxies do not show nuclear stellar populations at ages over one\nbillion years."}

Both star-forming (SF) and quiescent (QS)\nmisaligned galaxies exhibit narrower HI linewidths compared to their gas-star\naligned controls. The HI profiles of SF misaligned galaxies tend to be\nsingle-peaked, displaying a slightly higher fraction of single-peaked shape\ncompared to their aligned controls. The QS misaligned galaxies exhibit\nprominently single-peaked HI profiles, while their aligned controls show\ndistinct double-horned profiles. The shape of HI profiles is expected to change\nwith the HI surface density radial gradients through external gas accretion --\nthe interaction between the accreted gas and the pre-existing gas leads to the\nre-distribution of angular momentum and induces gas inflow. It suggests that\nthe progenitors of SF misaligned galaxies are central HI-enriched, in this\ncase, the shape of HI profiles is insensitive to the further increase of\ncentral HI surface density. The progenitors of QS misaligned galaxies are\ncentral HI-deficient, hence the transition from central HI-deficient to\nHI-enriched surface density leads to significantly more single-peaked HI\nprofiles."}

We demonstrate that high-precision\ncosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments like the Atacama Cosmology\nTelescope (ACT), though designed for cosmology, offer a unique capability for\nsuch time-domain science due to their high cadence and broad sky coverage in\nmillimeter bands. While previous ACT searches have focused on transients\nlasting minutes or longer, we develop and validate analysis methods to search\nfor periodic, millisecond-scale transients, a capability not typically\nassociated with CMB experiments. We describe a phase-resolved mapmaking\napproach, which leverages the known periodicity of the signal to enhance\nsensitivity and offers advantages in diagnosing systematic errors. We also\nintroduce a template-based fit to the raw data timestreams that independently\nvalidate our results. Applying these methods to estimate the millimeter flux of\nthe Crab Pulsar (PSR B0531+21), we derive 95% confidence upper limits of 4.6\nmJy, 4.4 mJy, and 20.7 mJy on the pulsar's period-averaged flux density at 96\nGHz, 148 GHz, and 225 GHz, respectively.

To test the hypothesis that the\nGalactic nucleus may act as a source of matter and energy capable of\naccelerating galaxy formation, we examined whether the Milky Way itself shows\nsigns of central activity. Expansion of the Galactic center would imply such\nactivity in its nuclear region. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed\nstellar motions along the south north axis of the Galaxy using Gaia DR3 data.\nAverage Galactocentric radial velocities were computed in 50 control points,\nspaced by 0.1 kpc with a sampling radius of 0.05 kpc, up to 5 kpc from the\nGalactic center. The results show a strong symmetry: in the northern region, 36\nof 50 points have positive velocities, with an average of 19.15 +/- 10.80 km/s\n(N = 50), while in the southern region, 37 of 50 points have negative\nvelocities, with an average of - 19.24 +/- 8.22 km/s (N = 50). A Students t\ntest confirms that the two distributions differ significantly (0.003).\n  The combination of positive average velocities in the north and negative\naverage velocities in the south indicates a symmetric outflow of stars away\nfrom the Galactic center, consistent with expansion in its central region.\n  These Galactocentric radial velocities are consistent with the formation of\nmassive, evolved galaxies within 300 My, as observed by JWST. If extended to\nother galaxies, the results (together with earlier findings on globular cluster\nmotions) suggest that aspects of standard galaxy formation models may require\nrefinement. This interpretation, however, remains preliminary and requires\nfurther study."}

We present\nthe first detection of cis-NMF in the ISM, with 55 unblended or slightly\nblended transitions, 44 of which were new transitions identified based on\nextrapolated spectroscopic data. Due to the lack of collisional rate\ncoefficients, a quasi-non-LTE analysis, which separated the transitions into\ndifferent K$_a$ ladders, was used to determine the excitation conditions. The\nresulting trans/cis-NMF isomeric ratio of 2.9$\\pm$0.6 deviates significantly\nfrom thermodynamic expectations, suggesting that kinetic non-equilibrium\nprocesses and stereospecific chemical pathways are responsible for the\nformation of cis-NMF in this environment.

This work presents metallicities\nand individual abundances for fourteen M dwarfs and six G dwarfs from two\nwell-known open clusters: Hyades and Coma Berenices. Our analysis is based on\nnear-infrared (1.51--1.69 $\\mu$m), high-resolution ($R \\sim 22,500$) spectra\nobtained from the SDSS IV/APOGEE Survey. Using one-dimensional, plane-parallel\nMARCS model atmospheres, the APOGEE line list, and the Turbospectrum radiative\ntransfer code in local thermodynamic equilibrium, we derived spectroscopic\nstellar parameters for the M dwarfs, along with abundances of 13 elements (C,\nO, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, and Fe) for both M and G dwarfs. We\nfind a high degree of chemical homogeneity within each cluster when comparing\nabundances derived from M and G dwarfs: $\\delta$[M/H] (M dwarfs -- G dwarfs) of\n0.01$\\pm$0.04, and 0.02$\\pm$0.03 for the Hyades and Coma Berenices,\nrespectively. The overall cluster metallicities derived from M dwarfs (Hyades:\n0.16$\\pm$0.03 and Coma Berenices: 0.02$\\pm$0.06) are consistent with previous\nliterature determinations. Finally, we demonstrate the value of M dwarfs as key\ntracers in galactic archaeology, emphasizing their potential for studying\ngalactic metallicity gradients and chemical evolution."}
