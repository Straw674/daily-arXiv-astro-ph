### [1] [Differential measurement of m_e/m_p: 3 mm methanol lines toward Sagittarius B2(N) and (M) molecular clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04258)
*J. S. Vorotyntseva,S. A. Levshakov,C. Henkel*

**TL;DR**: 通过测量银河中心附近Sgr B2分子云中的甲醇发射线，发现电子与质子质量比μ的观测值低于地球值，差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 目前对基本物理常数μ（电子与质子质量比）的研究表明，其在地球上的值是固定的，但在宇宙其他区域可能存在变化。本研究旨在通过测量银河中心附近的分子云来验证这一假设。

Data: 使用了IRAM 30米望远镜（80-112 GHz）和Herschel空间望远镜（542-543 GHz）的甲醇（CH3OH）发射线数据。

Method: 通过分析甲醇发射线的频率差异，计算了Δμ/μ的值，并与地球值进行比较。

Result: 在SgrB2分子云中，Δμ/μ的值为(-3.0 ± 0.6)*10^(-7)（1σ置信水平），与Herschel望远镜在更高频率范围测得的结果(-4.2 ± 0.7)*10^(-7)一致，表明μ存在显著变化。

Abstract: Differential measurement of the fundamental physical constant mu = m_e/m_p
(the electron-to-proton mass ratio) toward two sources located near the
Galactic center - the Sagittarius (Sgr) B2(N) and (M) molecular clouds - show a
lower mu compared to its terrestrial value. Based on methanol (CH3OH) emission
lines from the frequency range 80-112 GHz (IRAM 30-m telescope archival data),
the calculated difference (Delta mu)/mu = (mu_obs - mu_lab)/mu_lab is equal to
(-3.0 +/- 0.6)*10^(-7) (1 sigma C.L.) in the whole cloud SgrB2. The revealed 5
sigma signal in mu-variations agrees within the margin of error with the
recently obtained result based on methanol emission lines from the higher
frequency range 542-543 GHz (Herschel space telescope archival data) for
SgrB2(N): (Delta mu)/mu = (-4.2 +/- 0.7)*10^(-7).

### [2] [Fast Rotators at Cosmic Noon: Stellar Kinematics for 15 Quiescent Galaxies from JWST-SUSPENSE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04310)

**TL;DR**: 研究利用JWST-SUSPENSE项目对15颗大质量静止星系在红移1.2-2.3范围内的空间分辨恒星运动学进行了分析，发现这些星系普遍存在旋转支持，支持了静止星系通过合并逐渐演化成低红移大质量椭圆星系的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域对大质量静止星系在宇宙正午时期的运动学特性了解有限，尤其是旋转支持的存在与否及其演化过程。

Data: 使用了JWST-SUSPENSE项目中的15颗大质量静止星系（质量范围为10的10.5到11.5次方太阳质量）的超深NIRSpec/MSA恒星吸收线光谱数据。

Method: 采用前向建模方法，考虑了光学效应、源形态、定位和数据缩减效应，从光谱中提取运动学测量结果。

Result: 研究发现10颗星系表现出显著旋转（旋转速度范围为117到345千米每秒，速度弥散范围为180到387千米每秒），且均为快速旋转体；动态质量显著超过恒星质量（中位数为2.7倍），支持静止星系通过合并演化成低红移大质量椭圆星系的模型。

Abstract: We present spatially-resolved stellar kinematics of 15 massive
($M_*=10^{10.5-11.5}M_{\odot}$) quiescent galaxies at $z\sim1.2-2.3$ from the
JWST-SUSPENSE program. This is the largest sample of spatially-resolved
kinematic measurements of quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon to date. Our
measurements are derived from ultra-deep NIRSpec/MSA stellar absorption line
spectra, using a forward modelling approach that accounts for optics, source
morphology, positioning, and data reduction effects. 10 out of 15 galaxies are
orientated such that we can measure rotational support. Remarkably, all 10
galaxies show significant rotation ($V_{r_e}=117-345$km/s, $\sigma_0 =
180-387$km/s), and are classified as "fast rotators" from their spin parameter.
The remaining galaxies are too misaligned with respect to the slit to constrain
their rotational velocities. The widespread rotational support in our sample
indicates that the process responsible for quenching star formation in early
massive galaxies did not destroy rotating disc structures. When combined with
other quiescent galaxy samples at $z\sim0.5-2.5$, we find a trend between
rotational support and age, with younger quiescent galaxies being more
rotationally supported. This age trend has also been found at $z\sim0$, and
likely explains why our high-redshift galaxies show more rotational support
compared to massive ETGs at $z\sim0$, which are, on average, older. Our
kinematic modelling also enables us to calculate dynamical masses. These
dynamical masses greatly exceed the stellar masses for our sample (median
$M_{\text{dyn}}/M_*=2.7$); they even allow for the bottom-heavy IMF found in
the cores of low-$z$ massive ellipticals. Altogether, our results support a
scenario in which distant quiescent galaxies evolve into nearby massive ETGs,
gradually building up their outskirts and simultaneously losing rotation, due
to a series of (mostly minor) mergers.

*Antti Rantala,Natalia Lahén,Thorsten Naab,Gastón J. Escobar,Giuliano Iorio*

**TL;DR**: 通过高分辨率流体动力学模拟和观测，研究了包含初始双星和三重星的高质量星团的分层组装过程，发现中间质量黑洞（IMBHs）的形成和演化与星团初始质量、表面密度和速度弥散相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 观测和高分辨率流体动力学模拟表明，大质量星团通过复杂的分层组装过程形成。研究旨在探讨初始双星和三重星以及高初始单星质量限制对星团分层组装、结构和运动学的影响。

Data: 使用了包含后牛顿动力学和恒星演化的模拟数据，结合bifrost代码和sevn恒星演化模块，研究了初始恒星质量函数完整的星团。

Method: 采用高分辨率流体动力学模拟，结合后牛顿动力学和恒星演化模型，研究了初始双星和三重星以及高初始单星质量限制对星团演化的影响。

Result: 研究发现，初始多重性或高质量限制会增加中间质量黑洞（IMBHs）的数量和质量，并导致IMBH-IMBH合并。IMBH质量与星团初始质量、表面密度和速度弥散相关，推测JWST观测到的z∼10致密星团中IMBH质量可能超过10^4 M⊙。

Abstract: Observations and high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations indicate that
massive star clusters form through a complex hierarchical assembly. We use
simulations including post-Newtonian dynamics and stellar evolution to
investigate this collisional assembly with the \bifrost{} code coupled to the
\sevn{} stellar evolution module. With a full initial stellar mass function, we
study the effect of initial binary and triple stars as well a high initial
single star mass limit (450 $M_\odot$) on the hierarchical assembly, structure,
and kinematics of massive ($M_\mathrm {cl}\sim10^6 M_\odot$, $N=1.8 \times
10^6$) star clusters. Simultaneously, intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs),
potential seeds for supermassive black holes, can form and grow in our models
by stellar collisions, tidal disruption events (TDEs) and black hole (BH)
mergers. At a fixed cluster mass, stellar multiplicity or a high mass limit
increase the numbers (up to $\sim$ 10) and masses (up to $10^4 M_\odot$) of the
formed IMBHs within the first 10 Myr of cluster evolution. The TDE rates peak
at $\Gamma_\mathrm {tde}\sim 5 \times 10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ shortly after IMBH
formation at $\sim 2$ Myr. In all simulations, we find gravitational wave
driven mergers involving stellar BHs and IMBHs. Initial multiplicity or a high
mass limit also result in IMBH-IMBH mergers. The IMBH masses correlate with the
initial cluster masses, surface densities and velocity dispersions
approximately as $M_\bullet \propto M_\mathrm{cl}$, $M_\bullet \propto
\Sigma_\mathrm{h}^\mathrm{3/2}$ and $M_\bullet \propto \sigma^\mathrm{3}$. Our
results suggest IMBH masses above $M_\bullet \gtrsim 10^4 M_\odot$ for the
dense $z\sim10$ star clusters recently observed by the James Webb Space
Telescope.

*Patricia Iglesias-Navarro,Marc Huertas-Company,Pablo Pérez-González,Johan H. Knapen,ChangHoon Hahn,Anton M. Koekemoer,Steven L. Finkelstein,Natalia Villanueva,Andrés Asensio Ramos*

**TL;DR**: 该研究提出了一种高效的贝叶斯SED拟合框架，用于分析JWST先进深场星系巡天（JADES）的多波长像素测光数据，并成功应用于1083个星系的高分辨率恒星种群性质制图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: JWST先进深场星系巡天（JADES）提供了前所未有的空间分辨率、波长覆盖和深度，但现有方法在处理多波长像素测光数据时存在效率不足的问题。

Data: 研究使用了JADES的多波长像素测光数据，以及基于MILES恒星种群模型生成的合成测光数据。

Method: 采用了基于模拟的贝叶斯推断方法，结合参数化和非参数化的恒星形成历史（SFH）模型，以及JADES类似的滤波器灵敏度阈值。

Result: 研究成功生成了1083个星系的高分辨率恒星种群性质空间分布图，揭示了尘埃或星暴区域，并评估了恒星质量估计中的遮蔽现象，发现其对低质量星系的影响有限。

Abstract: We present an efficient Bayesian SED-fitting framework tailored to
multiwavelength pixel photometry from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic
Survey (JADES). Our method employs simulation-based inference to enable rapid
posterior sampling across galaxy pixels, leveraging the unprecedented spatial
resolution, wavelength coverage, and depth provided by the survey. It is
trained on synthetic photometry generated from MILES stellar population models,
incorporating both parametric and non-parametric SFHs, realistic noise, and
JADES-like filter sensitivity thresholds. We validate this amortised inference
approach on mock datasets, achieving robust and well-calibrated posterior
distributions, with an $R^2$ score of 0.99 for stellar mass. Applying our
pipeline to real observations, we derive spatially resolved maps of stellar
population properties down to $\mathrm{S/N}_{\rm{pixel}}=5$ (averaged over
F277W, F356W, F444W) for 1083 JADES galaxies and ~2 million pixels with
spectroscopic redshifts. These maps enable the identification of dusty or
starburst regions and offer insights into mass growth and the structural
assembly. We assess the outshining phenomenon by comparing pixel-based and
integrated stellar mass estimates, finding limited impact only in low-mass
galaxies ($<10^8M_{\odot}$) but systematic differences of ~0.20 dex linked to
SFH priors. With an average posterior sampling speed of $10^{-4}$ seconds per
pixel and a total inference time of ~1 CPU-day for the full dataset, our model
offers a scalable solution for extracting high-fidelity stellar population
properties from HST+JWST datasets, opening the way for statistical studies at
sub-galactic scales.

### [5] [Long Term Reverberation Mapping of Iron Coronal Lines in MKN 110](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04337)
*Charles Yin,Andy Lawrence,Martin Ward,David Homan,Wolfram Kollatschny*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过长期观测MKN 110活动星系核的[Fe VII]和[Fe X]日冕线通量变化，发现[Fe VII]相对于5100 Å连续谱存在652天的滞后，揭示了日冕线区域的层次结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 活动星系核（AGN）的日冕线（如[Fe VII]和[Fe X]）对极端紫外（EUV）波段的能谱分布（SED）敏感，但现有研究对日冕线区域的物理条件理解有限。

Data: 使用了MKN 110活动星系核的[Fe VII]和[Fe X]日冕线通量数据，时间跨度长达数十年。

Method: 通过长期观测MKN 110的连续谱通量变化，追踪[Fe VII]和[Fe X]通量的响应，并分析其滞后时间。

Result: 发现[Fe VII]相对于5100 Å连续谱存在652天的滞后，而[Fe X]未检测到显著滞后，表明日冕线区域存在层次结构，且部分[Fe VII]通量可能源自更大尺度（10 pc或更远）。

Abstract: We present flux measurements of the coronal lines [Fe VII] and [Fe X]
spanning three decades, in the highly variable Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN)
MKN 110. These coronal lines are sensitive to the spectral energy distribution
(SED) of AGNs in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV). Neither [Fe VII] nor [Fe X]
demonstrates variability in the short term on a weekly or monthly timescale.
However, by taking advantage of a long term decrease in the continuum flux of
MKN 110 on the order of years, we were able to track the [Fe VII] and [Fe X]
fluxes as they respond to the continuum. We were able to detect a lag for [Fe
VII] relative to the continuum at 5100 {\AA}, with a modal lag of 652 days, but
were unable to detect a significant lag in the [Fe x] flux, though there exist
significant uncertainties in the [Fe X] fit. These two lag results are not
consistent and the line widths for the two line species also do not match. This
provides strong evidence for stratification within the coronal line region
(CLR). There is also evidence of a non-varying component within the coronal
line flux, probably a result of a more extended region of origin. Taken
together, these results suggest a CLR where the bulk of the [Fe VII] originates
on parsec scales, but a portion of the [Fe VII] flux originates further out, at
or beyond a 10 pc scale. These results also indicate the limitations of
single-cloud models in describing the physical conditions of the CLR.

**TL;DR**: 本文通过分析GRB 240218A的余辉光谱，首次详细表征了红移z>6.5的星系中性气体特性，揭示了早期宇宙中金属和尘埃快速积累以及大量中性氢储层的普遍性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 大爆炸后第一个十亿年内星系的化学特性是当前天体物理学的核心目标之一。长伽马射线暴（GRBs）的光学/近红外光谱被认为是探测其宿主星系星际介质及其金属和尘埃含量的有效手段，直至最高红移。

Data: 本文使用了GRB 240218A（红移z=6.782）的VLT/X-shooter余辉光谱数据。

Method: 通过分析余辉光谱中的中性氢、低电离、高电离和精细结构吸收线，确定了金属丰度、运动学和化学丰度模式。

Result: 研究发现宿主星系的中性氢柱密度极高（log(N(HI)/cm−2)=22.5±0.3），金属柱密度也异常高（log(N(ZnII)/cm−2)>14.3），金属丰度为[Zn/H]>-0.8，并存在大量尘埃消耗和铝过丰现象。这些结果与ALMA和JWST揭示的极高红移星系电离气体特性一致，表明早期宇宙中金属和尘埃快速积累以及大量中性氢储层是普遍现象。

Abstract: The chemical characterization of galaxies in the first billion years after
the Big Bang is one of the central goals of current astrophysics.
Optical/near-infrared spectroscopy of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been
heralded as an effective diagnostic to probe the interstellar medium of their
host galaxies and their metal and dust content, up to the highest redshift. An
opportunity to fulfill this expectation was provided by the recent blast
triggered by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory of GRB 240218A at redshift
z=6.782. We study a high-redshift galaxy selected in a complementary way with
respect to flux-limited surveys, not depending on galaxy luminosity and stellar
mass. We present the VLT/X-shooter spectrum of its afterglow enabling the
detection of neutral-hydrogen, low-ionization, high-ionization and
fine-structure absorption lines. We determine the metallicity, kinematics and
chemical abundance pattern, providing the first detailed characterization of
the neutral gas of a galaxy at z>6.5. From the analysis of fine-structure lines
we estimate the distance of the closest gas clouds as
$d_{II}=620^{+230}_{-140}$ pc. We determine a high neutral hydrogen column
density, $\log(N(HI)/cm^{-2})=22.5\pm0.3$, which is the highest one at z>6
determined so far for a GRB host galaxy, as well as a surprisingly high metal
column density, $\log(N(ZnII)/cm^{-2})>14.3$. The observed metallicity of the
host galaxy system is [Zn/H]>-0.8. We find evidence of a high amount of dust
depletion and of aluminum overabundance, although a number of transitions are
saturated. The high hydrogen column density, metal abundances and dust
depletion in the neutral gas align with those of the ionized gas of very
high-redshift galaxies unveiled by ALMA and JWST, testifying that a rapid build
up of metals and dust, and massive neutral hydrogen reservoirs seem to be
common features of galaxies in the early Universe.

### [7] [JWST Insights into Narrow-line Little Red Dots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04350)
*Zijian Zhang,Linhua Jiang,Weiyang Liu,Luis C. Ho,Kohei Inayoshi*

**TL;DR**: 研究利用JWST观测到的红点天体（LRDs）中无宽H-alpha成分的样本，发现它们可能是高恒星质量和恒星形成率的尘埃致密星系，或处于早期超爱丁顿增长阶段的低质量AGN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: JWST发现了一类红点天体（LRDs），其光谱特征为V形SED，多数具有宽Balmer线，表明可能为AGN。本研究关注无宽H-alpha成分的LRDs。

Data: 使用JWST的NIRSpec高或中分辨率光栅光谱覆盖H-alpha的32个LRDs样本，从中选出5个z~5的LRDs。

Method: 通过SED建模分析LRDs的性质，比较其与正常恒星形成星系及AGN的关系。

Result: 无宽H-alpha的LRDs可能是高恒星质量和恒星形成率的尘埃致密星系，或低质量AGN；这些AGN可能处于早期超爱丁顿增长阶段，黑洞质量略高于本地MBH-Mstar关系。

Abstract: James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a population of red and
compact objects with a unique V-shape SED at z >= 4 known as Little Red Dots
(LRDs). Most of the LRDs with existing spectral observations exhibit broad
Balmer lines and are thus likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we
present a study of LRDs with no broad H-alpha component. Our sample consists of
five LRDs at z~5 with H-alpha line widths of about 250 km/s. They are selected
from 32 LRDs that have NIRSpec high- or medium-resolution grating spectra
covering H-alpha. During our construction of the sample, we find that
approximately 20 percent of the LRD candidates previously selected do not show
red continuum emission but resemble the V-shape spectra due to strong line
emission. Compared to normal star-forming galaxies, narrow-line LRDs tend to
have relatively higher H-alpha line widths and luminosities. If these LRDs are
dominated by galaxies, our SED modeling suggests that they are dusty, compact
star-forming galaxies with high stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs).
Alternatively, if their SEDs are produced by AGNs, the inferred central black
hole masses (MBH) are in the range of 10^5 to 10^6 solar masses, placing them
at the low-mass end of the AGN population. They may represent an early stage of
super-Eddington growth, where the black holes have yet to accumulate
significant masses. With large measurement uncertainties, these black holes
appear slightly overmassive relative to the local MBH-Mstar relation, but
consistent or undermassive with respect to the MBH-sigma and MBH-Mdyn
relations. We further find that nearly half of the high-redshift broad-line
AGNs exhibit V-shape SEDs. (abridged)

**TL;DR**: 研究利用中国空间站望远镜（CSST）的模拟成像数据开发了一种结合传统图像搜索技术和机器学习分类模型的管道，用于检测和分类局部体积内的矮星系，显著提高了检测极限。


<details>

Background: 识别局部体积内的矮星系对于限制附近宇宙中卫星星系的光度函数至关重要。目前的研究需要更高效的检测方法。

Data: 研究使用了中国空间站望远镜（CSST）的模拟成像数据。

Method: 开发了一个检测和分类管道，结合了传统的图像搜索技术和预训练的ViT-Base机器学习分类模型，包括扩展源检测的预处理方法。

Result: 该管道在真阳性率（TPR）超过85%且假阳性率（FPR）仅为0.1%的情况下，能够检测到绝对星等为-7的矮星系，并在20兆秒差距内识别矮星系。

Abstract: Identifying dwarf galaxies within the Local Volume is crucial for
constraining the luminosity function of satellite galaxies in the nearby
universe. We report the detection capabilities of dwarf galaxies within the
Local Volume using the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST). Based on the
simulated imaging data of CSST, we develop a detection and classification
pipeline that combines traditional image-based search techniques with advanced
machine learning classification models. The simulated Local Volume dwarf
galaxies can be identified using a pre-processing method for "extended source
detection", followed by classification with a pretrained ViT-Base model. This
pipeline achieves a true positive rate (TPR) exceeding 85% with a false
positive rate (FPR) of only 0.1%. We quantify the detection completeness of
Local Volume dwarf galaxies across a three-dimensional parameter space defined
by absolute magnitude ($M_V$), half-light radius ($R_h$), and heliocentric
distance, based on simulated single-exposure CSST wide-field imaging survey
data. For unresolved or semi-resolved dwarf galaxies, our method achieves a
significantly deeper absolute magnitude detection limit compared to
catalog-based approaches, reaching $M_V = -7$ within 10 \Mpc. By combining this
image-based approach with traditional stellar catalog-based "matched filter"
techniques, our automated framework established in this work can identify dwarf
galaxies within 20 \Mpc for the CSST mission.

*Pranav Satheesh,Laura Blecha,Luke Zoltan Kelley*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过宇宙学模拟发现，强三重黑洞相互作用显著增加黑洞合并比例，并影响引力波反冲和弹弓效应的黑洞逃逸现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系合并形成的大质量黑洞双星（MBHBs）是宇宙中最强的引力波源之一；若双星螺旋时间较长，后续星系合并可能引入第三个黑洞形成三重系统。

Data: 使用了Illustris宇宙学模拟中的数据，特别是其中6%在秒差距尺度上形成强三重系统的MBHBs。

Method: 应用了三重MBHs的数值模拟结果，分析了强三重系统对MBH合并和反冲的影响。

Result: 强三重相互作用使总体合并比例增加4%，并将强三重系统中MBH的合并比例从40%提高到69%；引力波反冲和弹弓效应均可导致黑洞逃逸，但前者在随机自旋假设下主导逃逸现象。

Abstract: Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) form through galaxy mergers and are among
the loudest sources of gravitational waves (GWs) in the universe. If the binary
inspiral time is long, a subsequent galaxy merger can introduce a third black
hole, forming a triple system. In the Illustris cosmological simulation, 6% of
MBHBs form such triples at parsec scales, where strong three-body interactions
are likely. We apply results from numerical simulations of triple MBHs to
strong triples identified in Illustris to assess their impact on MBH mergers
and recoils. We find that strong triple interactions increase the overall
merger fraction by 4%. Including triple interactions raises the merger fraction
of MBHs in strong triple systems from 40% to 69%, relative to modeling binary
evolution in isolation. Furthermore, massive, major mergers are over three
times more likely to be facilitated by strong triple interactions than mergers
in general. We also compare GW recoil kicks to gravitational slingshot kicks
from triple interactions. Both mechanisms can produce kicks exceeding host
escape speeds, ejecting MBHs and producing wandering or offset black holes.
Although slingshots yield the highest velocity kicks, GW recoils dominate the
ejected population when assuming random MBH spin orientations. Under this
assumption, ejections from GW recoil and slingshot kicks reduce the total
number of mergers by 6%. Our results highlight the impact of strong triple
dynamics and GW recoils on MBH evolution and support their inclusion in
cosmological simulations.

**TL;DR**: 通过分析本地宇宙中活动星系核的X射线光谱变化，研究发现超过一半的源显示出视线柱密度变化，且Seyfert 1和Seyfert 2星系的变化比例相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 活动星系核（AGN）中遮蔽物质的特性可以通过测量视线柱密度（N_H,los）随时间的变化来研究，但这种方法通常资源密集且只能针对少数目标进行。因此，目前最佳选择是基于现有档案数据进行群体统计研究。

Data: 使用了Chandra望远镜对43个Seyfert 1和Seyfert 2星系的多重观测数据。

Method: 通过分析X射线光谱变化来估计视线柱密度的变化，并比较不同时间尺度下的变化频率。

Result: 研究发现本地宇宙中54±11%的源显示出视线柱密度变化，且Seyfert 1和Seyfert 2星系的变化比例相似（Seyfert 1约为61%，Seyfert 2约为47%）。此外，还发现更长的观测时间尺度下变化更频繁。

Abstract: The nature of the obscuring material in active galactic nuclei (AGN) can be
studied by measuring changes in the line-of-sight column density, $N_{\rm
H,los}$, over time. This can be accomplished by monitoring AGN over long
periods of time and at all timescales. However, this can only be done for a few
selected objects as it is resource intensive. Therefore, the best option
currently is to focus on population statistics based on the available archival
data. In this work, we estimate a lower limit on the fraction of sources in the
local $(z<0.1)$ universe that display spectral variability among observations
($54\pm11$%), indicative of $N_{\rm H,los}$ variability. Interestingly, we also
find that the variable fraction is similar for both Seyfert 1 ($f_{\rm
Sy1}\sim61^{+13}_{-15}$%) and Seyfert 2 ($f_{\rm Sy2}\sim47\pm15$%) galaxies,
and discuss why we might find a slightly higher $f_{\rm Sy1}$. We also present
a sample of 43 Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies with multiple Chandra
observations whose properties make them promising $N_{\rm H,los}$-variable
targets. We discuss the accuracy of our method, and search for potential
dependencies on the timescale between variable and non-variable observation
pairs within a given source. In agreement with previous studies, we find
evidence that more variability occurs on longer timescales than on shorter
timescales.

Data: 使用了6215个位于低银河纬度（b <= 6度）的疏散星团的星际消光数据。

Method: 通过将疏散星团样本按银河经度划分为多个子区域，分析其星际消光分布，并计算红化平面的特征参数。

Result: 研究发现红化平面与银河平面不完全对齐，而是呈正弦波动；星际吸收在银河经度42度和222度分别达到最大值和最小值；星际物质分布存在明显的南北不对称性；太阳位于红化平面上方15.7 +/- 7.3 pc；红化平面的尘埃层平均厚度约为201 +/- 20 pc。

Abstract: As thousands of new open clusters in the Galaxy have recently been reported
with reddening or extinction information, we map the distribution and
properties of the Galaxy's interstellar material in the Galactic disk as traced
by these open clusters. By analyzing the distribution of interstellar
extinction for 6215 open clusters located at low Galactic latitude b <= 6 deg,
corresponding to the thin Galactic disk, we identify a reddening plane
characterized by a dust layer whose thickness varies with Galactic longitude.
By splitting the open clusters sample into several sub-regions of Galactic
longitude, we observe that the reddening plane is not perfectly aligned with
the formal Galactic plane, but instead varies sinusoidally around the Galactic
mid-plane. The maximum and minimum interstellar absorption occur at
approximately 42 deg and 222 deg, respectively, along the Galactic longitude.
Our analysis reveals a noticeable north-south asymmetry in the distribution of
interstellar absorption, with a higher proportion of interstellar material
below the Galactic plane. We also find that the Sun is located 15.7 +/- 7.3 pc
above the reddening plane. The scale height of the open clusters from the
reddening plane is estimated to be z_h = 87.3 +/- 1.8 pc. The mean thickness of
the absorbing material in the reddening plane, which represents the average
extent of the dust layer responsible for interstellar extinction, is found to
be about 201 +/- 20 pc. Our findings provide insights into the distribution of
interstellar dust, its relationship with the Galactic thin disk, and its
implications for the Galactic structure.

### [12] [RIDEN pilot survey: broad-band selection of candidate quasars with extended Lyman-$α$ nebulae using CLAUDS-HSC-SSP-DUNES$^2$ joint data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04570)
*Rhythm Shimakawa,Satoshi Kikuta,Haruka Kusakabe,Marcin Sawicki,Yongming Liang,Rieko Momose,Stephen Gwyn,Guillaume Desprez*

**TL;DR**: The study uses multi-band imaging data to identify candidate quasar nebulae and examines their Lyα morphology and environmental dependence, highlighting the potential of the Rubin LSST for future discoveries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's LSST will provide deep, multi-band imaging data, but prior to this, the study utilized existing surveys (HSC-SSP, CLAUDS, DUNES²) to investigate quasar nebulae.

Data: The study used deep, wide-field ultraviolet to near-infrared data from HSC-SSP, CLAUDS, DUNES², and additional public data covering 13 square degrees.

Method: Broad-band Lyα imaging was employed to select candidate quasar nebulae, and their morphology and environmental dependence were analyzed.

Result: No significant differences in Lyα nebula asymmetry were found between redshift intervals, and no systematic environmental differences were observed, though the most extended nebula was in a high-density region.

Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will conduct the Legacy Survey of Space and
Time (LSST), delivering deep, multi-band ($ugrizy$) imaging data across 18,000
square degrees over the next decade. Before this ultra-wide-field survey, we
constructed a broad-band Ly$\alpha$ imaging toward 483 SDSS/BOSS quasars at
$z=$ 1.9-3.0, using deep, wide-field ultraviolet to near-infrared ($u$-to-$K$)
data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Survey (HSC-SSP), the CFHT
Large Area U-band Deep Survey (CLAUDS), the Deep UKIRT Near-Infrared Steward
Survey (DUNES$^2$), and additional public data covering 13 square degrees. Our
broad-band selection allowed us to select 24 candidate quasar nebulae that
exhibit $u$ or $g$ band excess over 50-170 kpc, some of which exhibit
asymmetrical extended features similar to those seen in previously discovered
giant nebulae. We then investigated whether the Ly$\alpha$ morphology of quasar
nebulae differs between two redshift intervals, $z=$ 1.9-2.3 and $z=$ 2.3-3.0,
and examined environmental dependence based on a control sample. Comparison
results show no significant difference in asymmetry within Ly$\alpha$ nebulae
between the two redshift intervals. Furthermore, we found no systematic
differences in overdensities around the complete quasar samples, quasars with
large Ly$\alpha$ nebulae, and control samples, while the most extended nebula
appears to be located in the high-density region. Further verification analyses
are required since the current dataset lacks spectroscopic confirmation for
both quasar nebulae and their surrounding neighbours. Nevertheless, the results
demonstrate the great potential of the Rubin LSST to discover giant Ly$\alpha$
nebulae on an unprecedented scale.

Background: 引力波天文学的革命性进展带来了对黑洞合并和中子星碰撞等宇宙灾难性事件的观测，但引力波数据的庞大体积和复杂性对传统分析方法提出了挑战。

Data: 使用了2021年至2024年的引力波数据。

Abstract: The advent of gravitational wave astronomy (GW) has revolutionized the
observation of cataclysmic cosmic events, such as black hole mergers and
neutron star collisions. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
Observatory (LIGO) has been at the forefront of these discoveries. However, the
immense volume and complexity of gravitational wave data present significant
challenges for traditional analysis methods. This paper investigates the
growing synergy between artificial intelligence (AI) and GW science,
emphasizing how AI enhances signal detection, noise reduction, and data
interpretation. It begins with an overview of GW fundamentals and the role of
machine learning in increasing detector sensitivity. Notable GW events observed
by LIGO are discussed alongside persistent analytical challenges such as data
quality, generalization, and computational constraints. A comprehensive
performance review of AI techniques, including supervised learning,
unsupervised learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, is presented
based on data spanning 2021 to 2024. Evaluation metrics include accuracy,
precision, true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), and
computational efficiency. Findings indicate that deep learning and supervised
learning outperform other approaches, particularly in enhancing TPR and
minimizing FPR. While unsupervised and reinforcement learning models offer less
precision, they demonstrate high efficiency and potential for real-time
applications. The study also explores AI integration into next-generation
detectors and waveform reconstruction techniques. Overall, the integration of
AI into GW research significantly improves the reliability and speed of event
detection, unlocking new possibilities for exploring the dynamic universe. This
paper provides a comprehensive outlook on the transformative role of AI in
shaping the future of GW astronomy.

**TL;DR**: 利用Gaia DR3数据揭示了银河系内盘Z-VZ相空间中的双臂相位螺旋新特征，并提出多重外部扰动机制解释这些特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 近期研究利用Gaia DR3数据揭示了银河系内盘Z-VZ相空间中的双臂相位螺旋现象，但对其形成机制和特征仍需进一步探索。

Data: 使用Gaia DR3 RVS星表数据，基于Jφ（或Rg）和θφ进行分段分析。

Method: 通过分段分析Gaia DR3数据，并结合测试粒子模拟，研究双臂相位螺旋的特征和形成机制。

Result: 发现银河系内盘存在清晰的双臂相位螺旋，并在稍大半径处观察到不同的双臂模式；模拟结果表明银河系可能受到两个卫星星系的双重扰动，且早期扰动痕迹未被完全覆盖。

Abstract: Recent studies using the Gaia DR3 data have revealed a two-armed phase spiral
in the $Z-V_Z$ phase space in the inner disk. In this study, we present new
features of the two-armed phase spiral revealed by the Gaia Data and a new
mechanism to explain such features with multiple external perturbations. By
segmenting the Gaia DR3 RVS catalog based on $J_{\phi}$ (or $R_{g}$) and
$\theta_\phi$, we confirm the existence of the clear two-armed phase spiral in
the inner disk. Moreover, we identify a different two-armed phase spiral
pattern at slightly larger radii, resembling a weak secondary branch along with
the prominent major branch. At a given radius, with the azimuthal angle
increasing, we observe a systematic transition of the two-armed phase spiral,
with the significance of one branch weakened and another branch enhanced. This
two-armed phase spiral may be due to the overlapping of distinct one-armed
phase spirals. At different radii, the perturbation times estimated from each
branch of the two-armed phase spiral are $\sim 320$ Myr and $\sim 500$ Myr,
respectively, suggesting that the Galactic disk could be impacted by double
external perturbers separated by $\sim 180$ Myr. We also performed test
particle simulations of the disk perturbed by two satellite galaxies, which
successfully generated a two-armed phase spiral similar to the observation.
Both the observation and simulation results suggest that the signature in the
$Z-V_Z$ phase space of earlier perturbations may not be completely erased by
the more recent one.

**TL;DR**: 研究人员利用ALMA Band 3光谱扫描发现了一个红移约为3.9的原星系团，确认其为一个高光度射电星系，并揭示了其分子气体的动力学特征及周围星系成员的存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 高红移射电星系及其宿主星系的研究对于理解星系形成和演化具有重要意义，但目前对这类天体的观测和研究仍存在不足。

Data: 使用了Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) Band 3的光谱扫描数据，以及GLEAM、HAWK-I Ks波段和Dark Energy Survey的多波段测光数据。

Method: 通过ALMA Band 3的光谱扫描检测CO(4-3)和[CI](1-0)发射线，并结合多波段测光数据进行分析。

Result: 发现了一个红移为3.879的高光度射电星系，其分子气体显示出动力学分离的特征，并确认了周围的原星系团成员，其中包括一个罕见的光学暗且质量极大的星系。

Abstract: We report the discovery of a $z\sim3.9$ protocluster identified from Atacama
Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array Band 3 spectral scans of a bright radio
source selected from the GaLactic and Extra-galactic All-sky Murchison
Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey. Extended CO(4-3) and [CI](1-0) line emission
was detected in GLEAM J005332$-$325630 confirming it to be a $z=3.879$ powerful
radio galaxy with luminosity, $L_{500 MHz}=1.3\times10^{28}$ ${W Hz}^{-1}$.
This source is part of a sample of candidate high redshift radio galaxies with
bright radio fluxes, $S_{150MHz}>0.1$ Jy, but host galaxies with
$K_s({AB})\gtrsim23$ mag. The molecular gas associated with the radio galaxy
host has two kinematically separate components, likely in-falling and
indicative of a recent interaction or merger with another galaxy. One 100-GHz
continuum source $\sim120$ pkpc away is found to have both CO(4-3) and
[CI](1-0) emission lines and a further five protocluster members are identified
from CO(4-3) emission alone, all at similar redshift ($\Delta v<700$ km
s$^{-1}$) and within a radius of $1.1^{\prime}$. Using photometry from the High
Acuity Widefield K-band Imager $K_s$-band and the Dark Energy Survey $g, r, i,
z$ and $Y$ bands, we find this protocluster harbours a rare, optically-dark,
very massive $M_*\sim10^{12}$ ${M}_\odot$ galaxy. Comparisons with the TNG300
cosmological simulation puts this galaxy in a dark matter halo of
$M_{DM}\sim3\times10^{13}$ ${M}_\odot$ which will evolve into a Coma-like DM
halo ($M_{DM}\sim10^{15}$ ${M}_\odot$) by the present day.

**TL;DR**: 通过三维流体动力学模拟研究了M31*（仙女座星系中心超大质量黑洞）通过周围核星团恒星质量损失供应的机制，发现其吸积率和X射线光度与观测一致。

Background: 仙女座星系中心的超大质量黑洞M31*电磁辐射微弱，吸积率极低，但其质量约为10^8太阳质量。研究探索了M31*通过周围核星团恒星质量损失供应的新机制。

Data: 使用核星团中100颗渐近巨星分支恒星的慢冷风作为质量注入源，质量注入率约为4×10^-5太阳质量每年。

Method: 采用三维流体动力学模拟，研究了M31*通过核星团恒星质量损失供应的机制，模拟时间尺度为2百万年。

Result: 模拟结果显示形成了一个准开普勒冷气体盘，吸积率约为2×10^-5太阳质量每年，预测的X射线光度约为10^36 erg每秒，与钱德拉观测一致。

Abstract: The central supermassive black hole (SMBH) of the Andromeda galaxy, known as
M31*, exhibits dim electromagnetic emission and is inferred to have an
extremely low accretion rate for its remarkable mass ($\sim10^8~\rm~M_\odot$).
In this work, we use three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations to explore a
previously untested scenario, in which M31* is fed by the collective stellar
mass-loss from its surrounding nuclear star cluster, manifested as a famous
eccentric disk of predominantly old stellar populations. The stellar mass-loss
is assumed to be dominated by the slow and cold winds from 100 asymptotic
giant-branch stars, which follow well-constrained Keplerian orbits around M31*
and together provide a mass injection rate of
$\sim4\times10^{-5}\rm~M_\odot~yr^{-1}$. The simulations achieve a quasi-steady
state on a Myr timescale, at which point a quasi-Keplerian, cool
($T\sim10^3-10^4~\rm K$) gas disk extending several parsecs is established.
This disk is continuously supplied by the stellar winds and itself feeds the
central SMBH. At the end of the simulations at 2 Myr, an accretion rate of
$\sim2\times10^{-5}\rm~M_\odot~yr^{-1}$ is found but could vary by a factor of
few depending on whether the subdominant gravity of the NSC or a moderate
global inflow is included. The predicted X-ray luminosity of $\sim10^{36}~\rm
erg~s^{-1}$, dominated by the hot ($T\sim10^7-10^8~\rm K$) plasma within 0.2
parsec of the SMBH, is well consistent with Chandra observations. We conclude
that the feeding mechanism of M31* is successfully identified, which has
important implications for the working of dormant SMBHs prevalent in the local
universe.

**TL;DR**: 研究了C(3P)与乙醛（CH3CHO）在50-296 K温度范围内的反应动力学，发现其速率常数大且与温度无关，对星际化学中乙醛丰度有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 原子碳C(3P)在基态电子态下的反应在星际化学中非常重要，因为碳原子丰度高。本研究旨在探讨C(3P)与乙醛的反应动力学及其对星际化学的影响。

Data: 实验使用了超音速流动反应器，结合脉冲激光光解生成C原子，以及真空紫外范围内的脉冲激光诱导荧光检测C(3P)和H(2S)原子。

Method: 实验采用超音速流动反应器和脉冲激光技术，同时进行了量子化学计算以支持实验结果。

Result: 反应速率常数平均为4.0 x 10-10 cm3 s-1，与温度无关；理论计算表明反应势能面上几乎没有能垒。该反应显著降低了星际云中乙醛的气相丰度。

Abstract: Reactions involving atomic carbon in its ground electronic state, C(3P), play
an important role in astrochemistry due to high C-atom abundance levels. Here
we performed a kinetic investigation of the reaction between C(3P) and
acetaldehyde, CH3CHO, determining rate constants for this process over the
50-296 K range. Measurements of the formation of atomic hydrogen, H(2S), were
also performed to provide insight into product formation. Experiments were
conducted using a supersonic flow reactor coupled with pulsed laser photolysis
for C-atom generation and pulsed laser induced fluorescence in the vacuum
ultraviolet range for the detection of both C(3P) and H(2S) atoms. Quantum
chemical calculations of the ground triplet state potential energy surface of
C3H4O were also performed to provide theoretical support for the measurements.
The rate constants were large and temperature independent with an average value
of 4.0 x 10-10 cm3 s-1. This result is consistent with the theoretical results
which predict either very low barriers or none at all on the underlying
potential energy surface. Although experimental difficulties prevented the
quantitative determination of H-atom formation, qualitatively, H-atom yields
were very low with CH3CH/C2H4 + CO as the major products based on the
calculations. The influence of this reaction on interstellar chemistry was
tested using a gas-grain model of dense interstellar clouds. These simulations
predict that the C(3P) + CH3CHO reaction decreases gas-phase CH3CHO abundances
by more than an order of magnitude at early and intermediate cloud ages, with a
lower influence at typical dense cloud ages.

Background: 星系团合并是宇宙中最剧烈的事件之一，但其对星系性质的影响尚未被充分理解。本研究旨在探讨合并环境对附近星系团中恒星形成的影响。

Data: 研究使用了来自SAMI星系巡天（A168、A2399、A3380和EDCC 0442）和斯隆数字巡天（SDSS）的单光纤光谱数据。

Method: 通过SAMI星系团红移巡天（SAMI-CRS）和SDSS的光谱特征识别恒星形成星系（SFG）群体，追踪星系团样本中的恒星形成活动。

Result: 研究发现合并星系团中恒星形成星系比例（f_SFG）有轻微增加，但不显著；Hα线等效宽度分析未显示恒星形成活动与动力学状态之间的强相关性，表明f_SFG的增加是由于星系在动态复杂的年轻合并系统中的混合所致。

Abstract: Being the most energetic events in the known universe, the impact of galaxy
cluster mergers on the properties of the resident galaxies has yet to be
well-understood. In this paper, we investigate the effects of merging
environments on star formation in nearby clusters ($0.04<z<0.06$) from the SAMI
Galaxy Survey - A168, A2399, A3380, and EDCC 0442 - which exhibit different
dynamical activity. Using single-fiber spectroscopy from the SAMI Cluster
Redshift Survey (SAMI-CRS) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we trace star
formation (SF) activity across the cluster sample by identifying the
star-forming galaxy (SFG) population based on spectral features. We find a mild
enhancement in the star-forming galaxy fraction $f_{SFG}$ in merging clusters,
although not statistically significant. The spatial and projected phase-space
distributions show that SFGs in merging clusters are well-mixed with the
passive population, while galaxy populations exhibit a clear segregation in the
relaxed clusters. Analysis of equivalent width of $\rm H\alpha$ line (EW($\rm
H\alpha$)), as a tracer of recent SF activity, does not reveal strong evidence
of triggered star formation activity as a function of dynamical state for both
the global cluster environment and subsamples of galaxies selected near
possible merger features. This suggests that the increase in $f_{SFG}$ is due
to the mixing of galaxies in dynamically complex, young merging systems that
are still forming, unlike their older, relaxed counterparts that have had
longer to quench.

**TL;DR**: 本文通过形态学、动力学和运动学分析，结合DESI Legacy Survey和GAIA数据，研究了NGC 5634的起源，发现其轨道特征与Sgr流关联性较弱，更可能与GSE或Helmi流相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: NGC 5634的起源尚不明确，此前研究推测其可能与Sgr流有关，但缺乏形态学和动力学证据支持。

Data: DESI Legacy Survey数据用于确定NGC 5634的基本参数（年龄、金属丰度、距离模数），GAIA数据用于分析其轨道特征。

Method: 通过匹配滤波模板搜索NGC 5634的额外潮汐结构，并结合GAIA数据对其轨道进行长期积分分析，同时在Lz-E空间进行动力学比较。

Result: 未检测到NGC 5634与Sgr流相关的显著潮汐结构，其轨道特征与Sgr流差异较大，更接近GSE或Helmi流，表明其起源可能与后者相关。

Abstract: We investigate the origin of NGC 5634 through a comprehensive analysis of its
morphology, kinematics and dynamics. Utilizing data from the DESI Legacy
Survey, we refined its fundamental parameters (age t = 12.8 +/- 0.3 Gyr,
metallicity [Fe/H] = -1.8 +/- 0.1 dex, distance modulus dm = 17.0 +/- 0.1 mag)
and constructed matched-filter template based on the combination of these
parameters to search for extra-tidal structures. However, no significant
features were detected above a 3 sigma signal-to-noise threshold, which limits
our ability to further investigate the association between NGC 5634 and the
Sagittarius (Sgr) stream based on morphological evidence. Incorporating GAIA
data, we further examine the orbital path of NGC 5634. We found that its orbit
only briefly intersects with the Sgr stream and diverges significantly over
long-term integrations. This behavior contrasts with that of confirmed
Sgr-associated clusters, whose orbits remain closely aligned with the stream
throughout their orbital evolution. Additionally, NGC 5634 exhibits a
relatively shorter semi-major axis and smaller apocenter and pericenter
distances compared to Sgr clusters. These orbital characteristics are more
consistent with clusters associated with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) or
the Helmi streams. From a dynamical perspective, in the Lz-E space, NGC 5634 is
also distinctly different from Sgr clusters and aligns more closely with the
GSE and Helmi regions. Taken together, these findings do not support a strong
connection between NGC 5634 and the Sgr dSph, but instead suggest a potential
association with another progenitor system, such as GSE or Helmi stream.
Nevertheless, further evidence is needed to definitively establish its origin.

Abstract: Wide Binaries (WBs) are interesting systems to test Newton-Einstein gravity
in low potentials. The basic concept is to verify whether the difference in
velocity between the WB components is compatible with what is expected from the
Newton law. Previous attempts, based solely on Gaia proper motion differences
scaled to transverse velocity differences using mean parallax distances, do not
provide conclusive results. Here we add to the Gaia transverse velocities
precise measurements of the third velocity component, the radial velocity (RV),
in order to identify multiple stars, and to improve the reliability of the test
by using velocity differences and positions in three dimensions. We use the
HARPS spectra to determine accurate RV difference between the WB components,
correcting the observed velocities for gravitational redshift and convective
shift. We exploit the Gaia distance distributions to determine the projected
and intrinsic separations s and r and the 3-dimensional velocity differences of
the binaries. Of the 44 pairs observed with HARPS, 27% show sign of
multiplicity or are not suitable for the test, and 32 bona-fide WBs survive our
selection. Their projected separation s is up to 14 kAU, or 0.06 parsec. We
determine distances, eccentricities and position angles to reproduce the
velocity differences according to Newton's law, finding reasonable solutions
for all WBs but one, and with some systems possibly too near pericenter and/or
at too high inclination. Our (limited) number of WBs does not show obvious
trends with separation or acceleration and is consistent with Newtonian
dynamics. We are collecting a larger sample of this kind to robustly assess
these results.

**TL;DR**: This study analyzes the JWST-NIRSpec spectrum of the protoplanetary disk d203-506, detecting CH radical and likely H3+ molecular ion, highlighting the impact of UV radiation on disk chemistry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Protoplanetary disks are often exposed to strong UV radiation from nearby massive stars, which significantly alters their chemistry by producing radicals and molecular ions.

Data: The study uses JWST-NIRSpec spectrum data of the protoplanetary disk d203-506 from the PDRs4All Early Release Science program.

Method: A multi-molecule fitting tool, PAHTATmol, was developed and used to analyze the spectrum and detect species.

Result: The study reports clear detection of CH radical and likely detection of H3+ molecular ion, with abundances of a few times 10^-7 and approximately 10^-8, respectively, supporting UV-driven chemistry in irradiated disks.

Abstract: Most protoplanetary disks experience a phase in which they are subjected to
strong ultraviolet radiation from nearby massive stars. This UV radiation can
substantially alter their chemistry by producing numerous radicals and
molecular ions. In this Letter we present detailed analysis of the JWST-NIRSpec
spectrum of the d203-506 obtained as part of the PDRs4All Early Release Science
program. Using state-of-the-art spectroscopic data, we searched for species
using a multi-molecule fitting tool, PAHTATmol, that we developed for this
purpose. Based on this analysis, we report the clear detection of
ro-vibrational emission of the CH radical and likely detection of the H$_3^+$
molecular ion, with estimated abundances of a few times 10$^{-7}$ and
approximately 10$^{-8}$, respectively. The presence of CH is predicted by
gas-phase models and well explained by hydrocarbon photochemistry. H$_3^+$ is
usually formed through reactions of H$_2$ with H$_2^+$ originating from cosmic
ray ionization of H$_2$. However, recent theoretical studies suggest that
H$_3^+$ also forms through UV-driven chemistry in strongly irradiated
($G_0>$10$^3$), dense ($n_{\rm H} >10^{6}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas. The latter is
favored as an explanation for the presence of ``hot'' H$_3^+$ ($T_{\rm
ex}\gtrsim$1000 K) in the outer disk layers of d203-506, coinciding with the
emission of FUV-pumped H$_2$ and other ``PDR species'', such as CH$^+$,
CH$_3^+$, and OH. Our detection of infrared emission from vibrationally excited
H$_3^+$ and CH raises questions about their excitation mechanisms and,
underscore that UV radiation can have a profound impact on the chemistry of
planet forming disks. They also demonstrate the power of JWST pushing the limit
for the detection of elusive species in protoplanetary disks.

*Javier R. Goicoechea,Octavio Roncero,Evelyne Roueff,John H. Black,Ilane Schroetter,Olivier Berné*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过详细的光解离区域（PDR）模型，揭示了在强外部远紫外辐射下，H3+的形成主要受FUV驱动反应而非宇宙射线电离的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: JWST观测到d203-506盘中的振动激发H3+发射，引发了关于宇宙射线电离是否在星团形成区域的盘中增强，或其他机制是否参与H3+形成和激发的讨论。

Data: 研究使用了光解离区域（PDR）模型，分析了H3+的形成和激发过程。

Method: 通过详细的状态-状态动力学计算，研究了H2与HOC+和H+的反应，并考虑了振动激发H2的photoionization效应。

Result: 研究发现FUV驱动的反应在强辐射盘的光解离区域中主导H3+的形成，H3+丰度峰值约为10^-8，且与HOC+丰度高的区域一致。

Abstract: The likely JWST detection of vibrationally excited H3+ emission in the
irradiated disk d203-506, reported by Schroetter et al., raises the question of
whether cosmic-ray ionization is enhanced in disks within clustered
star-forming regions, or if alternative mechanisms contribute to H3+ formation
and excitation. We present a detailed model of the photodissociation region
(PDR) component of a protoplanetary disk-comprising the outer disk surface and
the photoevaporative wind-exposed to strong external far-ultraviolet (FUV)
radiation. We investigate key gas-phase reactions involving excited H2 that
lead to the formation of H3+ in the PDR, including detailed state-to-state
dynamical calculations of reactions H2 + HOC+ -> H3+ + CO and H2 + H+ -> H2+ +
H. We also consider the effects of photoionization of vibrationally excited
H2(v>=4), a process that has not previously been included in disk models. We
find that these FUV-driven reactions dominate the formation of H3+ in the PDR
of strongly irradiated disks, largely independently of cosmic-ray ionization.
The predicted H3+ abundance peaks at x(H3+)~10^-8, coinciding with regions
where HOC+ is also abundant. The high abundances of H3+ and HOC+ are ultimately
linked to the strength of the external FUV field (G0), the presence of C+, and
an enhanced reservoir of hot H2O. The predicted H3+ column densities (~10^13
cm^-2) are consistent with the presence of H3+ in the PDR of irradiated disks.
We also find that formation pumping, resulting from exoergic reactions between
excited H2 and HOC+, drive the vibrational excitation of H3+. We expect this
photochemistry to be highly active in disks where G0 > 10^3. The H3+ formation
pathways studied here may also be relevant in the inner disk region (near the
host star), in exoplanetary ionospheres, and in the early Universe.

### [23] [Estimating Bolometric Luminosities of Type 1 Quasars with Self-Organizing Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04329)
*Jie Chen,Linhua Jiang,Shengxiu Sun,Zijian Zhang,Mouyuan Sun*

**TL;DR**: 提出了一种基于多波段测光数据计算未遮蔽型1类类星体热光度（bolometric luminosity）的新方法，利用自组织映射神经网络（SOM）减少系统误差，并更新了热光度与单色光度之间的多元线性回归关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 热光度是理解类星体的基本属性，传统方法通常通过单色光度估算，但忽略了类星体光谱能量分布（SED）的多样性。

Data: 使用了SDSS类星体样本（0.5≤z≤2）的多波段观测数据（从紫外到中红外）。

Method: 利用无监督神经网络自组织映射（SOM）描述SED多样性，并通过完全训练的SOM模型计算热光度。

Result: 新方法减少了系统误差，更新了热光度与单色光度（1450Å、3000Å、5100Å）的多元线性回归关系，适用于大样本类星体研究，并已应用于SDSS DR16类星体数据。

Abstract: We present a new method to calculate bolometric luminosities for unobscured,
type 1 quasars with multi-band photometric data. Bolometric luminosity is a
fundamental property to understand quasars and it is commonly estimated from
monochromatic luminosities using bolometric corrections that often neglect
quasar SED diversity. We take advantage of the fact that most quasars now have
multi-band observations from UV to mid-IR, and construct SEDs for a
well-defined sample of SDSS quasars at $0.5\leq z\leq 2$. Based on this
fiducial sample, we explore quasar SEDs, their diversity, and their relations
with bolometric luminosities. We then use unsupervised neural network
self-organizing maps (SOM) to describe the SED diversity and compute the
bolometric luminosities with a fully-trained SOM model. This method reduces
systematical uncertainties compared to the traditional method. In addition, we
update the multi-linear regression relations between bolometric luminosity and
monochromatic luminosities at restframe 1450\r{A}, 3000\r{A}, and 5100\r{A}.
Our method is applicable to large quasar samples with a wide range of
luminosity and redshift. We have applied it to the SDSS DR16 quasars. We have
also made our code publicly available.

**TL;DR**: 该研究提出了一种改进的数值方法，用于模拟球对称自引力系统中自相互作用暗物质的影响，并展示了其在模拟暗物质晕内区初始扁平化和后期引力热塌缩不稳定性中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域关注自相互作用暗物质对球对称自引力系统演化的影响，传统N体模拟方法效率较低，且难以适应不同速度和散射角依赖的截面。

Data: 研究中使用了模拟数据，展示了NFW晕内区的初始扁平化和后期引力热塌缩不稳定性。

Method: 研究采用了一种改进的数值方法，比传统N体模拟更高效，并能轻松适应不同速度和散射角依赖的截面。

Result: 模拟结果显示，NFW晕内区初始扁平化，随后发生引力热塌缩不稳定性，最终在星系中心形成致密核心。该方法还可用于模拟球状星团中的动力学行为。

Abstract: We discuss a modification of a recently developed numerical scheme for
evolving spherically symmetric self-gravitating systems to include the effects
of self-interacting dark matter. The approach is far more efficient than
traditional N-body simulations and cross sections with different dependencies
on velocity and scattering-angle are easily accommodated. To demonstrate, we
provide results of a simulation, which runs quickly on a personal computer,
that shows the expected initial flattening of the inner region of an NFW halo
as well as the later gravothermal collapse instability that leads to a dense
core at the galactic center. We note that this approach can also be used, with
some augmentation, to simulate the dynamics in globular clusters by modeling
gravitational hard scattering as a self-interaction.

**TL;DR**: 研究通过X-GAP样本和Uchuu模拟，建模了X射线和光学波段的选择函数，揭示了X射线通量对选择的主要影响，并校准了速度弥散-晕质量关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 超新星和活动星系核（AGN）的反馈对星系形成和演化有重要影响，但其具体作用尚不明确。星系群因其结合能与中心AGN的能量相当，成为研究这一问题的关键。X-GAP项目通过X射线和光学波段选择了49个星系群样本，为流体动力学模拟提供了基准。

Data: 使用了XMM-Newton Group AGN Project（X-GAP）的49个星系群样本，数据来源于X射线（ROSAT）和光学（SDSS）波段。

Method: 通过Uchuu模拟构建了晕的光锥，利用基于流体动力学模拟训练的神经网络预测X射线星系群性质，并匹配观测到的星系性质。通过正向建模X射线和光学波段的选择过程，比较了所选样本与母体群体。

Result: 研究发现X射线通量是选择的主要驱动因素，速度弥散和红移为次要因素。X-GAP样本的纯度为93%，速度弥散-晕质量关系的标度和斜率与文献一致，内在散射约为0.06 dex。速度弥散测量误差在富系统中为10%，而在成员少于10个的星系群中偏差超过20%。

Abstract: Feedback from supernovae and AGN shapes galaxy formation and evolution, yet
its impact remains unclear. Galaxy groups offer a crucial probe, as their
binding energy is comparable to that available from their central AGN. The
XMM-Newton Group AGN Project (X-GAP) is a sample of 49 groups selected in X-ray
(ROSAT) and optical (SDSS) bands, providing a benchmark for hydrodynamical
simulations. In sight of such a comparison, understanding selection effects is
essential. We aim to model the selection function of X-GAP by forward modelling
the detection process in the X-ray and optical bands. Using the Uchuu
simulation, we build a halo light cone, predict X-ray group properties with a
neural network trained on hydro simulations, and assign galaxies matching
observed properties. We compare the selected sample to the parent population.
Our method provides a sample that matches the observed distribution of X-ray
luminosity and velocity dispersion. The 50% completeness is reached at a
velocity dispersion of 450 km/s in the X-GAP redshift range. The selection is
driven by X-ray flux, with secondary dependence on velocity dispersion and
redshift. We estimate a 93% purity level in the X-GAP parent sample. We
calibrate the velocity dispersion-halo mass relation. We find a normalisation
and slope in agreement with the literature, and an intrinsic scatter of about
0.06 dex. The measured velocity dispersion is accurate within 10% only for rich
systems with more than about 20 members, while the velocity dispersion for
groups with less than 10 members is biased at more than 20%. The X-ray
follow-up refines the optical selection, enhancing purity but reducing
completeness. In an SDSS-like setup, velocity dispersion measurement errors
dominate over intrinsic scatter. Our selection model will enable the
comparisons of thermodynamic properties and gas fractions between X-GAP groups
and hydro simulations.

*Jun-Jie Wei,Fulvio Melia*

**TL;DR**: 利用HII星系和巨型河外HII区作为标准烛光构建哈勃图，支持Rh=ct宇宙模型优于ΛCDM和wCDM模型，但存在未知色散可能影响结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: HII星系和巨型河外HII区被提议作为标准烛光，用于构建高红移哈勃图，以研究宇宙膨胀。当前样本扩展至红移约7.5，覆盖宇宙当前年龄的95%。

Data: 使用了231个HII星系和巨型河外HII区的样本，其中包括JWST新发现的5个HII星系。

Method: 通过模型选择方法，比较Rh=ct宇宙模型与平坦ΛCDM和wCDM模型的相对贝叶斯信息准则概率。

Result: Rh=ct宇宙模型在无未知色散情况下显著优于平坦ΛCDM和wCDM模型，概率分别为91.8%、7.4%和0.8%；但考虑未知色散后，Rh=ct与平坦ΛCDM的似然性相近，且与普朗克优化的物质密度Ωm存在约2.5σ的张力。

Abstract: The proposal to use HII galaxies (HIIGx) and giant extragalactic HII regions
(GEHR) as standard candles to construct the Hubble diagram at redshifts beyond
the current reach of Type Ia supernovae has gained considerable support
recently with the addition of five new HIIGx discovered by JWST. The updated
sample of 231 sources now extends the redshift range of these objects to $z\sim
7.5$, mapping the Universe's expansion over $95\%$ of its current age. In this
{\it Letter} we use these sources for model selection, and show that the
$R_{\rm h}=ct$ universe is strongly favored by this probe over both
flat-$\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM, with relative Bayesian Information Criterion
probabilities of, respectively, $91.8\%$, $7.4\%$ and $0.8\%$. A possible
caveat with these results, however, is that an unknown dispersion, $\sigma_{\rm
int}$, in the HIIGx standard candle relation can weaken the model comparisons.
We find that the inclusion of $\sigma_{\rm int}$ as an additional, optimizable
parameter makes the likelihoods of flat-$\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\rm h}=ct$ about
equal, though at the expense of creating $\sim 2.5\sigma$ tension between our
inferred matter density $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and its {\it Planck}-optimized value.

### [27] [Going Bayesian on the ages of nearby young stellar systems I. The expansion rate method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05110)
*J. Olivares,A. Berihuete,H. Bouy*

**TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种贝叶斯版本的膨胀率方法，用于更准确地估计年轻恒星系统的年龄，并通过模拟验证了其优于传统频率学方法的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 确定年轻恒星系统的年龄对于验证当前恒星形成理论至关重要，但传统频率学方法存在一些缺陷。

Data: 研究使用了模拟数据，这些数据模拟了真实恒星系统的特性，包括年龄在10到40 Myr之间的恒星关联以及距离达400 pc的恒星形成区域。

Method: 研究升级了现有的贝叶斯分层模型，增加了包括系统年龄在内的参数层次，并提出了基于文献的年龄先验分布。

Result: 在10到40 Myr的恒星关联中，误差小于10%；在距离达400 pc的恒星形成区域中，3 Myr时的误差可达80%，但随着年龄增长迅速减小。贝叶斯方法比传统频率学方法更稳健和可靠。

Abstract: Context. Determining the ages of young stellar systems is fundamental to test
and validate current star-formation theories. Aims. We aim at developing a
Bayesian version of the expansion rate method that incorporates the a priori
knowledge on the stellar system's age and solves some of the caveats of the
traditional frequentist approach. Methods. We upgrade an existing Bayesian
hierarchical model with additional parameter hierarchies that include, amongst
others, the system's age. For this later, we propose prior distributions
inspired by literature works. Results. We validate our method on a set of
extensive simulations mimicking the properties of real stellar systems. In
stellar associations between 10 and 40 Myr and up to 150 pc the errors are
<10%. In star forming regions up to 400 pc, the error can be as large as 80% at
3 Myr but it rapidly decreases with increasing age. Conclusions. The Bayesian
expansion rate methodology that we present here offers several advantages over
the traditional frequentist version. In particular, the Bayesian age estimator
is more robust and credible than the commonly used the frequentist ones. This
new Bayesian expansion rate method is made publicly available as a module of
the free and open-source code Kalkayotl.

**TL;DR**: 本文通过膨胀率测年技术确定了局部年轻恒星协会（LYSAs）的年龄，并发现了文献中隐藏的四个新协会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 局部年轻恒星协会（LYSAs）是测试恒星形成理论预测的重要实验室，但如何通过最小偏差的测年技术估计其年龄至关重要。

Data: 使用了文献中的成员列表、公开可用的天体测量数据和径向速度数据。

Method: 采用了一种开源贝叶斯代码实现膨胀率测年技术，结合简单的统计假设，以去污染、识别可能的子结构或种群，并估计膨胀年龄。

Result: 得出了最大且方法学上最均匀的LYSAs年龄集合，并重新发现了三个协会，同时发现了文献中隐藏的四个新协会。

Abstract: Context. Local young stellar associations (LYSAs <50 Myr and <150 pc) are
important laboratories to test predictions from star-formation theories.
Estimating their ages through various dating techniques with minimal biases is
thus of paramount importance. Aims. We aim at determining the ages of LYSAs
with the expansion rate dating technique. Methods. We estimate the ages of the
LYSAs using literature membership lists, publicly available data (astrometry
and radial velocities), and a recent open-source Bayesian code that implements
the expansion rate method. This code in combination with simple statistical
assumptions allow us to decontaminate, identify possible substructures or
populations, and estimate expansion ages. Results. We derive the largest and
most methodological homogeneous set of ages of LYSAs. We rediscover three and
discover four associations hidden within the literature membership lists of the
classical ones. Conclusions. The expansion ages we report here are compatible
with literature age estimates. Moreover, our analysis shows that previous age
tensions can be explained, in most cases, by the presence of unidentified
populations or substructures.

*Haitian Shang,Wei Zhao,Xiaoyu Hong,Xu-zhi Hu*

**TL;DR**: 通过多时期图像叠加和分析射流宽度与距离的关系，研究发现0241+622源的射流在核心附近呈抛物线形状，并在远离核心后转为圆锥形，射流动力学和准直特性受周围介质条件显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前对射流结构和动力学的研究主要集中在射流形状和速度场的分析上，但对其与周围介质相互作用的了解仍有限。0241+622源的射流结构研究有助于揭示射流加速和准直过程及其与环境的关系。

Data: 使用了VLBA在1.6 GHz至43 GHz频率范围内的五对数据，以及多时期叠加的图像数据。

Method: 通过图像叠加技术恢复射流横截面，分析射流宽度与距离的关系，并利用核心位移和适当运动分析估计射流与视线夹角。

Result: 研究发现射流在核心附近呈抛物线形状（0.12至6.1 mas），之后转为圆锥形；射流在3.14 mas内呈现加速运动，6.1 mas处宽度减小可能与Bondi半径相关，表明射流动力学受周围介质条件影响。

Abstract: We conducted a detailed analysis of the jet structure and dynamics of the
source 0241+622 on milliarcsecond (mas) scales. We stacked images from multiple
epochs to better recover the crosssection of the jet. By analyzing the
relationship between jet width and distance, we observed that the jet exhibits
a parabolic shape from the core, spanning a region from 0.12 to 6.1 mas. This
structure suggests the acceleration and collimation processes of the jet.
Beyond 18 mas from the core, the jet adopts a conical shape, and the expansion
speed of the jet becomes faster within the range from 4500 to 6500 mas. We
obtained the core shift of this source using five pairs of data from VLBA at
1.6 GHz to 43 GHz. Based on previous studies, through proper motion analysis of
the jet components, we estimated the angle between the jet and the line of
sight to be approximately 65.7{\deg}, so 1 mas corresponds to 0.95 pc
(de-projected distance). We then obtained the velocity field of the source
within 3.14 mas from the central black hole and found that the jet exhibits
accelerated motion within this range. At approximately 6.1 mas from the core,
we observed that the jet width begins to decrease, which we identified as
possibly corresponding to the Bondi radius of this source. The reduction in jet
width may be related to changes in the external environmental pressure,
particularly within the Bondi radius, indicating that the jet dynamics and
collimation characteristics are strongly influenced by the surrounding medium
conditions.

**TL;DR**: 本研究通过将暗物质建模为具有特定状态方程的完美流体，推导出包含暗物质贡献的“指数”度量，并计算其关键特征，揭示了与Schwarzschild度量的显著偏差，为暗物质在星系动力学中的作用提供了理论框架。

Background: 天体物理观测提供了暗物质存在的有力证据，暗物质是一种非发光成分，主导了宇宙的质量-能量预算。虽然暗物质的引力影响在星系尺度上已得到充分证实，但其精确性质和对时空几何的影响仍是未解之谜。

Method: 研究将暗物质建模为具有特定状态方程的完美流体，推导出包含暗物质贡献的“指数”度量，并计算其关键特征（事件视界、最内稳定圆轨道和光子球）。

Result: 研究结果表明，与Schwarzschild度量的预测相比，暗物质分布会导致显著的偏差。此外，从指数度量导出的轨道速度剖面能够解释观测到的星系平坦旋转曲线，强调了在描述大质量物体附近时空时考虑修正度量的重要性。

Abstract: Astrophysical observations provide compelling evidence for the existence of
dark matter, a non-luminous component dominating the universe's mass-energy
budget. Its gravitational influence is well-established on galactic scales;
however, dark matter's precise nature and effect on spacetime geometry remain
open questions. This study investigates modifications to the Schwarzschild
metric due to the presence of dark matter, modeled as a perfect fluid with a
specific equation of state. We derive an "exponential" metric incorporating
this dark matter contribution and calculate its key characteristics: the event
horizon, innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), and photon sphere. Comparing
these with Schwarzschild predictions reveals distinct deviations dependent on
the dark matter distribution. Furthermore, we analyze the orbital velocity
profiles derived from the exponential metric, demonstrating its potential to
explain the observed flat rotation curves of galaxies. Our results underscore
the importance of considering modified metrics in accurately describing
spacetime near massive objects and provide a theoretical framework for further
investigations into dark matter's role in galactic dynamics.
