**TL;DR**: 该研究通过模拟和观测对比，探讨了高速云（HVCs）在穿过银河系热晕时的生存条件，发现湍流辐射混合层（TRML）对HVCs的冷却和生长至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 高速云（HVCs）可能为银河系未来的恒星形成提供燃料，但它们需要先穿过银河系的热晕。尽管近期研究对云-风相互作用的生存条件有了更深入的理解，但缺乏观测数据验证这一条件。

Data: 研究使用了GALFA-HI巡天数据对史密斯云（Smith Cloud）进行观测，并基于其观测特性在Enzo-E磁流体动力学代码中进行了风洞模拟。

Method: 通过生成矩图、利用一阶速度结构函数（VSF）表征湍流，以及使用归一化自协方差函数分析HI柱密度，对比了观测和模拟结果。

Result: 研究发现，某些模拟能够复现关键观测特征（如柱密度与速度弥散的相关性），但无法同时匹配所有观测指标；湍流辐射混合层（TRML）对HVCs的冷却和生长具有重要作用。

Abstract: High-velocity clouds (HVCs) may fuel future star formation in the Milky Way,
but they must first survive their passage through the hot halo. While recent
work has improved our understanding of the survival criterion for cloud-wind
interactions, few observational comparisons exist that test this criterion. We
therefore present an initial comparison of simulations with the Smith Cloud
(SC; $d=$ 12.4 kpc, $l, b = 40^{\circ}, -13^{\circ}$) as mapped with the
GALFA-HI survey. We use the Smith Cloud's observed properties to motivate
simulations of comparable clouds in wind tunnel simulations with Enzo-E, an MHD
code. For both observations and simulations, we generate moment maps,
characterize turbulence through a projected first-order velocity structure
function (VSF), and do the same for HI column density with a normalized
autocovariance function. We explore how initial cloud conditions (such as
radius, metallicity, thermal pressure, viewing angle, and distance) affect
these statistics, demonstrating that the small-scale VSF is sensitive to cloud
turbulence while large scales depend on cloud bulk velocity and viewing angle.
We find that some simulations reproduce key observational features
(particularly the correlation between column density and velocity dispersion)
but none match all observational probes at the same time (the large scales of
the column density autocovariance is particularly challenging). We find that
the simulated cloud (cloud C) showing growth via a turbulent radiative mixing
layer (TRML) is the best match, implying the importance of TRML-mediated
cooling for Milky Way HVCs. We conclude by suggesting improvements for
simulations to better match observed HVCs.

*Juan P. Farias,Stella S. R. Offner,Ronan Kerr,Michael Y. Grudić*

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过分析STARFORGE模拟数据，探讨了观测偏差对恒星群质量、大小和速度弥散度测量的影响，并比较了模拟结果与Cepheus Far North区域的观测数据，质疑了运动学回溯方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 最近的研究表明，银河系中大多数恒星形成区域形成的是恒星关联而非束缚星团。然而，观测偏差（如随机虚假测量、未解析的双星和光度灵敏度）对这些恒星群的测量引入了显著的不确定性。

Data: 使用了STARFORGE模拟套件中的模型数据，并与Cepheus Far North (CFN)区域的观测数据进行了比较。

Method: 通过引入观测偏差（如随机虚假测量、未解析的双星和光度灵敏度）创建合成观测数据，并分析了这些偏差对恒星群质量、大小和速度弥散度测量的影响。此外，还评估了运动学回溯方法的准确性。

Result: 研究发现观测偏差对恒星群质量、大小和速度弥散度的测量引入了高达100%的不确定性，且运动学回溯方法仅在特定情况下准确。此外，恒星在母云消散过程中持续形成，导致恒星动力学年龄差异与嵌入阶段长度之间无关联。

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that most star-forming regions in our Galaxy form
stellar associations rather than bound clusters. We analyse models from the
STARFORGE simulation suite, a set of magneto-hydrodynamical simulations that
include all key stellar feedback and radiative processes following star
formation through cloud dispersal. We create synthetic observations by
introducing observational biases such as random spurious measurements,
unresolved binaries, and photometric sensitivity. These biases affect the
measurement of the group mass, size, and velocity dispersion, introducing
uncertainties of up to 100%, with accuracy improving as the number of system
members increases. Furthermore, models favouring the formation of groups around
massive stars were the most affected by observational biases, as massive stars
contribute a larger fraction of the group mass and are often missing from
astrometric surveys like Gaia. We compare the simulations to the Cepheus Far
North (CFN) region, and show that CFN groups may have formed in a low-density
environment similar to those modelled in STARFORGE but with massive stars not
located preferentially in groups. We also question the effectiveness of the
kinematic traceback method, showing that it is accurate within 20% only for
certain associations with actual virial parameters above 2. However,
observational biases can artificially raise the virial parameter by up to a
factor ten, making it difficult to evaluate the reliability of the traceback
age. Additionally, since stars continue to form during the dispersal of the
parent cloud, we find no relation between the stellar-dynamical age difference
and the length of the embedded phase.

**TL;DR**: 南极点望远镜第三代相机（SPT-3G）观测了与欧几里得宽视场巡天重叠的10,000平方度天区，并发布了与欧几里得深场南（EDF-S）重叠的57平方度区域的毫米波数据，包括温度图和两个源表。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 欧几里得合作组近期发布了第一快速数据发布（Q1）中的欧几里得深场观测数据。为了提供互补的毫米波数据并促进遗产科学研究，研究团队对与欧几里得深场南（EDF-S）重叠的57平方度区域进行了专门观测。

Data: 观测数据覆盖了95、150和220 GHz（波长分别为3.3、2.0和1.4毫米）三个频段，噪声深度分别为4.3、3.8和13.2微K-弧分。

Method: 观测时间为20天，研究团队构建了温度图和两个源表：一个包含601个发射源的源表（其中334个位于EDF-S内），另一个包含217个星系团候选（其中121个位于EDF-S内）。

Result: 发射源表中54%为同步辐射主导源，46%为热尘埃发射主导源，5σ检测阈值分别为1.7、2.0和6.5 mJy。星系团候选的中位质量为2.12×10^14太阳质量/h70，中位红移为0.70，密度比该区域之前的tSZ选择星系团表提高了约一个数量级（每平方度3.81个星系团）。

Abstract: Context. The South Pole Telescope third-generation camera (SPT-3G) has
observed over 10,000 square degrees of sky at 95, 150, and 220 GHz (3.3, 2.0,
1.4 mm, respectively) overlapping the ongoing 14,000 square-degree Euclid Wide
Survey. The Euclid collaboration recently released Euclid Deep Field
observations in the first quick data release (Q1). Aims. With the goal of
releasing complementary millimeter-wave data and encouraging legacy science, we
performed dedicated observations of a 57-square-degree field overlapping the
Euclid Deep Field South (EDF-S). Methods. The observing time totaled 20 days
and we reached noise depths of 4.3, 3.8, and 13.2 $\mu$K-arcmin at 95, 150, and
220 GHz, respectively. Results. In this work we present the temperature maps
and two catalogs constructed from these data. The emissive source catalog
contains 601 objects (334 inside EDF-S) with 54% synchrotron-dominated sources
and 46% thermal dust emission-dominated sources. The 5$\sigma$ detection
thresholds are 1.7, 2.0, and 6.5 mJy in the three bands. The cluster catalog
contains 217 cluster candidates (121 inside EDF-S) with median mass
$M_{500c}=2.12 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}/h_{70}$ and median redshift $z$ = 0.70,
corresponding to an order-of-magnitude improvement in cluster density over
previous tSZ-selected catalogs in this region (3.81 clusters per square
degree). Conclusions. The overlap between SPT and Euclid data will enable a
range of multiwavelength studies of the aforementioned source populations. This
work serves as the first step towards joint projects between SPT and Euclid and
provides a rich dataset containing information on galaxies, clusters, and their
environments.

### [4] [The origin of the metallicity difference between star-forming and passive galaxies: Insights from ν2GC semi-analytic model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00378)
*Qiansheng Liu,Takashi Okamoto,Taira Oogi,Masahiro Nagashima*

**TL;DR**: The study uses the nu2GC semi-analytic model to identify strangulation as the primary driver of metallicity differences between star-forming and passive galaxies, emphasizing the role of star formation timescales and proposing insights for refining gas halo growth models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The research addresses the observed metallicity difference between star-forming and passive galaxies, a phenomenon not fully explained by current models, and aims to understand its origin using the nu2GC semi-analytic galaxy formation model.

Data: The study utilizes the nu2GC semi-analytic galaxy formation model and observational data of local galaxies, including their metallicity differences and potential-metallicity relations.

Method: The research employs the nu2GC semi-analytic galaxy formation model, varying star formation efficiency to investigate the metallicity differences and identify strangulation as the primary mechanism.

Result: The findings indicate that strangulation is the main driver of metallicity differences, with quenched galaxies exhibiting higher metallicities than star-forming ones of the same mass, particularly in isolated, low-mass galaxies where rapid cooling mimics strangulation.

Abstract: We investigate the origin of the observed metallicity difference between
star-forming and passive galaxies using the semi-analytic galaxy formation
model nu2GC. Our fiducial model successfully reproduces the observed
metallicity differences in local galaxies while simultaneously matching the
potential-metallicity relations of both star-forming and passive galaxies. By
varying the star formation efficiency, we identify strangulation as the primary
driver of the metallicity difference. This finding highlights the critical role
of star formation timescales in explaining the observed metallicity difference.
Our results suggest that metallicity differences serve as a valuable diagnostic
for evaluating star formation models in both semi-analytic models and
cosmological simulations. Furthermore, galaxies quenched by processes
resembling strangulation -- where the supply of cold gas is halted in a slowly
growing halo -- exhibit higher metallicities than star-forming galaxies of the
same stellar mass. In our model, this occurs in isolated, low-mass galaxies
where rapid cooling leads to an effect resembling strangulation due to the
discrete treatment of gas accretion onto dark matter halos. We propose that the
metallicities of isolated, low-mass passive galaxies could provide key insights
into refining models of hot gas halo growth.

### [5] [Evidence of Gaia Enceladus experiencing at least two passages around the Milky Way](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00409)
*Ása Skúladóttir,Heitor Ernandes,Diane K. Feuillet,Alice Mori,Sofia Feltzing,Romain E. R. Lucchesi,Paola Di Matteo*

**TL;DR**: 研究发现银河系在约100亿年前与Gaia Enceladus星系多次碰撞的证据，通过化学和动力学特征区分了不同时期的恒星群体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 银河系历史上最后一次重大合并事件是与Gaia Enceladus星系的碰撞，模拟预测该星系会多次穿过银河系盘面，但此前缺乏观测证据。

Data: 使用了高精度化学丰度数据，包括新的铝测量数据，以及恒星的运动学能量信息。

Method: 通过分析恒星的化学丰度（如[Fe/H]、[Al/Fe]、[Mg/Fe]和[Mg/Ba]）和动力学特征，区分了来自Gaia Enceladus不同区域的恒星群体。

Result: 研究发现高能量恒星来自Gaia Enceladus外围区域，低能量恒星来自内部区域，证实了该星系多次穿过银河系盘面后才完全合并。

Abstract: One of the major recent breakthroughs has been the discovery of the last
Major Merger to happen in the history of the Milky Way. Around 10 Gyr ago the
galaxy Gaia Enceladus, with estimated ~10% of the Milky Way mass, fell into its
potential, bringing a large amount of stars which can be identified through
their unique chemical and kinematic signatures. Simulations have long predicted
that a galaxy of this size should experience several passages through the disk
of the Milky Way before eventually being fully dispersed. For the first time,
we present observational evidence to support this. We identify two
subpopulations accreted from Gaia Enceladus: 1) stars which today have large
kinematic energy, which originate from the outskirts of Gaia Enceladus and were
accreted during early passages; 2) stars with low kinetic energy accreted at
later passages, originating from the inner parts of Gaia Enceladus. Through the
use of high-precision chemical abundances, crucially including new aluminum
measurements, we show that in all observed abundance ratios ([Fe/H], [Al/Fe],
[Mg/Fe] and [Mg/Ba]), stars with high energy show evidence of coming from a
less chemically evolved outer region of Gaia Enceladus, compared to the stars
with low energy. We therefore conclude that Gaia Enceladus experienced several
passages before merging with the main body of our Galaxy. This discovery has
wide implications for our understanding of this event, and consolidates Gaia
Enceladus as a benchmark for studying galaxy mergers and hierarchical galaxy
formation in extraordinary details.

Result: PRISMA成功恢复了模拟星系局部区域的恒星形成率和气体相金属丰度的内在值，并提出了基于模拟结果的金属丰度示踪剂的新校准。

Abstract: Hydrodynamic simulations are powerful tools for studying galaxy formation.
However, it is crucial to test and improve the sub-grid physics underlying
these simulations by comparing their predictions with observations. To this
aim, observable quantities can be derived for simulated galaxies, enabling the
analysis of simulated properties through an observational approach. Our goal is
to develop a new numerical tool capable of generating synthetic emission line
spectra from spatially resolved regions in simulated galaxies, mocking Integral
Field Unit (IFU) observations. Synthetic spectra of simulated galaxies are
produced by integrating the software CIGALE with the outcomes of hydrodynamical
simulations. We consider contributions of both stellar populations and nebular
emission. The nebular emission lines in the spectra are modeled by considering
only the contributions from the simulated star-forming regions. Our model
considers the properties of the surrounding interstellar medium to estimate the
ionizing parameters, the metallicity, the velocity dispersion and the electron
density. We present the new numerical tool PRISMA. Leveraging synthetic spectra
generated by our model, PRISMA successfully computed and recovered the
intrinsic values of the star formation rate and gas-phase metallicity in local
regions of simulated galaxies. Additionally, we examine the behavior of
metallicity tracers such as N2, R23, O3N2, N2O2, recovered by PRISMA and
propose new calibrations based on our simulated result. These findings show the
robustness of our tool in recovering the intrinsic properties of simulated
galaxies through their synthetic spectra, thereby becoming a powerful tool to
confront simulations and observational data.

**TL;DR**: 通过SDSS-V第19次数据发布的394,000颗恒星丰度数据，研究团队利用双吸积模型模拟了银河系的化学演化，揭示了薄盘和厚盘的化学分离及其形成时间尺度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 银河系的化学演化研究是理解其形成历史的关键，但目前对薄盘和厚盘的化学分离及其形成机制仍存在争议。本研究利用高精度恒星丰度数据，旨在揭示银河系盘的形成过程和时间尺度。

Data: 使用了SDSS-V第19次数据发布的394,000颗恒星丰度数据，特别是[Mg/M]比值来区分薄盘和厚盘。

Method: 采用了双吸积模型（two-infall GCE models），结合化学演化环境OMEGA+、Levenberg-Marquardt算法和自助法（bootstrapping）进行模拟和分析。

Result: 研究发现薄盘和厚盘通过Mg观测分离，其他α元素表现出相似趋势，而奇数Z元素则显示不同的金属丰度模式。模型确认了约100亿年前的合并事件，并支持银河系盘由内向外形成的假说。

Abstract: We obtain two-infall galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models simulating the
chemical evolution of the Milky Way as constrained by a golden sample of
$394,000$ stellar abundances of the Milky Way Mapper survey from the 19th data
release of SDSS-V. The separation between the chemical thin and thick disks is
defined using [Mg/M]. We use the chemical evolution environment
$\texttt{OMEGA+}$, combined with Levenberg-Marquardt and bootstrapping. We
simulate the entire Galactic disk and six galactocentric regions for a more
detailed analysis of the formation of the inner, middle, and outer Galaxy. We
investigate the evolution of $\alpha$, odd-Z, and iron-peak elements: 15
species altogether. The chemical thin and thick disks are separated by Mg
observations, which the other $\alpha$-elements show similar trends with, while
odd-Z species demonstrate different patterns as functions of metallicity. In
the inward Galactic disk regions the locus of the low-Mg sequence is gradually
shifted toward higher metallicity, while the high-Mg phase is less populated.
The best-fit GCE models show a well-defined peak in the rate of the infalling
matter as a function of the Galactic age, confirming a merger event about $10$
Gyr ago. We show that the timescale of gas accretion, the time of the second
infall as well as the ratio between the surface mass densities associated to
the second infall and the formation event vary with the distance from the
Galactic center. The disk is assembled within a timescale of
$(0.32\pm0.02)~$Gyr during a primary formation phase, then a
$(0.55\pm0.06)~$Gyr-timescale, increasing accretion rate was followed by a
relaxation that lasted $(2.86\pm0.70)~$Gyr, with a second peak of the infall
rate at $(4.13\pm0.19)~$Gyr. Our best Galaxy evolution models are consistent
with an inside-out formation scenario of the Milky Way disk, in agreement with
recent chemo-dynamical simulations.

Background: 星系棒在弯曲阶段的共振结构研究尚不充分，特别是利用作用-角变量分析轨道行为及其对相空间的影响。

Data: 研究中使用了N体星系棒模型中的所有轨道数据。

Method: 通过作用-角变量分析轨道行为，将轨道分为不同类型（如振动或循环），并研究其与固定点的关系。

Result: 研究发现弯曲阶段轨道类型发生转变（如共振捕获或共振加热），伴随垂直作用增加和相空间不对称性的形成与恢复。

Abstract: For the first time, we investigate the resonant structure of $N$-body
galactic bar at the stage of buckling using action-angle variables. We studied
the evolution of vertical actions ($J_z$) and angles associated with vertical
resonance ($\theta_\mathrm{res}=\theta_z - \theta_R$) for all orbits in the
bar. For this purpose, we divide the orbits into types according to the
behavior (libration or circulation) of their resonant angle with respect to
fixed points $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$ and $\pi$ (vertical resonance). We show
that during buckling, flat bar orbits circulating with increasing
$\theta_\mathrm{res}$ transformed into banana-shaped librating orbits (resonant
capture) or circulating orbits with decreasing $\theta_\mathrm{res}$ (resonant
heating). The orbital transformation is accompanied by an increase in $J_z$ and
the formation of a boxy/peanut-shaped (B/PS) bulge. During buckling, the phase
space $J_z - \theta_\mathrm{res}$ undergoes a distortion creating an asymmetry
in the position of the fixed points $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$ and $\pi$ and in
banana-shaped orbits near these points. The fixed point $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$
may disappear completely. This also breaks the symmetry between the orbits,
which are captured into resonance or go into circulation with decreasing
$\theta_\mathrm{res}$ near $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$ and $\pi$. At the same time,
near $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$, banana-shaped orbits with low vertical action
$J_z$ appear. This reopens the path of orbital transformation through the fixed
point $\theta_\mathrm{res}=0$. The phase space transformation and orbit
transformation occur in a coordinated manner and lead to smoothing of phase
space perturbations and restoration of symmetry between orbits.

**TL;DR**: 通过近红外光谱分析X射线星系团XCS2215中的23个成员星系，研究发现星系团核心区域的金属丰度高于场星系，且气体外流较弱，表明星系团环境影响了气体吸积和化学演化。

Background: 研究背景是探讨星系团环境对气体流动和金属丰度的影响，特别是与场星系的对比，以理解星系团核心区域的气体吸积模式和化学演化过程。

Data: 使用Keck/MOSFIRE对X射线星系团XCS2215（红移z=1.46）中的23个成员星系进行了近红外光谱观测，并结合ALMA数据构建了金属丰度与气体质量分数的关系图。

Method: 通过分析Hα和[N II]发射线的金属丰度，并与场星系对比，同时结合化学演化模型估计质量加载因子，研究了星系团环境对气体流动和金属丰度的影响。

Result: 研究发现星系团核心区域的金属丰度比场星系高0.08-0.15 dex，且气体外流较弱，表明星系团环境通过限制气体流动和促进气体循环影响了化学演化。

Abstract: We present the result of near-infrared spectroscopy using Keck/MOSFIRE for 23
member galaxies in an X-ray cluster XCS2215 ($z=1.46$) to investigate the
environmental dependence of gaseous flows and metallicities. We find that the
metallicities derived from H$\alpha$ and [N II] emission lines of the cluster
galaxies are enhanced by 0.08-0.15 dex with $\sim$2 $\sigma$ significance
compared to field counterparts for the same stellar mass. It suggests that
inefficient gas accretion in the shock-heated intracluster medium (ICM) in the
cluster core results in the lack of metallicity dilution. We also estimate the
mass-loading factor by comparing the observed galaxies with the chemical
evolution model that takes into account the outflow processes on the
metallicity versus gas mass fraction diagram constructed together with the ALMA
data. We find that the outflows from galaxies in the cluster core region tend
to be weaker than those of galaxies in the general field. It is likely due to
the confinement of gas by the high pressure of the surrounding ICM in the
cluster core, which leads to the recycling of the outflowing gas that comes
back to the system and is used for further star formation, resulting in the
progression of chemical evolution. Compared with higher redshift protocluster
galaxies at $z>2$, which tend to show lower metallicity than the field galaxies
due probably to dilution of metals by pristine gas inflow, we are seeing the
transition of gas accretion mode from efficient cold stream mode to the
inefficient hot mode.

Background: 许多研究认为，没有重子对应物且具有内尖峰的暗物质子晕无论经历多强的潮汐力都能存活。然而，这些研究并未全面考察子晕结构参数在潮汐作用下的演化。

Data: 使用改进版的DASH代码模拟了单个暗物质子晕在银河系大小晕中的轨道演化，考虑了银河系随时间变化的引力势。

Method: 通过数值模拟分析了低质量暗物质子晕的V_max、r_max和浓度在潮汐剥离作用下的演化，考察了初始浓度、轨道参数和内斜率的影响。

Result: 研究发现r_max比V_max收缩得更快，导致子晕浓度随时间持续上升；当前速度浓度比初始高约两个数量级，且近心点潮汐轨迹的浓度更高。

Abstract: Many studies assert that dark matter (DM) subhaloes without a baryonic
counterpart and with an inner cusp always survive no matter the strength of the
tidal force they undergo. In this work, we perform a suite of numerical
simulations specifically designed to analyse the evolution of $V_\mathrm{max}$,
$r_\mathrm{max}$ and concentration of low-mass DM subhaloes due to tidal
stripping. We employ the improved version of the DASH code, introduced in our
previous work arXiv:2207.08652 to investigate subhalo survival. We follow the
tidal evolution of a single DM subhalo orbiting a Milky Way (MW)-size halo
modeled with a baryonic disc and a bulge replicating the actual mass
distribution of the MW. We consider the effect of the time-evolving
gravitational potential of the MW itself. We simulate subhaloes with
unprecedented accuracy, varying their initial concentration, orbital
parameters, and inner slope (both NFW and prompt cusps are considered). Unlike
the previous literature, we examine the evolution of subhalo structural
parameters -- tidal tracks -- not only at orbit apocentres but also at
pericentres, finding in the former case both similarities and differences --
particularly pronounced in the case of prompt cusps. Overall, $r_\mathrm{max}$
shrinks more than $V_\mathrm{max}$, leading to a continuous rise of subhalo
concentration with time. The velocity concentration at present is found to be
around two orders of magnitude higher than the one at infall, being
comparatively larger for pericentre tidal tracks versus apocentres. These
findings highlight the dominant role of tidal effects in reshaping low-mass DM
subhaloes, providing valuable insights for future research via simulations and
observations, such as correctly interpreting data from galaxy satellite
populations, subhalo searches with gravitational lensing or stellar stream
analyses, and indirect DM searches.

**TL;DR**: 本文通过模拟宽线区（BLR）中云团的分布和动力学，研究了活动星系核（AGN）光谱线轮廓的通用形状及其与黑洞质量、视角和吸积率的关系，并发现峰值时间延迟更能代表半径-光度关系的观测趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 活动星系核（AGN）的宽发射线是其关键光谱特征，其轮廓形状依赖于宽线区（BLR）中离散云团的复杂动力学。BLR的几何结构直接影响时间延迟的测量，但目前对云团分布和动力学的研究仍需深入。

Result: 研究发现，光谱线轮廓的宽度随黑洞质量或视角增加而变宽，随吸积率增加而变窄；蓝翼随黑洞质量和吸积率增加而增强，表明存在外流结构；峰值时间延迟比平均延迟更能代表半径-光度关系的观测趋势和散射。

Abstract: Galaxies with active galactic nuclei (AGN) exhibit broad emission lines as a
key spectral feature. The shape of emission-line profiles depends on the
complex dynamics of discrete clouds within a spatially extended region known as
the Broad Line Region (BLR). The distribution of cloud positions within BLR, or
the geometry of BLR indeed, is directly linked to measurements of time lags of
BLR. In this paper, we convolve a large grid of physically-based simulations of
cloud distributions in BLR with photon-flux weighted emissivity of BLR clouds
to investigate the generic shape of spectral line profiles. More importantly,
we extract the time-delay histograms of corresponding models to calculate the
size of BLR. Our physical model is based on the assumption that the clouds are
launched by the radiation pressure acting on dust in the atmosphere of the
outer disk. It has very few global parameters. The model is appropriate for the
low ionization part of the BLR, as it was shown by earlier model tests. It uses
a non-hydrodynamical single-cloud approach to the BLR dynamics. In this way we
simulate the distribution of positions and velocities of the clouds. We found
that the width of line profiles gets broader with black hole mass, or with
viewing angle, and gets narrower with accretion rate. The blue wing of the
emission line profiles becomes more pronounced with increasing black hole mass
and accretion rate, consistent with the formation and intensification of an
outflow structure. We also found that the peak time-delays rather than averaged
delay values better represents the observational trend and also the scatter in
the radius-luminosity relation.

**TL;DR**: 本文通过理论模型研究了金属丰度对经典造父变星多波段周期-光度关系的影响，发现金属丰度对紫外波段影响最大，光学波段次之，而红外波段影响渐趋零。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 金属丰度对造父变星多波段周期-光度关系的影响是研究宇宙膨胀率的关键因素之一，但此前研究未发现统计显著的结果。

Data: 使用了覆盖经典造父变星表面重力和温度范围的理论恒星大气模型的光谱能量分布数据。

Method: 通过分析理论恒星大气模型，研究了金属丰度从低于太阳值2 dex到高于太阳值0.5 dex范围内对多波段周期-光度关系的系统性影响。

Result: 研究发现金属丰度对紫外波段影响最大，光学波段次之，而红外波段影响渐趋零，但这些影响较小，与之前的研究结果一致。

Abstract: This is the second of two papers exploring the effects of metallicity on the
multi-wavelength properties of Cepheids in terms of their multi-wavelength
period-luminosity (PL) relations, impacting their use as extragalactic distance
indicators, underpinning one of the most popular paths to estimating of the
expansion rate of the Universe, Ho. In Paper I (Madore & Freedman 2024) we
presented five tests for the influence of metallicity on galactic and
extragalactic Cepheid PL relations, spanning nearly 2 dex in metallicity, and
inspecting PL relations from the optical (BVI), through the near-infrared (JHK)
and into mid-infrared (at 3.4 and 4.5 microns). And,in no case were any
statistically significant results forthcoming. Here we interrogate published
spectral energy distributions constructed from theoretical (static) stellar
atmospheres, cov- ering the surface gravity and temperature ranges attributed
to classical (supergiant, F and K spectral type) Cepheid variables, and explore
the differential effects of changing the atmospheric metallicity, down by 2 dex
from solar (a factor of 100 below the average Milky Way value) and then up from
solar by 0.5 dex (i.e., factor of 3x above the Milky Way value). The
theoretical models clearly show that metallicity systematically impacts each of
the bandpasses differentially: the level of this effect is largest in the
ultraviolet (where line blanketing is most intense), reversing sign in the
optical (due to flux redistribution from the UV), and then asymptotically
falling back to zero from the red to the far infrared. The discovered effects
of metallicity are systematic, but they are small; and as such they do not
contradict the findings of Paper I, but they do explain why the problem has
been so hard to resolve given the low level of precision of the photometry for
all but the very nearest and apparently brightest Cepheids.

**TL;DR**: 本文研究了11颗高光度热尘埃遮蔽星系（Hot DOGs）的黑洞质量与恒星质量关系，发现其爱丁顿比率较高，且与本地关系无显著差异，表明这些星系可能是大质量早型星系的前身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 热尘埃遮蔽星系（Hot DOGs）是由广域红外巡天探测器（WISE）全天巡天发现的一类罕见的超光度尘埃遮蔽类星体。其核周尘埃的强烈遮蔽使得只有少量散射光能够逃逸，从而可以将恒星成分从总流量中分解出来。散射光的存在使得可以通过SDSS及相关文献获取源的红移和黑洞性质。

Data: 研究使用了WISE和SDSS的数据，选择了11颗红移在1.5到3.7之间、光度大于10^47 erg/s的高光度Hot DOGs。

Method: 通过贝叶斯光谱能量分布（SED）拟合或结合哈勃太空望远镜（HST）图像分解的额外约束，研究了这些源的黑洞质量与恒星质量关系。

Result: 成功测定了8颗Hot DOGs的恒星质量，发现其爱丁顿比率较高（中位数为1.05，最大值接近3），且与本地关系无显著差异，表明这些尘埃遮蔽类星体可能是大质量早型星系的前身，其后续演化可能受活动星系核反馈的显著影响。

Abstract: Hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a rare population of hyperluminous
dust-obscured quasars discovered by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
(WISE) all-sky survey. The heavy circumnuclear dust obscuration allows only a
small amount of scattered light from the obscured quasar to escape, enabling
the decomposition of the stellar component from the total flux. The presence of
scattered light enables the redshift of the source and the properties of the
black hole to be obtained from SDSS and SDSS-related literature. From WISE and
SDSS data, we select 11 hyperluminous Hot DOGs at $z=1.5-3.7$ with bolometric
luminosities $L_{\rm bol} \gtrsim 10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg \ s^{-1}}$. We
investigate the $M_{\rm BH}-M_\star$ relation in these sources using Bayesian
spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting or with extra constraints from
\textit{Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) image decomposition. Stellar masses are
successfully derived for eight Hot DOGs. We find high Eddington ratios
$\lambda_{\rm Edd}$ in these Hot DOGs, with the median value of 1.05 and the
maximum value close to 3. The super-Eddington accretion may be associated with
the overdense environments of Hot DOGs. We find no significant differences in
the $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ of these Hot DOGs compared to the local relation,
suggesting that these dust-obscured quasars are the progenitors of massive
early-type galaxies. We speculate that the subsequent evolution of Hot DOGs may
be significantly influenced by AGN feedback and remain on the local relation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 暗物质由超轻粒子的玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚体（BEC）组成，其孤子形状在星系中随暗物质质量分数的变化而变化，尤其是在中心存在恒星质量（如黑洞）的星系中。目前的研究表明，在自引力暗物质极限下，孤子的核心形状与数值预测和解析近似一致。

Data: 研究使用了矮球状星系（dSph）和超暗弱矮星系（UFD）的观测数据。

Method: 通过求解薛定谔-泊松方程，并将基态波函数表示为高斯函数的数值优化振幅和宽度的组合，得到了孤子的形状。

Result: 研究发现，随着暗物质质量分数的减少，孤子形状逐渐变为尖峰状，密度分布接近指数形式（类似于氢原子的1s态），且中心斜率与冷暗物质模拟的预测一致。研究还探讨了暗物质蒸发在星系演化中的可能作用，并提出了暗物质孤子可能是光子凝聚体的假设。

Abstract: Dark matter consisting of a Bose-Einstein-Condensate (BEC) of ultra-light
particles is predicted to have a soliton shape that shifts with the dark matter
mass fraction in galaxies with a centrally localized stellar mass (such as a
black hole). In the self-gravitating dark matter limit, the predicted cored
soliton shape is consistent with previous numerical predictions and analytical
approximations. As the dark matter mass fraction decreases, the soliton is
predicted to become increasingly cusp shaped, asymptotically approaching an
exponential density distribution (isomorphic with a Hydrogen 1s state), with a
central slope comparable to that predicted by cold dark matter simulations. The
soliton shapes are obtained by solving the associated Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson
equation with the ground state wavefunction represented as a sum of Gaussians
with numerically optimized amplitudes and widths. The results are used to
express the soliton size, total mass and density directly in terms of the
corresponding velocity dispersion, by invoking an approximation relating tracer
star rotational velocity and dispersion that is validated by experimental
observations. Applications of the predictions, as well as challenges associated
with critically testing dark matter models, are illustrated using comparisons
with dwarf spheroidal (dSph) and ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxy observations.
Implications include speculations regarding the possible role of dark matter
evaporation in galactic evolution, as well as a light-dark-matter hypothesis
that dark matter solitons may be photon condensates, if photons have a non-zero
rest mass consistent with the upper bounds established by a wide range of
optical and electrodynamic measurements.

### [16] [Dense clumps survive in the vicinity of R136 in 30 Doradus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01390)

**TL;DR**: 研究分析了位于30 Doradus中心的R136星团附近的Stapler星云中分子气体的性质，揭示了这些气体云在R136辐射下存活的原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 年轻大质量星团R136位于大麦哲伦云（LMC）的30 Doradus中心，其周围形成了一个空腔，但在距离R136中心2至10 pc的投影范围内仍存在分子气体，即Stapler星云。

Data: 使用了Atacama Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array（ALMA）7m阵列在Band 7（345 GHz）的连续谱、12CO、13CO以及稠密气体示踪剂CS、HCO+和HCN的观测数据。

Method: 通过尘埃和分子发射确定了星云中分子云团的物理性质，并将靠近R136的发射特性与LMC中其他云团进行了比较。

Result: 稠密云团集中在西北-东南对角线上，其质量在200至2500太阳质量之间，速度弥散由自引力和外部气体压力共同导致，且与年轻恒星天体空间重合。

Abstract: Context: The young massive cluster R136 at the center of 30 Doradus (30 Dor)
in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) generates a cavity in the surrounding
molecular cloud. However, there is molecular gas between 2 and 10 pc in
projection from R136's center. The region, known as the Stapler nebula, hosts
the closest known molecular gas clouds to R136. Aims: We investigated the
properties of molecular gas in the Stapler nebula to better understand why
these clouds survive so close in projection to R136. Methods: We used Atacama
Large Millimeter/Sub-millimeter Array 7m observations in Band 7 (345 GHz) of
continuum emission, $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO, together with dense gas tracers
CS, HCO$^+$, and HCN. Our observations resolve the molecular clouds in the
nebula into individual, parsec-sized clumps. We determined the physical
properties of the clumps using both dust and molecular emission, and compared
the emission properties observed close to R136 to other clouds in the LMC.
Results: The densest clumps in our sample, where we observe CS, HCO$^+$, and
HCN, are concentrated in a northwest-southeast diagonal seen as a dark dust
lane in HST images. Resolved clumps have masses between $\sim 200-2500$ \Msun,
and the values obtained using the virial theorem are larger than the masses
obtained through $^{12}$CO and $^{12}$CO luminosity. The velocity dispersion of
the clumps is due both to self-gravity and the external pressure of the gas.
Clumps at the center of our map, which have detections of dense gas tracers
($n_{crit}\sim10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ and above), are spatially coincident with young
stellar objects. Conclusions: The clumps' physical and chemical properties are
consistent with other clumps in 30 Dor. We suggest that these clumps are the
densest regions of a Molecular Cloud carved by the radiation of R136.

**TL;DR**: 通过DFT计算研究了中性及带电ASW表面上CO、CH4和NH3的结合能，发现CO的结合能因表面电荷增加，CH4的结合能不变，而NH3的结合能通常降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星际介质（ISM）中已发现300多种分子，但由于极低温度，气相化学主要由自由基和离子的无势垒放热反应主导。然而，一些丰富分子和有机分子无法通过气相反应高效生成，因此需考虑小分子与覆盖无定形固态水（ASW）的尘埃颗粒之间的气-固相互作用。表面电荷可能影响分子结合能。

Data: 本研究使用DFT计算分析了CO、CH4和NH3在中性和带电ASW表面上的结合能。

Method: 采用密度泛函理论（DFT）计算中性及带电ASW表面上CO、CH4和NH3的结合能。

Result: 结果表明，CO的结合能因表面电荷而增加，CH4的结合能不受表面电荷影响，而NH3的结合能通常降低。

Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) is all but empty. To date, more than 300
molecules have already been discovered. Because of the extremely low
temperature, the gas-phase chemistry is dominated by barrierless exothermic
reactions of radicals and ions. However, several abundant molecules and organic
molecules cannot be produced efficiently by gas-phase reactions. To explain the
existence of such molecules in the ISM, gas-surface interactions between small
molecules and dust particles covered with amorphous solid water (ASW) mantles
must be considered. In general, surface processes such as adsorption,
diffusion, desorption, and chemical reactions can be linked to the binding
energy of molecules to the surface. Hence, a lot of studies have been performed
to identify the binding energies of interstellar molecules on ASW surfaces.
Cosmic radiation and free electrons may induce a negative charge on the dust
particles, and the binding energies may be affected by this charge. In this
study, we calculate the binding energies of CO, CH4, and NH3, on neutral and
charged ASW surfaces using DFT calculations. Our results indicate that CO can
interact with the surface charge, increasing its binding energy. In contrast,
the binding energy of CH4 remains unchanged in the presence of surface charge,
and that of NH3 typically decreases.

**TL;DR**: This study investigates how measurement errors in proper motions, distances, and host halo mass affect the inferred stability of satellite planes in Milky-Way-like potentials, revealing significant impacts on orbital stability analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Observations show that some galaxies, like the Milky Way and Andromeda, host thin and kinematically coherent satellite planes, which are unlikely in the standard LCDM cosmological model. The stability of these planes is debated due to insufficient constraints on orbital parameters and host galaxy gravitational potential.

Data: The study uses simulated test satellite galaxies orbiting a host galaxy, with mock observations incorporating various observational errors.

Method: The research involves simulating satellite galaxies, adding observational errors to mock data, backward-integrating orbits, and analyzing trends between initial conditions and uncertainties on orbital stability. Effects of incorrect potentials and orbital eccentricities are also considered.

Result: Uncertainties in proper motions linearly increase the inferred width of stable satellite planes, while low halo mass potentials significantly impact stability. Satellite distance uncertainties also contribute to apparent instability, with Gaia-level systematics strongly affecting past width inferences.

Abstract: Observations have revealed that the MW, Andromeda, Centaurus A (and
potentially other galaxies) host spatially thin and kinematically coherent
planes of satellites. Such structures are highly improbable within the standard
LCDM cosmological model, and the dynamical stability of these planes has been a
subject of debate for a long time. Accurately determining their stability
requires a thorough understanding of orbital parameters such as proper motion,
distance, and line-of-sight velocity, in addition to the gravitational
potential of the host galaxy. However, many of these remain insufficiently
constrained, leading to significant uncertainties in any analysis. This
research aims to explore the impact of measurement errors in proper motions and
distances of the satellite galaxies and in the adopted host halo mass on the
inferred stability of satellite planes in Milky-Way-like potentials. Test
satellite galaxies orbiting a host galaxy are simulated, mock observed by
adding various degrees and types of observational errors, and then
backward-integrated. Trends and correlations between the initial conditions and
the applied uncertainties on the inferred orbital stability of the satellite
systems are analyzed. Additionally, the effects of adopting incorrect
potentials and the impact of different orbital eccentricities are considered.
Uncertainties in proper motions lead to an inferred, ostensible widening of an
intrinsically stable satellite plane, with its width increasing linearly with
the adopted proper motion uncertainties. Even uncertainties on the level of
Gaia systematics strongly affect the plane's inferred past width. Moreover, the
potential with a low halo mass showed a significant impact on the stability of
these planes, while the remaining two host models showed similar effects.
Uncertainties in satellite distance also contribute noticeably to the inferred,
apparent instability.

Background: 星际线性偏振是由星光通过被星际磁场排列的尘埃颗粒时产生的，观测到的偏振可能来自视线方向上不同的尘埃结构。结合偏振测量和恒星距离可以研究视线方向上的银河系平面磁场（GMF），并分离具有不同GMF特性的云的贡献。

Abstract: Interstellar linear polarization occurs when starlight passes through
elongated dust grains aligned by interstellar magnetic fields. The observed
polarization can come from different dust structures along the line of sight
(LOS). By combining polarization measurements with stellar distances, we can
study the plane-of-sky Galactic magnetic field (GMF) between the observer and
the star and separate the contributions of clouds with different GMF
properties. We used optical and near-infrared (NIR) polarization data from
three regions in the Galactic plane ($|b|<1^{\circ}$ and
$19.\!\!^{\circ}8<l<25.\!\!^{\circ}5$) to perform a polarization decomposition
across the Galactic arms. A comparison between optical and NIR data showed an
optical-to-NIR polarization ratio of 2 to 3 along the LOS and a consistent
polarization angle across both wavelengths in all studied regions, within
measurement uncertainties. We applied the Bayesian Inference of Starlight
Polarization in one dimension and the Gaussian Mixture Model methods to
decompose the polarization in the three regions. Optical and NIR observations
complemented each other, consistently identifying nearby ($d\lesssim143$ pc),
intermediate ($0.47$ kpc $< d < 1.2$ kpc), and distant ($1.5$ kpc $< d < 2.5$
kpc) polarizing clouds, in agreement with previous findings in the Local Bubble
wall, the Local arm, and the Sagittarius arm dust structures. The results from
both polarization decomposition methods agree and complement each other.
Polarization tomography revealed significant LOS variations in the plane-of-sky
magnetic field orientation in two of the three regions. The relative alignment
between the magnetic fields traced by starlight polarization and Planck's
polarized thermal dust emission at 353 GHz reaffirmed these variations.

Background: 原子氢（HI）是冷星际介质的主要组成部分，通过热凝结形成分子气体并促进恒星形成。冷HI成分是介于扩散暖中性气体和分子氢（H2）之间的关键过渡相。

Data: 使用了七种附近星系（Sextans A、NGC 6822、WLM、NGC 5068、NGC 7793、NGC 1566和NGC 5236）的HI 21 cm数据立方体，覆盖金属丰度范围0.1到1.0太阳金属丰度和物理尺度53到1134 pc。

Result: 研究发现矮星系在500-700 pc尺度上冷HI与H2或SFR的相关性最强；矮星系的冷HI比例（fn）与金属丰度或SFR无明确趋势，而螺旋星系的fn在金属丰度和SFR较高的内区较低；数据分辨率对结果有显著影响，高分辨率数据显示更高的fn。

Abstract: Atomic hydrogen (HI) dominates the mass of the cold interstellar medium,
undergoing thermal condensation to form molecular gas and fuel star formation.
Kinematically colder HI components, identified via kinematic decomposition of
HI 21 cm data cubes, serve as a crucial transition phase between diffuse warm
neutral gas and molecular hydrogen (H$_{2}$). We analyse these colder HI
components by decomposing HI 21 cm data cubes of seven nearby galaxies -
Sextans A, NGC 6822, WLM, NGC 5068, NGC 7793, NGC 1566, and NGC 5236 - spanning
metallicities (0.1 < $Z/Z_{\odot}$ < 1.0) and physical scales (53-1134 pc).
Using a velocity dispersion threshold of 6 km s$^{-1}$, we classify the
kinematically distinct components into narrow (colder) and broad (warmer).
Cross-correlation analysis between the narrow HI components and H$_{2}$ or star
formation rate (SFR) surface density at different spatial scales reveals that
dwarf galaxies exhibit the strongest correlation at ~500-700 pc. The radially
binned narrow HI fraction, $f_{\rm n} = I_{\rm narrowHI}/I_{\rm totalHI}$, in
dwarf galaxies shows no clear trend with metallicity or SFR, while in spirals,
$f_{\rm n}$ is lower in inner regions with higher metallicity and SFR. We find
that the dataset resolution significantly impacts the results, with higher
physical resolution data yielding a higher median $f_{\rm n}$, $\langle f_{\rm
n} \rangle$, per galaxy. With this considered, dwarf galaxies consistently
exhibit a larger $f_{\rm n}$ than spiral galaxies. These findings highlight the
critical role of cold HI in regulating star formation across different galactic
environments and emphasise the need for high-resolution HI observations to
further unravel the connection between atomic-to-molecular gas conversion and
galaxy evolution.

Abstract: The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) conducted by the Vera C.
Rubin Observatory will detect millions of supernovae (SNe) and generate
millions of nightly alerts, far outpacing available spectroscopic resources.
Rapid, scalable photometric classification methods are therefore essential for
identifying young SNe for follow-up and enabling large-scale population
studies. We present SPLASH, a host-based classification pipeline that infers
supernova classes using only host galaxy photometry. SPLASH first associates
SNe with their hosts (yielding a redshift estimate), then infers host galaxy
stellar mass and star formation rate using deep learning, and finally
classifies SNe using a random forest trained on these inferred properties,
along with host-SN angular separation and redshift. SPLASH achieves a binary
(Type Ia vs. core-collapse) classification accuracy of $76\%$ and an F1-score
of $69\%$, comparable to other state-of-the-art methods. By selecting only the
most confident predictions, SPLASH can return highly pure subsets of all major
SN types, making it well-suited for targeted follow-up. Its efficient design
allows classification of $\sim 500$ SNe per second, making it ideal for
next-generation surveys. Moreover, its intermediate inference step enables
selection of transients by host environment, providing a tool not only for
classification but also for probing the demographics of stellar death.

Background: 尽管50年前就发现了来自银河系内部的正电子湮灭线，但至今没有一类天体物理源能明确解释其发射形态和通量。暗物质湮灭或衰变产生的正电子曾被提出，但其质量受到高于511 keV的连续γ射线发射的限制。

Data: γ射线线和连续数据

Method: 改进的分析方法，克服了先前分析的局限性，包括对γ射线线和连续数据的相对角分布不确定性的边缘化处理。

Result: 研究发现正电子注入能量的限制比之前声称的要弱得多，数据支持初始能量高达约50 MeV。

Abstract: Even 50 years after the discovery of a positron annihilation line from the
inner Galaxy, no class of astrophysical sources has emerged as a definitive
explanation for both the emission morphology and flux. Positrons produced by
dark matter annihilation or decay have been proposed, but the mass of any such
candidate is constrained by continuum $\gamma$-ray emission at energies $>511$
keV. Earlier analyses have claimed that this emission requires that the
positrons have kinetic energies less than a few MeV at injection, disfavoring
both much of the dark matter parameter space and many potential compact
astrophysical source classes such as pulsars. However, these constraints were
not based on a full forward model of the $\gamma$-ray line and continuum data,
and did not marginalize over uncertainties about the relative angular
distributions of the line and continuum. Here we describe an improved analysis
that overcomes these limitations, and show that constraints on the injection
energy are much weaker than previously claimed; even under conservative
assumptions the data are consistent with initial energies up to $\sim 50$ MeV.

### [23] [Low-velocity precessing jets can explain observed morphologies in the Twin Radio Galaxy TRG J104454+354055](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01428)

**TL;DR**: 通过3D流体动力学模拟研究了第三对双射电星系J104454+354055的双极喷流，发现相互倾斜的双极喷流在低速度传播时可以通过进动解释观测到的形态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 在VLA、VLBA/EVN、uGMRT和MeerKAT时代，我们对合并系统中大尺度射电喷流的理解有了显著提升。双射电星系（TRGs）是罕见的相互作用星系对，其中两个超大质量黑洞都拥有千秒差距尺度的双极射电喷流。最近发现的第三对TRG显示出与前两对显著不同的喷流形态。由于这类系统的极端稀缺性和复杂性，喷流的发射及其在传播过程中与周围介质的相互作用尚未被充分理解。

Data: 研究使用了第三对双射电星系J104454+354055的数据。

Method: 采用了3D流体动力学模拟方法。

Result: 模拟结果表明，两个相距数十千秒差距的星系核中相互倾斜的双极喷流在低速度传播时可以通过进动解释观测到的形态。喷流进动时间尺度相对于喷流的整体动力学时间尺度较短，可能源于吸积盘中的Lense-Thirring效应。这一方法也可应用于未来SKA及其前导巡天中可能发现的具有类似螺旋形态的其他TRG系统。

Abstract: Our understanding of large-scale radio jets in merger systems has been
drastically improved in the era of VLA, VLBA/EVN, uGMRT, and MeerKAT. Twin
Radio Galaxies (TRGs) are the rare interacting galaxy pairs where both
supermassive black holes host kiloparsec-scale bipolar radio jets. Only
recently was a third TRG discovered and it shows significantly different jet
morphologies than the previous two. Due to both the extreme paucity and
complexity of such systems, the launching of their jets as well as their mutual
interaction during the propagation through the ambient medium are not well
understood. We have performed 3D hydrodynamic simulations to study the bipolar
jets in the third TRG, J104454+354055. Our study indicates that the precession
of mutually tilted bipolar jets originating from the two galactic nuclei
separated by tens of kiloparsecs and propagating at low velocities can explain
the observed morphologies. The simulated jet precession timescales are short
compared to the overall dynamical timescale of the jets and could originate
from Lense-Thirring effects in the accretion disks. This approach to
understanding the TRG jet dynamics could also be applied to other TRG systems
with similar helical morphologies that may be discovered in the upcoming era of
the SKA and its pathfinder surveys.

**TL;DR**: 通过分析VLT/FLAMES BLOeM光谱调查数据，确定了778颗OB星的物理性质，包括温度、表面重力、光度和旋转速度，并发现单星和双星系统的旋转速度分布存在显著差异。

  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究旨在利用VLT/FLAMES BLOeM光谱调查数据确定小麦哲伦云中OB星的物理性质，填补了现有研究中关于OB星物理性质及其在单星和双星系统中差异的不足。

Data: 使用了VLT/FLAMES BLOeM光谱调查的9个初始历元的共加数据，分析了778颗OB星的光谱数据。

Method: 采用了一种设计用于分析大量OB星光谱的流程，结合FASTWIND恒星大气代码生成的合成模型光谱网格，并使用贝叶斯推断方法结合小麦哲伦云金属丰度演化模型。

Result: 确定了778颗OB星的物理性质（如Teff、log g、log L/Lsun和v_e sin i），发现单星和双星系统的旋转速度分布显著不同，并提供了小麦哲伦云中O星的更新目录。

Abstract: We aim to determine the physical properties of OB stars from the multi-epoch
VLT/FLAMES BLOeM spectroscopic survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud. We apply a
pipeline designed to analyse large spectroscopic samples of OB stars to the
co-added, initial 9 epochs of the BLOeM survey, utilising grids of synthetic
model spectra computed with the stellar atmosphere code FASTWIND. 69 OB stars
are excluded from the analysis owing to disk emission or significant
contamination by secondaries in SB2 binaries. We determine physical properties
of 778 OB stars, including Teff, log g, log L/Lsun and v_e sin i. There appears
to be a bimodality in v_e sin i of single O stars, while v_e sin i
distributions of OB stars are strikingly different for single (median 78 km/s)
and binary (median 200 km/s) systems. Inferred temperatures are broadly in
agreement with literature results for stars in common, plus results from a
grid-based automization tool for a subset of O and early B stars, although
uncertainties are larger for surface gravities. Rotational velocities are
broadly in line with an independent tool applied to the same subset. We recover
the anticipated lower mass cutoff at 8 Msun from the survey design using a
Bayesian inference method coupled with SMC metallicity evolutionary models,
with median masses of 12.6 Msun (19.8 Msun) for B-type (O-type) stars.
Spectroscopic masses exceed evolutionary masses, albeit with large
uncertainties in surface gravities. We also provide an updated catalogue of O
stars in the SMC since half of the 159 BLOeM O stars are newly classified as
O-type stars.

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过恒星演化模型揭示了形成冷超巨星所需的关键金属丰度（Zc约0.001）的物理起源，并阐明了金属丰度如何通过影响TAMS半径决定恒星演化路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域关注恒星演化过程中金属丰度对超巨星形成的影响，但关键金属丰度的物理起源尚不明确。

Data: 研究使用了不同质量、金属丰度、不透明度和核反应速率的模型网格数据。

Method: 通过恒星模型和同源关系分析金属丰度对TAMS半径的影响，并分类超巨星的演化路径。

Result: 研究发现金属丰度通过影响TAMS半径决定恒星是否进入红超巨星阶段，解释了关键金属丰度的起源，并为早期宇宙中贫金属大质量恒星的演化提供了新见解。

Abstract: This study investigates the physical origin of the critical metallicity
($Z_{\rm c}\sim 0.001$) required for the formation of cool supergiants, as
revealed by stellar evolution models. Using model grids that vary in mass,
metallicity, opacity, and nuclear reaction rates, we identify a threshold
terminal-age main-sequence (TAMS) radius ($R_{\rm T}$) that determines whether
a star of a given mass can evolve into the red supergiant (RSG) phase. Through
stellar models and homology relations, we show that metallicity affects the
TAMS radius via its influence on opacity and nuclear energy generation. By
classifying the evolutionary pathways of supergiants, we demonstrate how TAMS
radius, shaped by metallicity, decisively governs the post-main-sequence
outcome: Stars with metallicities $Z < Z_{\rm c}$ exhibit TAMS radii smaller
than $R_{\rm T}$ and proceed to advanced core helium or carbon burning while
retaining compact envelopes, thereby preventing further expansion into the RSG
regime. In contrast, stars with $Z > Z_{\rm c}$ have TAMS radii larger than
$R_{\rm T}$ and expand into the stable RSG phase during core helium burning.
The envelope radius at the onset of core helium burning is the key factor
determining whether a star becomes a red or blue supergiant. Our results
explain the origin of the critical metallicity and offer insight into the
evolution of metal-poor massive stars in the early universe.
