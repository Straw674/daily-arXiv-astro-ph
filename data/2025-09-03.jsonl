This\nsteeper slope arises from the interplay between scattering and the dust disk\nbecoming more extended over time (changes in star-dust geometry). At higher\ninclination, scattering is suppressed, and the attenuation curves slightly\nsteepen over time due to small-grain formation and the bias of observed UV\nlight toward older stars. The bump strengthens on a timescale of ~250 Myr due\nto the formation of small carbonaceous grains. The bump strength is affected\nnot only by the abundance of small grains but also by star-dust geometry. At\nhigher $A_V$ or higher inclination, the bump weakens. These results may help\ninterpret flatter attenuation curves and weaker bumps in high-redshift\ngalaxies. Variations in star-dust geometry alter the amount of scattered\nphotons escaping the galaxy, driving the anti-correlation between the slope and\n$A_V$. Scatter in this relation arises from differences in dust optical depth\nalong and perpendicular to the line of sight, reflecting inclination and\nstar-dust geometry. Additional contributions come from variations in grain size\ndistribution and the fraction of obscured young stars."}

Arrays of\nsensors in space missions are typically contiguous and act as a monolithic\ndetector. A non-contiguous array, with gaps between individual commercial CMOS\ndetectors, offers potential cost and schedule benefits but poses a unique\nchallenge for stray/scattered light mitigation due to complexities in the\noptomechanics. For example, if the array of detectors is being fed a large\nfield of view, then each detector will have a different angle of incidence. Any\nindividual bandpass filters need to be held perpendicular to the incoming beam\nso as not to create variances of central wavelength transmission from detector\nto detector. It naturally follows that the optical design can force filter\nghosts to fall between detectors. When dealing with well-focused,\nhigh-intensity beams, first and second order stray light path analyses must be\nconducted to determine scattered light from glints off of individual\noptics/opto-mechanics or detector specific vane structures.

The combination of lensing with deep\nspectroscopic data reveals a rotation curve that is inconsistent with a nuclear\nstar cluster, yet can be well explained by Keplerian rotation around a point\nmass of 50 million Solar masses, consistent with virial BH mass estimates from\nthe Balmer lines. The Keplerian rotation leaves little room for any stellar\ncomponent in a host galaxy, as we conservatively infer $M_{\\rm BH}/M_{*}>2$.\nSuch a ''naked'' black hole, together with its near-pristine environment,\nindicates that this LRD is a massive black hole seed caught in its earliest\naccretion phase."}

Motivated by recent advances in black hole imaging and\nprecision measurements in strong gravity, we explore light propagation, wave\ndynamics, and observational signatures in such geometries. We begin by\nanalyzing the background spacetime and matter content, examining the horizon\nstructure and verifying the energy conditions associated with the anisotropic\nfluid. We then study photon trajectories in both vacuum and plasma\nenvironments, deriving the equations of motion and computing deflection angles\nand image magnifications under weak gravitational lensing. Both uniform and\npower-law plasma profiles are considered to model realistic astrophysical\nsettings. In the wave optics regime, we first analyze the linear stability of\nthe spacetime under axial (odd-parity) perturbations using Chandrasekhar's\nmethod, and then investigate scalar field scattering by solving the wave\nequation in the curved background with plasma. Using Born and WKB\napproximations, we compute the differential scattering cross-sections and\nexamine how anisotropy and plasma affect interference features. Finally, we\nperform parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to\nconstrain the black hole mass and anisotropic fluid parameters, utilizing EHT\nand GRAVITY data for Sgr A* and EHT-only data for M87*. These results present a\nunified theoretical framework that links anisotropic matter effects with\nlensing and scattering observables providing a firm basis for future\ncomparisons with high-resolution astrophysical data sets in diverse contexts."}

We found strong evidence for the presence of a hot (T > 20000 K)\nWD companion to one of the investigated BSS, indicating that it likely formed\nthrough mass transfer less than 12 Myr ago.

Stellar axial rotation also has a strong impact on the structure and\nevolution of massive stars. In this study, we exploit the large grid of GENEC\nmodels, covering initial masses from 9 to 500 $M_{\\odot}$ and metallicities\nranging from $Z=10^{-5}$ (nearly zero) to 0.02 (supersolar), to determine the\nimpact of rotation on their fate across cosmic times. Using the carbon-oxygen\ncore mass and envelope composition as indicators of their fate, we predict\nstellar remnants, supernova engines, and spectroscopic supernova types for both\nrotating and non-rotating stars. We derive rates of the different supernova and\nremnant types considering two initial mass functions to help solve puzzles such\nas the absence of observed pair-instability supernovae. We find that rotation\nsignificantly alters the remnant type and supernova engine, with rotating stars\nfavouring black hole formation at lower initial masses than their non-rotating\ncounterparts. Additionally, we confirm the expected strong metallicity\ndependence of the fates with a maximum black hole mass predicted to be below 50\n$M_{\\odot}$ at SMC or higher metallicities. A pair-instability mass gap is\npredicted between about 90 and 150 $M_{\\odot}$, with the most massive black\nholes below the gap found at the lowest metallicities. Considering the fate of\nmassive single stars has far-reaching consequences across many different fields\nwithin astrophysics, and understanding the impact of rotation and metallicity\nwill improve our understanding of how massive stars end their lives, and their\nimpact on the universe."}

We then add\nvariability modulations by using six 3D hydrodynamic simulations of accreting\nMBHBs with different eccentricities and mass ratios as templates. To make the\nlight curves realistic, we mimic the LSST observation patterns and cadence, and\nwe include stochastic variability and LSST photometric errors.
