Leveraging PHANGS-JWST Cycle 1\nand PHANGS-MUSE data, we measure the PAH and dust continuum emission lifetimes\nof gas clouds across 17 nearby star-forming galaxies by analyzing the relative\nspatial distributions of mid-IR (7.7-11.3$\\mu$m) and H$\\alpha$ emission at\nvarious scales. We find that the mid-IR emitting time-scale of gas clouds in\ngalaxy disks (excluding centers) ranges from 10 to 30Myr. After star formation\nis detected in H$\\alpha$, mid-IR emission persists for 3-7Myr during the\nstellar feedback phase, covering 70-80% of the H$\\alpha$ emission. This\nsignificant overlap is due to intense radiation from star-forming regions,\nilluminating the surrounding PAHs and dust grains. In most galaxies, the mid-IR\ntime-scale closely matches the molecular cloud lifetime measured with CO.\nAlthough mid-IR emission is complex as influenced by ISM distribution,\nradiation, and abundances of dust and PAHs, the similarity between the two\ntime-scales suggests that once gas clouds form with compact mid-IR emission,\nthey quickly provide sufficient shielding for stable CO formation. This is\nlikely due to our focus on molecular gas-rich regions of galaxies with\nnear-solar metallicity. Finally, we find that the mid-IR emitting time-scale is\nlonger in galaxies with well-defined HII regions and less structured\nbackgrounds, allowing photons to more efficiently heat the ambient ISM\nsurrounding the HII regions, rather than contributing to diffuse emission.

This trail includes the remarkable, ultra-diffuse galaxies DF2 and\nDF4 which lack dark matter and host unusually luminous globular clusters. It\nhas been proposed that the trail formed via a high-speed collision between two\ngas-rich dwarf galaxies. This scenario predicts that the trail galaxies are\nkinematically connected and follow a specific trend in radial velocity as a\nfunction of position, based on the known velocities and positions of DF2 and\nDF4. To test this hypothesis, we measured radial velocities for seven\nadditional galaxies on the trail. While the galaxies' low surface brightnesses\npresented observational challenges, we employ several methods to obtain\nmeasurements for galaxies with effective surface brightnesses up to 28.6 mag\narcsec$^{-2}$, including a narrow slit placed over globular clusters and a\nnovel wide slit mode on Keck/LRIS, as well as a 'light bucket' mode on\nKeck/KCWI. We find that five of our seven targets follow the precise velocity\ntrend predicted by DF2 and DF4, to a degree with just a 2% chance of randomly\noccurring. Moreover, the trail galaxies' radial velocities are significantly\nhigher than those of the NGC 1052 group, setting it apart as a separate,\nkinematically connected system.

We then compare the Ba abundances derived from the\nsubordinate lines with those from the Ba II resonance lines. We find a higher\ns-process contribution to Ba isotopes in stars with greater [Sr/Eu] and [Sr/Ba]\noverabundances, suggesting that the additional Sr synthesis was due to the\nearly s-process occurring in massive stars. We estimate the [Sr/Ba] ratio\nproduced by the early s-process and obtain [Sr/Ba]_earlyS = 1.1 +- 0.2.\nRegarding the potential synthesis of Sr and Ba in the i-process in massive\nstars, our results argue that there was no detectable contribution from this\nprocess within the error bars in our sample stars. In the early Galaxy, before\nsignificant main s-process enrichment, barium and strontium were produced\nprimarily by the main r-process and the early s-process, which occurred in\nrapidly rotating massive stars."}

This ``Keenan--Barger--Cowie (KBC) void'', ``Local\nHole'', or ``local supervoid'', would have significant ramifications for the\nHubble tension by generating outflows that masquerade as an enhanced local\nexpansion rate. We evaluate models for the KBC void capable of resolving the\nHubble tension with a background Planck cosmology.

Depending on the adopted void\ndensity profile, we find the derived velocity fields to prefer a void size of\nless than 70 Mpc, which is less than 10 per cent of the fiducial size found by\nHaslbauer et al. based on the KBC luminosity density data. The predicted local\nHubble constant is $72.1^{+0.9}_{-0.8}$, $70.4^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$, or\n$70.2^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ km/s/Mpc for an initial underdensity profile that is\nexponential, Gaussian, or Maxwell-Boltzmann, respectively. The latter two\nameliorate the Hubble tension to within $3\\sigma$ of the 4-anchor distance\nladder approach of Breuval et al. giving $73.2 \\pm 0.9$ km/s/Mpc. The\nexponential profile does achieve consistency with this measurement at just over\n$1\\sigma$, but it is disfavoured by the Bayesian evidence.

Ophiuchus\ndisks have the highest median gas mass (6 M$_{\\rm Jup}$), while the Lupus and\nUpper Sco disks have significantly lower median masses (0.68 and 0.44 M$_{\\rm\nJup}$, respectively). Notably, the gas and dust disk masses appear to evolve on\ndifferent timescales. This is evidenced by the median gas-to-dust mass ratio,\nwhich decreases from 122 in the youngest disks ($<$1 Myr) to 46 in Lupus disks,\nand then increases to 120 in the Upper Sco disks. The median gas disk sizes\nrange between 74-110 au, suggesting that typical gas disks are much smaller\nthan those of well-studied, massive disks. Population synthesis models suggest\nthat magneto-hydrodynamic wind-driven accretion can reproduce median disk\nproperties across all three regions, when assuming compact disks with a\ndeclining magnetic field over time.

Using DustPy for the dust\nevolution, and RADMC-3D for the radiative transfer, we ran a large grid of\nmodels spanning stellar masses of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.0 $M_\\odot$, with\ndifferent initial conditions, including: disk sizes, disk gas masses, and\ndust-to-gas ratio, and viscosity. Our models are performed assuming smooth,\nweakly, or strongly substructured disks, aiming to investigate if any\nobservational trend can favor or exclude the presence of dust traps. The\nobserved gas masses in the disks of the AGE-PRO sample are not reproducible\nwith our models, which only consider viscous evolution with constant $\\alpha$,\nsuggesting that additional physical mechanisms play a role in the evolution of\nthe gas mass of disks. When comparing the dust continuum emission fluxes and\nsizes at 1.3 mm, we find that most of the disks in the AGE-PRO sample are\nconsistent with simulations that have either weak or strong dust traps.

To investigate the\nnature of the variability we construct a light curve from the continuum\nobservations and analyse imaged constructed from both flaring and quiescent\nemission. We characterise the dust disk around the star through analysis in the\nimage and visibility plane, and carry out kinematic analysis of the CO(2-1)\nemission from the gas disk. The continuum flux decays by a factor of 8 in less\nthan an hour, and by a factor of 13 within 8 days. The peak brightness\ncoincides with an expected brightness maximum extrapolated from the periodicity\nof previously observed optical variability. The flare is most likely the\nproduct of synchrotron emission in the close vicinity of the star. The nature\nof the millimetre flare closely resembles those detected in very close binary\nsystems, and may be due to the interaction of magnetic fields in an as yet\nundetected binary.

We\nevaluate three representative orbital configurations--non-precessing and\nprecessing with different inclination angles--and analyze their localization\nperformance for various MBBH populations. In the non-precessing case, a\ntwo-hemisphere degeneracy arises when only the dominant (2,2) mode is\nconsidered, which is effectively resolved by including higher-order modes.\nThese modes contribute to a more uniform performance across all configurations,\nthereby mitigating the prior advantage of precessing mission orbits. Sub-mHz\nmissions operating in the [10 $\\mu$Hz, 10 mHz] band partially overlap with\nLISA's range but provide enhanced sensitivity to lower-frequency GWs due to\ntheir longer interferometric baselines.
