We comprehensively described the\nmerger orbital configuration, considering the relative orbital motion of the\nmerger pair and their disk orientations. We quantified the galaxy structures by\ndynamically defining four components: bulge, disk, warm component, and hot\ninner stellar halo.

For mergers\non direct collision orbits, the disk planes of the two galaxies tend to be\nperpendicular to the orbital plane, leading to lower fractions for disk and\nwarm components, as well as higher fractions of the bulge and hot inner stellar\nhalo in the remnant. Mergers can lead to either an increase or decrease in the\ndisk and bulge mass fraction in the remnant compared to the progenitor galaxy,\ndepending on the merger orbital configurations; however, in 93% of cases,\nmergers cause an increase in the hot inner stellar halo.

Submitted to MNRAS", "summary": "We investigate the clustering of Lyman-break galaxies at redshifts of 3\n$\\lesssim z \\lesssim$ 5 within the COSMOS field by measuring the angular\ntwo-point correlation function. Our robust sample of $\\sim$60,000 bright\n($m_{\\rm UV}\\lesssim 27$) Lyman-break galaxies was selected based on spectral\nenergy distribution fitting across 14 photometric bands spanning optical and\nnear-infrared wavelengths. We constrained both the 1- and 2-halo terms at\nseparations up to 300 arcsec, finding an excess in the correlation function at\nscales corresponding to $<20$ kpc, consistent with enhancement due to clumps in\nthe same galaxy or interactions on this scale. We then performed Bayesian model\nfits on the correlation functions to infer the Halo Occupation Distribution\nparameters, star formation duty cycle, and galaxy bias in three redshift bins.\nWe examined several cases where different combinations of parameters were\nvaried, showing that our data can constrain the slope of the satellite\noccupation function, which previous studies have fixed. For an\n$M_{\\rm{UV}}$-limited sub-sample, we found galaxy bias values of\n$b_g=3.18^{+0.14}_{-0.14}$ at $z\\simeq3$, $b_g=3.58^{+0.27}_{-0.29}$ at\n$z\\simeq4$, $b_g=4.27^{+0.25}_{-0.26}$ at $z\\simeq5$.

Previous studies have two\nlimitations: either employing an incorrect formula for self-gravity potential\nin analytical treatments, or introducing additional input parameters in\nnumerical implementations to circumvent solving the full TPBVP. To address\nthese issues, we present a self-consistent TPBVP formulation, solved using the\nrelaxation method. We also derive approximate analytical formulae that enable\nrapid estimates of self-gravity effects. Our analysis identifies a\ndimensionless parameter $\\beta \\equiv 2G \\bar{\\rho}\nr_\\mathrm{out}^2/a_\\mathrm{out}^2$ that characterizes the strength of\nself-gravity, where $\\bar{\\rho}$ and $r_\\mathrm{out}$ are the mean density and\nouter radius of the flow, respectively, and $a_\\mathrm{out}$ is the adiabatic\nsound speed of the external medium. For practical estimation, $\\bar{\\rho}$ may\nbe approximated by the external medium density $\\rho_\\mathrm{out}$. We identify\nan upper limit for $\\beta$, beyond which steady accretion becomes unsustainable\n-- a behavior consistent with classical gravitational instability that previous\nstudies failed to capture. The accretion rate enhancement decreases\nmonotonically as the adiabatic index $\\gamma$ increases. For $\\gamma=5/3$,\nself-gravity ceases to augment the accretion rate. These theoretical\npredictions are validated by our numerical solutions. We further apply our\nresults to two astrophysical scenarios: hyper-Eddington accretion onto\nsupermassive black hole seeds in the early Universe, where self-gravity is\nsignificant; and accretion onto stellar-mass objects embedded in active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN) disks, where self-gravity is non-negligible under certain\nconditions and should be evaluated using $\\beta$.", "AI": {"tldr": "该论文提出了一种自洽的三点边值问题求解方法，解决了球对称吸积中自引力处理的局限性，发现无量纲参数β可量化自引力强度并确定了其上限，揭示了自引力对吸积率的影响随绝热指数γ增大而单调减小的规律，并应用于早期宇宙超大质量黑洞种子和活动星系核盘内恒星级天体的吸积过程。", "background": "该研究属于自引力作用下球对称吸积的理论天体物理领域。", "data": "研究中使用的数据来源于理论推导和数值模拟，通过松弛法求解自洽的三点边值问题，并验证了理论预测。", "method": "采用松弛法求解自洽的三点边值问题，并推导了自引力效应的近似解析公式。", "result": "该研究提出了一个自洽的三点边值问题（TPBVP）公式，通过松弛方法求解，并推导了近似解析公式以快速估计自引力效应，发现无量纲参数β能表征自引力强度且存在稳态吸积的上限，同时吸积率增强随绝热指数γ增加而单调减小，当γ=5/3时自引力不再增加吸积率。"}}

We\nreport deep stacked images obtained using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope\nthat display faint activity.

The visible/near-infrared spectral slope of\nthe object is red, comparable to 1I/`Oumuamua. The object will be observable\nuntil September 2025, unobservable near perihelion due to low solar elongation,\nand observable again in November. This limitation unfortunately prohibits\ndetailed observations at perihelion when the activity of 3I/ATLAS is likely to\npeak. Based on the experience of 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, we ask the\ncommunity to maintain a constant observational presence while possible with\nphotometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric methods. Such observational data\nwould constrain the (i) light curve, (ii) onset and variation of activity, and\n(iii) nongravitational effects.
