In the low-extinction regions of the Ursa Major\nmolecular cloud complex, we demonstrate that Galactic dust reddening maps\nconstructed from observations of far-infrared emission are insensitive to\nvariations in the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and, as\na result, to PAH-induced variations in reddening. Using galaxy counts to\nvalidate various reddening maps, we find evidence that maps based on\nfar-infrared emission erroneously under-predict reddening compared to stellar\nreddening maps. This underestimation by far-infrared emission based reddening\nmaps -- representing the largest discrepancy between maps of up to\n$E(B-V)=0.08$ mag -- is correlated with the relative brightness of PAH\nemission. Furthermore, we demonstrate theoretically that changes in PAH\nabundance via accretion from the gas phase is capable of altering extinction\nsignificantly with only minor changes to far-infrared emission. We show that\nmodeling the extinction of Ursa Major using both far-infrared and mid-infrared\nemission more accurately traces dust extinction variations due to changes in\nPAH abundance.

Allocating over half of a GC's current mass to WDs could\nsignificantly restrict the dynamical evolution scenarios governing stellar\nclusters. As the most massive stars in GCs, black holes (BHs) exert a\nsubstantial effect on the escape rate of lower mass stars, such as WDs.

We present an holistic framework that we dub `Parametrized\nPost-Newtonian Cosmology' (PPNC), which can be used for obtaining\ntheory-agnostic constraints on deviations from GR using a single unified set of\nparameters that apply on all astrophysical and cosmological scales. Our\napproach is based on the formalism and philosophy of the highly successful\nParametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) framework, but allows us to combine\nobservations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic\nOscillations (BAOs) with Solar System observations of the Cassini probe and\nephemeris of Mars. The full combination of these data sets constrains average\ndeviations from GR over the history of the Universe to be less than $\\sim\n10\\%$, with PPNC parameter values $\\bar{\\alpha}=0.97^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$ and\n$\\bar{\\gamma}=0.97^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ at the $68\\%$ confidence level (GR\ncorresponds to $\\bar{\\alpha}=\\bar{\\gamma}=1$).

One challenge is accurate measurement of\nthe physical properties of massive protostars, such as current stellar mass,\nenvelope mass, outflow cavity properties, and system orientation.

The far-infrared SED traces cold dust in envelopes, while the\nnear- and mid-infrared (MIR) probes emission from outflow cavities and/or the\ninner envelope.

Here, we develop image\nprofile (IMPRO) fitting as a method to improve the characterization of\nprotostars. We utilize brightness distributions from multi-wavelength MIR\nimages of massive protostars taken by SOFIA/FORCAST as part of the SOFIA\nMassive Star Formation (SOMA) survey to constrain protostellar properties via\ncomparison to a grid of radiative transfer models. We develop a fitting\npipeline to extract information along the outflow axis, which is then combined\nwith the SED fitting to yield improved constraints on protostellar properties.\nWe apply the IMPRO fitting method on the nearby massive protostar Cepheus A,\nfinding that its properties become more tightly constrained compared to SED\nfitting, especially in the inclination of the source.
