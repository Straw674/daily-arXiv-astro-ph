### [1] [The AURORA Survey: Tracing Galactic Outflows at $z\gtrsim2.5$ with JWST/NIRSpec NUV Absorption Lines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17381)
*Emily Kehoe,Alice E. Shapley,Ryan L. Sanders,Naveen A. Reddy,Michael W. Topping,Natalie Lam,Leonardo Clarke,Fergus Cullen,Richard S. Ellis,N. M. Forster Schreiber,Tucker Jones,Ali Ahmad Khostovan,Derek J. McLeod,Ross J. McLure,Desika Narayanan,Pascal Oesch,Anthony J. Pahl*

**TL;DR**: 研究利用JWST/NIRSpec AURORA项目的数据，首次直接比较了早期宇宙和现代星系中恒星形成驱动的外流性质，发现外流速度与星系质量、恒星形成率等参数相关，并验证了不同示踪剂测量结果的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星系尺度的外流在星系演化中扮演重要角色，但早期宇宙中外流性质与现代星系的直接比较研究较少。本研究填补了这一空白，并探讨了恒星形成反馈对星系演化的长期影响。

Data: 使用了JWST/NIRSpec AURORA项目的数据，包括41个星系的Fe II吸收线和43个星系的Mg II吸收线，以及10个星系的Na D吸收线。

Method: 通过分析近紫外吸收线（Fe II和Mg II）和远紫外特征，测量了星际介质动力学，并比较了不同示踪剂的测量结果。

Result: 研究发现外流速度与星系质量、恒星形成率、尘埃衰减等参数正相关，且Mg II发射在低质量、高比恒星形成率和低尘埃星系中更常见。这些趋势与现代星系的研究结果一致，验证了恒星形成反馈的持久作用。

Abstract: We probe galactic-scale outflows in star-forming galaxies at $z\gtrsim2.5$
drawn from the JWST/NIRSpec AURORA program. For the first time, we directly
compare outflow properties from the early universe to the present day using
near-UV absorption lines. We measure ISM kinematics from Fe II and Mg II
absorption features in 41 and 43 galaxies, respectively, and examine how these
kinematics correlate with galaxy properties. We find that galaxies with
outflows tend to have higher stellar masses, and that maximum outflow
velocities increase with stellar mass, SFR, $\beta$, $E(B-V)$, and $A_V$. We
also find that Mg II emission is more common in galaxies with lower masses,
higher sSFRs, and less dust. These trends are consistent with those in
star-forming galaxies at $z<2$ when using the same outflow tracers, suggesting
that the feedback from star formation has played a persistent role in shaping
galaxy evolution over cosmic time. We also directly compare near-UV and far-UV
features in the same NIRSpec spectrum for a $z=5.19$ galaxy, finding consistent
ISM kinematics and demonstrating that different tracers yield comparable
measurements. We also detect Na D absorption in 10 galaxies, which have higher
stellar mass, SFR, and dust attenuation compared to galaxies without Na D
absorption, which is consistent with $z\sim0$ studies. The broad continuum
coverage and sensitivity of NIRSpec will enable future studies with larger
samples, allowing for robust tests of these trends across a wider dynamic range
of galaxy properties.

*Marcel Bernet,Pau Ramos,Teresa Antoja,Adrian Price-Whelan,Steven L. Brunton,Tetsuro Asano,Alexandra Girón-Soto*

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过分析潮汐扰动对银河系螺旋臂的影响，结合模拟和数据驱动方法，提出了描述潮汐诱导螺旋臂动力学的线性与非线性方程模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 理解银河系螺旋臂的动力学是一个关键的科学问题，潮汐扰动（如人马座矮星系的近期通过）可能在激发螺旋臂中起重要作用。

Data: 研究使用了理想化的测试粒子模拟、真实的N体模拟（模拟银河系与人马座矮星系的相遇）以及Gaia卫星的LZ-VR波数据。

Method: 采用了稀疏识别非线性动力学（SINDy）方法，从模拟数据中推断控制螺旋臂动力学的偏微分方程（PDEs），并结合解析推导和N体模拟验证。

Result: 研究发现，小扰动下SINDy恢复了线性方程组，与大扰动下发现的非线性方程组共同描述了螺旋臂的波特性（如振幅和模式速度）。线性模型对Gaia数据的拟合提供了合理的参数，但观测与预测的振幅比不一致，表明螺旋臂可能有更复杂的起源。

Abstract: Understanding the spiral arms of the Milky Way (MW) remains a key open
question in galactic dynamics. Tidal perturbations, such as the recent passage
of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr), could play a significant role in
exciting them. We aim to analytically characterize the dynamics of tidally
induced spiral arms, including their phase-space signatures. We ran idealized
test-particle simulations resembling impulsive satellite impacts, and used the
Sparse Identification of Non-linear Dynamics (SINDy) method to infer their
governing Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). We validated the method with
analytical derivations and a realistic $N$-body simulation of a MW-Sgr
encounter analogue. For small perturbations, a linear system of equations was
recovered with SINDy, consistent with predictions from linearised collisionless
dynamics. In this case, two distinct waves wrapping at pattern speeds $\Omega
\pm \kappa/m$ emerge. For large impacts, we empirically discovered a non-linear
system of equations, representing a novel formulation for the dynamics of
tidally induced spiral arms. For both cases, these equations describe wave
properties like amplitude and pattern speed, and their shape and temporal
evolution in different phase-space projections. We fit the Gaia $L_Z-V_R$ waves
with the linear model, providing a reasonable fit and plausible parameters for
the Sgr passage. However, the predicted amplitude ratio of the two waves is
inconsistent with observations, supporting a more complex origin for this
feature (e.g. multiple passages, bar, spiral arms). We merge data-driven
discovery with theory to create simple, accurate models of tidal spiral arms
that match simulations and provide a simple tool to fit Gaia and external
galaxy data. This methodology could be extended to model complex phenomena like
self-gravity and dynamical friction. (ABR)

### [3] [Characterizing Density and Gravitational Potential Fluctuations of the Interstellar Medium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17387)
*Shaunak Modak,Eve C. Ostriker,Chris Hamilton,Scott Tremaine*

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过高分辨率磁流体动力学模拟定量表征了星际介质（ISM）的气体密度，揭示了其表面密度波动的统计特性及其对星系动力学的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 星际介质（ISM）的亚结构对恒星形成与反馈的关联至关重要，并能显著扰动恒星轨道，在星系动力学和演化中起核心作用。当前对附近星系气体和尘埃发射的观测已解析到约10pc尺度的结构，需要与之匹配的理论模型。

Data: 研究使用了高分辨率磁流体动力学（MHD）模拟数据，覆盖pc到kpc尺度。

Method: 采用TIGRESS-NCR框架，包括剪切星系旋转、自洽的恒星形成与反馈、非平衡化学与冷却，并对表面密度波动场的一点和两点统计特性拟合简单解析模型。

Result: 研究发现，在太阳邻域和星系内部条件下，表面密度波动服从对数正态分布，其功率谱指数分别约为-2.2和-2.8；结构的寿命由反馈和有效压力项共同决定；气体垂直结构可用指数和sech平方剖面的混合模型描述。

Abstract: Substructure in the interstellar medium (ISM) is crucial for establishing the
correlation between star formation and feedback and has the capacity to
significantly perturb stellar orbits, thus playing a central role in galaxy
dynamics and evolution. Contemporary surveys of gas and dust emission in nearby
galaxies resolve structure down to $\sim 10\,$pc scales, demanding theoretical
models of ISM substructure with matching fidelity. In this work, we address
this need by quantitatively characterizing the gas density in state-of-the-art
MHD simulations of disk galaxies that resolve pc to kpc scales. The TIGRESS-NCR
framework we employ includes sheared galactic rotation, self-consistent star
formation and feedback, and nonequilibrium chemistry and cooling. We fit simple
analytic models to the one-point spatial, two-point spatial, and two-point
spatio-temporal statistics of the surface density fluctuation field. We find
that for both solar neighborhood and inner-galaxy conditions, (i) the surface
density fluctuations follow a log-normal distribution, (ii) the linear and
logarithmic fluctuation power spectra are well-approximated as power laws with
indices of $\approx -2.2$ and $\approx -2.8$ respectively, and (iii) lifetimes
of structures at different scales are set by a combination of feedback and
effective pressure terms. Additionally, we find that the vertical structure of
the gas is well-modeled by a mixture of exponential and sech$^2$ profiles,
allowing us to link the surface density statistics to those of the volume
density and gravitational potential. We provide convenient parameterizations
for incorporating realistic ISM effects into stellar-dynamical studies and for
comparison with multi-wavelength observations.

### [4] [JWST reveals cosmic ray dominated chemistry in the local ULIRG IRAS 07251$-$0248](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17390)
*G. Speranza,M. Pereira-Santaella,M. Agúndez,E. González-Alfonso,I. García-Bernete,J. R. Goicoechea,M. Imanishi,D. Rigopoulou,M. G. Santa-Maria,N. Thatte*

**TL;DR**: 通过JWST/MIRI MRS光谱分析IRAS~07251$-$0248中分子离子和中性物质的吸收带，发现其源于温暖的膨胀气体壳层，并揭示了高宇宙射线电离率的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 研究分析了JWST/MIRI MRS光谱（4.9-27.9微米）中检测到的分子离子（HCO+、HCNH+、N2H+）和中性物质（HCN、HNC、HC3N）的吸收带，探讨了这些吸收带在超亮红外星系IRAS~07251$-$0248中的起源和性质。

Data: 使用了JWST/MIRI MRS光谱（4.9-27.9微米）的数据。

Method: 采用局部热平衡（LTE）激发模型，通过红外辐射泵浦解释吸收带的旋转温度范围。

Result: 发现分子吸收带相对于系统速度蓝移160 km/s，旋转温度范围为42至185 K，表明其源于温暖的膨胀气体壳层，且高宇宙射线电离率（log(ζH2/nH)在-19.1至-18.2之间）解释了分子离子的丰度。

Abstract: We analyze the ro-vibrational absorption bands of various molecular cations
(HCO$^+$, HCNH$^+$, and N$_2$H$^+$) and neutral species (HCN, HNC, and HC$_3$N)
detected in the JWST/MIRI MRS spectrum (4.9-27.9 $\mu$m) of the local ultra
luminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS~07251$-$0248. We find that the molecular
absorptions are blueshifted by 160 km s$^{-1}$ relative to the systemic
velocity of the target. Using local thermal equilibrium (LTE) excitation
models, we derive rotational temperatures ($T_{\rm rot}$) from 42 to 185 K for
these absorption bands. This range of measured $T_{\rm rot}$ can be explained
by infrared (IR) radiative pumping as a byproduct of the strength, effective
critical density, and opacity of each molecular band. Thus, these results
suggest that these absorptions originate in a warm expanding gas shell
($\dot{M}$$\sim$90-330 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$), which might be the base of the
larger scale cold molecular outflow detected in this source. Finally, the
elevated abundance of molecular cations (H$_3^+$, HCO$^+$, HCNH$^+$, and
N$_2$H$^+$) can be explained by a high cosmic ray ionization rate, with
log($\zeta_{\text{H}_2}$/n$_{\rm H}\, [\text{cm}^3 \text{s}^{-1}])$ in the
range of -19.1 to -18.2, consistent with a cosmic ray dominated chemistry as
predicted by chemical models.

**TL;DR**: 研究利用JWST/AURORA调查数据，通过分析巴耳默和帕邢线，揭示了24个红移z=1.5-4.4的恒星形成星系的星云衰减曲线和尘埃覆盖分数，提出了一种尘埃覆盖分数低于1的模型来解释观测结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域对高红移星系的尘埃分布和几何结构了解有限，尤其是尘埃覆盖分数对星云衰减曲线的影响。本文通过分析巴耳默和帕邢线的红移差异，揭示了尘埃几何结构的多样性。

Data: 使用了JWST/AURORA调查中24个红移z=1.5-4.4的恒星形成星系的多条巴耳默和帕邢线数据。

Method: 通过比较巴耳默和帕邢线的红移差异，推导星云衰减曲线和尘埃覆盖分数，并提出了一种尘埃覆盖分数低于1的模型。

Result: 研究发现星云衰减曲线的归一化值（Rv）范围广泛（3.2-16.4），尘埃覆盖分数（fcov）在0.6-1.0之间，表明尘埃几何结构的多样性可以通过低于1的尘埃覆盖分数来解释。

Abstract: We present the nebular attenuation curves and dust covering fractions for 24
redshift z=1.5-4.4 star-forming galaxies using multiple Balmer and Paschen
lines from the JWST/AURORA survey. Nebular reddening derived from Paschen lines
exceeds that from Balmer lines for at least half the galaxies in the sample
when assuming the commonly-adopted Galactic extinction curve, implying the
presence of optically-thick star formation. The nebular attenuation curves
exhibit a broad range of normalizations (Rv ~ 3.2-16.4). Motivated by the
offsets in reddening deduced from the Balmer and Paschen lines, and the high Rv
values for the individual nebular attenuation curves, both of which suggest
variations in the dust-stars geometry, we propose a model with a subunity dust
covering fraction (fcov). Fitting such a model to the HI recombination line
ratios indicates fcov ~ 0.6-1.0. The normalizations of the nebular attenuation
curves, Rv, are driven primarily by fcov and the mix of optically-thick and
thin OB associations. Thus, the diversity of nebular attenuation curves can be
accommodated by assuming dust grain properties similar to that of Milky Way
sightlines but with a subunity covering fraction of dust. Integrated
measurements of multiple Balmer and Paschen lines can be used to place novel
constraints on the dust covering fraction towards OB associations. These, in
turn, provide new avenues for exploring the role of dust and gas covering
fraction in a number of relevant aspects of high-redshift galaxies, including
the impact of stellar feedback on ISM porosity and the escape of Ly-alpha and
Lyman continuum radiation.

**TL;DR**: 通过建模PopIII星系的演化，提出新的诊断方法以增加JWST观测中的候选星系数量，并成功识别出9个候选星系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 观测第一代恒星宿主PopIII星系极具挑战性，现有候选星系主要通过显著的HeII发射和无金属线特征识别，但这一特征极为短暂。

Data: 使用JWST观测数据，特别是JADES调查中的候选星系。

Method: 采用本地校准的星系形成模型，自洽地跟踪第一代恒星引发的恒星形成和化学演化。

Result: 发现PopIII星系在自污染阶段可发射金属线，且高HeII发射可持续约20 Myrs，提出新的UV金属线诊断方法，并在JADES中识别出9个候选星系。

Abstract: Observing Population III (PopIII) galaxies, the hosts of first-generation
stars, remains challenging even with the JWST. The current few candidates have
been identified through the combination of a prominent HeII emission and the
absence of metal lines, a well-known but extremely brief signature of
metal-free systems. Here, we accurately model the evolution of the emission
from PopIII galaxies to increase the number of candidates in JWST observations.
To achieve this, we employ a locally calibrated galaxy-formation model that
self-consistently follows the star formation and chemical evolution initiated
by the first stars. We find that PopIII galaxies can emit metal lines in their
``self-polluted'' phase, while galaxies host only metal-free stars but the gas
has been chemically-enriched by the first supernovae. In this phase, PopIII
galaxies have $\rm [OIII]/H\beta \approx 1$, which opens the pool of candidates
to more easily detectable sources. We predict that the high HeII emission of
PopIII galaxies can last up to $\rm \approx 20 \, Myrs$ and that it is partly
maintained in the ``hybrid'' phase, when PopIII and PopII stars co-exist in the
host galaxy. We propose novel diagnostics involving UV metal lines to select
PopIII candidates in high-z JWST surveys. In JADES, we identify 9 candidate
galaxies with $>25\%$ of their stellar mass in metal-free stars, showcasing the
effectiveness of our method. Ultimately, the key to discovering PopIII galaxies
could be to catch them during their first episodes of chemical enrichment.

**TL;DR**: 本文通过157个高质量、均匀的Hβ反响映射活动星系核样本，验证了Hβ宽线区域半径-光度关系的标准化性，并发现其斜率比预期更平缓，且与爱丁顿比存在一定相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域缺乏高质量、均匀的Hβ反响映射活动星系核样本，且此前样本规模较小。本研究旨在通过扩大样本规模，验证Hβ宽线区域半径-光度关系的标准化性，并探讨其与爱丁顿比的关系。

Data: 使用了157个Hβ反响映射活动星系核（RM AGNs）的数据，覆盖红移范围0.00308至0.8429。

Method: 通过分析Hβ宽线区域半径-光度关系（R-L关系），结合六种空间平坦和非平坦宇宙学模型，验证样本的标准化性。

Result: 研究发现Hβ R-L关系的斜率（γ=0.428±0.025）比预期更平缓，且与爱丁顿比存在相关性；样本的标准化性在大多数宇宙学模型中与现有数据一致，但两种非平坦模型被其他数据排除。

Abstract: We present a high-quality, homogeneous sample of 157 H$\beta$
reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (RM AGNs) spanning redshifts
$0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$, which is approximately 3.8 times larger than the
previously available high-quality homogeneous sample. Using the broad-line
region radius$-$luminosity relation ($R-L$), which involves the broad H$\beta$
line time delay and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100\,\AA\,, we show that
the sample is standardizable by using six spatially flat and nonflat
cosmological models. The inferred cosmological model parameters are consistent
within 2$\sigma$ uncertainties with those from better established baryon
acoustic oscillation and Hubble parameter measurements, with the exception of
two nonflat models that are ruled out by other data. The $R-L$ relation slope
is found to be flatter ($\gamma=0.428 \pm 0.025$ in the flat $\Lambda$CDM
model) than the slope expected from a simple photoionization model as well as
the slope found previously for the smaller homogeneous sample. In addition, we
find a mild dependence of H$\beta$ $R-L$ relation parameters as well as its
intrinsic scatter on the Eddington ratio by comparing the $R-L$ relations for
low- and high-accreting equal-sized subsamples. A future analysis of a larger
homogeneous sample containing a broader range of luminosities and Eddington
ratios is necessary to confirm the standardizability of H$\beta$ AGNs.

**TL;DR**: 该研究通过七组宇宙流体动力学模拟，预测了28个类似银河系质量盘星系的热环星系介质的X射线发射特性，揭示了不同反馈机制对X射线表面亮度形态和热CGM运动学的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 目前对围绕大质量星系的热环星系介质（CGM）的物理性质知之甚少，下一代X射线观测将支持对热CGM的详细研究。

Data: 研究使用了28个类似银河系质量盘星系在z=0时的数据，来自七组宇宙流体动力学模拟，涵盖了广泛的星系反馈机制。

Method: 通过七组宇宙流体动力学模拟，结合不同的反馈机制（如AGN反馈和恒星反馈），预测了热CGM的X射线发射特性。

Result: 研究发现X射线表面亮度形态和热CGM运动学在不同模拟中差异显著，AGN反馈和恒星反馈分别产生不同的XSB结构和运动学特征，且宇宙射线物理对CGM温度有显著影响。

Abstract: Little is currently known about the physical properties of the hot
circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding massive galaxies. Next-generation X-ray
observatories will enable detailed studies of the hot CGM in emission. To
support these future efforts, we make predictions of the X-ray emission from
the hot CGM using a sample of 28 $\sim$Milky Way-mass disk galaxies at $z=0$
from seven cosmological hydrodynamical simulation suites incorporating a wide
range of galactic feedback prescriptions. The X-ray surface brightness (XSB)
morphology of the hot CGM varies significantly across simulations. XSB-enhanced
outflows and bubble-like structures are predicted in many galaxies simulated
with AGN feedback and in some stellar-feedback-only galaxies, while other
galaxies exhibit more isotropic XSB distributions at varying brightnesses.
Galaxies simulated without cosmic ray physics exhibit radial XSB profiles with
similar shapes ($\propto r^{-3}$ within $20-200$ kpc), with scatter about this
slope likely due to underlying feedback physics. The hot CGM kinematics also
differ substantially: velocity maps reveal signatures of bulk CGM rotation and
high-velocity biconical outflows, particularly in simulations incorporating AGN
feedback. Some stellar-feedback-only models also generate similar AGN-like
outflows, which we postulate is due to centrally-concentrated star formation.
Simulations featuring AGN feedback frequently produce extended temperature
enhancements in large-scale galactic outflows, while simulations incorporating
cosmic ray physics predict the coolest CGM due to pressure support being
provided by cosmic rays rather than hot CGM. Individually-resolved X-ray
emission lines further distinguish hot CGM phases, with lower-energy lines
(e.g., O VII) largely tracing volume-filling gas, and higher-energy lines
(e.g., Fe XVII) highlighting high-velocity feedback-driven outflows.

**TL;DR**: JWST发现早期宇宙中存在大量超大质量黑洞，并通过BRAHMA模拟研究了黑洞种子对M•-σ关系的影响，揭示了不同种子模型对黑洞-星系共演化的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 詹姆斯·韦伯太空望远镜（JWST）在早期宇宙（红移z约4-7）中发现大量超大质量黑洞（质量范围10^6-10^8太阳质量），这些黑洞的BH-恒星质量比高于本地星系，为研究黑洞与星系共演化的早期阶段提供了新视角。

Data: 使用BRAHMA模拟数据，模拟中采用了质量约10^5太阳质量的重种子黑洞，并系统性地改变了黑洞种子模型。

Method: 通过BRAHMA模拟，研究了不同黑洞种子模型对M•-σ关系的影响，分析了种子丰度的不同预测。

Result: 研究发现，不同种子模型会导致M•-σ关系在高红移（z>2）和低红移低σ（50-80 km/s）系统中归一化不同；宽松种子模型显示M•-σ关系随红移变化较小，而严格模型在高红移高σ（约100 km/s）系统中归一化较低，并向本地关系演化。此外，严格模型的M•-σ关系散射更大，因为许多黑洞无法显著增长超过种子质量。

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has identified a large population of
supermassive ($10^6$-$10^8~\mathrm{M}_\odot$) black holes (BHs) in the early
universe ($z \sim 4$-$7$). Current measurements suggest that many of these BHs
exhibit higher BH-to-stellar mass ratios than local populations, opening a new
window into the earliest stages of BH-galaxy coevolution and offering the
potential to place tight constraints on BH seeding and growth in the early
universe. In this work, we use the BRAHMA simulations to investigate the impact
of BH seeding on the $\mathrm{M_{\bullet}}-\sigma$ relation. These simulations
adopt heavy $\sim10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ seeds and systematically varied BH
seeding models, resulting in distinct predictions for seed abundances. We find
that different seed models lead to different normalizations of the
$\mathrm{M_{\bullet}}-\sigma$ relation at higher redshifts ($z > 2$) across all
$\sigma$, and at low redshift for systems with low $\sigma$ ($50~\mathrm{km\
s^{-1}} \lesssim \sigma \lesssim 80~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$). The most lenient
seed model also shows negligible evolution in the $\mathrm{M_{\bullet}}-\sigma$
relation across redshift, while more restrictive models have substantially
lower normalization on the $\mathrm{M_{\bullet}}-\sigma$ relation for high
$\sigma$ ($\sim 100~\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$) at high redshifts, and evolve upward
toward the local relation. We demonstrate that the
$\mathrm{M_{\bullet}}-\sigma$ evolution is a direct consequence of
merger-dominated BH growth in low mass galaxies ($\lesssim 10^9~M_{\odot}$) and
accretion dominated BH growth in high mass ($\gtrsim10^9~M_{\odot}$) galaxies.
Furthermore, the scatter in the $\mathrm{M_{\bullet}}-\sigma$ relation is
larger for the more restrictive models due to the inability of many BHs to grow
significantly beyond their seed mass.

Background: 当前研究领域关注玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚暗物质（BECDM）与重子物质的引力耦合，但对其具体动力学和观测特征的研究仍不充分。

Data: 研究使用了数值模拟数据，基于BECDM的涡旋解和随机分布的理想气体模型。

Method: 通过数值求解BECDM与理想气体（IG）的引力耦合方程组，模拟了不同初始条件下的气体动力学和分布。

Result: 研究发现，当理想气体质量主导且初始速度分散较低时，气体凝聚效率最高；强玻色子自相互作用可能导致涡旋不稳定，而涡旋会在气体中留下持久的环状密度特征。

Abstract: Our results demonstrate that vortex lines in Bose-Einstein Condensate Dark
Matter (BECDM) can act as gravitational seeds that induce the condensation of
baryonic matter, leading to localized gas accumulation even in the absence of
imposed symmetries or rotation. Our analysis is based on the numerical solution
of the system of equations for the BECDM gravitationally coupled to Euler
equations for a compressible ideal gas (IG) that we use as a model of baryonic
matter. Numerical simulations are constructed for various scenarios that start
with a vortex solution for the BECDM and a randomly distributed ideal gas, with
the aim of investigating whether the matter distribution and dynamics of the
vortex influences the dynamics and distribution of the gas. We find that the
gas condensation process is most efficient when the IG mass dominates over the
BECDM, and when the IG has low initial velocity dispersion. We also find that
strong bosonic self-interaction does not guarantee the vortex stability,
instead, it can trigger dynamical instabilities that disrupt both the vortex
structure and the surrounding gas. An interesting finding is that the vortex
drives a persistent morphological signature on the gas, often in the form of
ring-like features visible in projected density maps. These patterns survive
nonlinear evolution and may serve as indirect tracers of vortex structures in
BECDM halos, potentially offering a novel and testable observational probe of
the model.

Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays a crucial role in regulating material
and energy exchange between galaxies and their environments. The best means of
observing this medium is through absorption-line spectroscopy, but we have yet
to develop a consistent physical model that fully explains these results. Here
we investigate the impact of turbulence and non-equilibrium chemistry on the
properties of the CGM, using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that
include the impact of an ionizing background. Increasing turbulence enhances
small-scale density fluctuations, shifting the kinetic energy spectra from
Kolmogorov to Burgers scaling. This is indicative of shock-dominated
dissipation, which plays a critical role in driving carbon ionization and
shaping the multiphase structure of the medium. At the same time, the presence
of background radiation significantly alters the ionization balance, increasing
the prevalence of C\textsc{ii} and C\textsc{iv}. Thus, turbulence and the
background radiation have complementary roles: turbulence governs the spatial
distribution and facilitates the formation of ionized species, whereas the
background radiation modifies the overall ionization equilibrium, setting the
observed distribution of multiphase carbon.

**TL;DR**: 本研究通过JWST/NIRSpec和ALMA观测，分析了NGC6240中心2 kpc区域内分子和电离气体的运动学特征，发现大部分近红外线发射与恒星运动解耦，并揭示了双锥形风和南核外流的存在。


<details>

Background: NGC6240是一个经历极端反馈机制的星系，目前对其分子和电离气体运动学的研究仍存在不足，尤其是气体与恒星运动的解耦机制和反馈效应的具体表现。

Data: 研究使用了JWST/NIRSpec和ALMA的观测数据。

Method: 研究采用了一种新的光谱线拟合方法，用于分离旋转和非旋转气体成分，并特别针对NGC6240的极端反馈机制进行了优化。

Result: 研究发现约65%的Paα、H2和[FeII]线通量来自与恒星运动解耦的气体成分；揭示了双锥形风的存在，并发现南核外流与高H2/PAH比值相关，表明H2主要由激波激发。

Abstract: [Abridged] We present a multi-line study of the kinematics of the molecular
and ionised gas phases in the central 2 kpc of NGC6240, based on JWST/NIRSpec
and ALMA observations. We devised a new spectral-line fitting approach to
de-blend rotating and non-rotating gas components, which is better tailored to
the extreme feedback mechanisms at work in NGC6240. We find that ~65% of the
Pa$\alpha$, H$_2$, and [FeII] line fluxes within the NIRSpec field of view
arise from gas components that are kinematically decoupled from the stars. The
NIR H$_2$ lines show the most deviation from the stars, with peak emission
between the two rotating stellar structures. The PAH 3.3$\mu$m feature does not
follow the NIR H$_2$ morphology, indicating that the latter does not trace
PDRs. In the non-rotating gas components, we identify a biconical wind launched
from the northern AGN, expanding along the minor axis of stellar rotation. This
wind is dominated by ionised gas and, although it entrains some H$_2$, it does
not show a H$_2$/PAH enhancement, suggesting either high UV irradiation or
expansion along a relatively gas-free path. Furthermore, we find bright
non-rotating gas emission between the two AGN and around the southern AGN,
which we interpret as due to an outflow launched from the southern nucleus,
coinciding with the molecular outflow previously studied in cold
(sub-)millimeter tracers. The strong H$_2$/PAH enhancement measured in this
region, coextensive with high velocity redshifted gas ($v\sim900$ km s$^{-1}$),
suggests that the shocks responsible for the high H$_2$/PAH ratios are due to
the outflow rather than to the collision of media during the merger. Our
results show that the bulk of the NIR line emission in NGC6240 is decoupled
from the stars, and that most of the warm H$_2$ is shock-excited and embedded
in a powerful outflow, where it coexists with colder molecular gas.

Abstract: The gravothermal core collapse of self-interacting dark matter halos provides
a compelling mechanism for seeding supermassive black holes in the early
Universe. In this scenario, a small fraction of a halo, approximately $1\%$ of
its mass, collapses into a dense core, which could further evolve into a black
hole. We demonstrate that this process can account for the origin of JWST
little red dots (LRDs) observed at redshifts $z\sim4-11$, where black holes
with masses of $10^7{\rm\,M_\odot}$ can form within $500{\rm\,Myr}$ after the
formation of host halos with masses of $10^{9}{\rm\,M_\odot}$. Even if the
initial collapse region triggering general-relativistic instability has a mass
on the order of one solar mass, the resulting seed can grow into an
intermediate-mass black hole via Eddington accretion of baryonic gas.
Subsequently, it can continue to grow into a supermassive black hole through
dark Bondi accretion of dark matter particles. In this scenario, the majority
of the black hole's mass originates from dark matter accretion rather than
baryonic matter, naturally explaining the overmassive feature of LRDs.

Abstract: The interstellar medium of galaxies, with temperatures reaching several
million degrees, provides a pivotal perspective for understanding the physical
and chemical properties of star formation, galactic evolution, and their
associated feedback mechanisms. We use archival data from $Chandra$
observations to extract the diffuse X-ray emission from 23 nearby star-forming
galaxies and study its correlation with star formation activity in the central
region of these galaxies. The surface brightness profile of each galaxy
presents a sharp decrease in the central region of $\thicksim$0.3$-$2 kpc and
then varies slowly outside this range. Compared to the global relation between
the diffuse thermal X-ray luminosity from hot gas ($L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm
gas}$) and the star formation rate (SFR), we found a super-linear relation of
${\rm log}(L_{\rm 0.5-2\,keV}^{\rm gas} /{\rm erg\,s^{-1}})=1.34\,{\rm
log}({\rm SFR}/{M_{\rm \odot}}\,{\rm yr^{-1}})+40.15$ for the center of these
sample galaxies. This result suggests that more intense stellar feedback is
associated with stronger star formation activity in the central region of
star-forming galaxies, where more energy output from supernovae (SNe) and
stellar winds is converted into X-ray flux. Furthermore, the slope of the
$L_{\rm 0.5 - 2\,keV}^{\rm gas}$$-$SFR relation anticorrelates with spatial
scale in the galactic central region. This indicates that the characteristics
of central hot gas emission are gradually averaged over larger areas. The
diffuse X-ray luminosity also shows a good correlation with molecular gas,
stellar mass, and mid-plane pressure traced by the baryonic mass, although
these relations show relatively large scatter.

*Lewis McCallum,Kenneth Wood,Robert Benjamin,Dhanesh Krishnarao,Anna F. McLeod*

**TL;DR**: This study extends previous work on the local warm ionized medium by incorporating metals into simulations to predict emission lines and estimates a lower local Galactic star formation rate, suggesting a bursty star formation history.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The research builds on previous static photoionization simulations of the local interstellar medium, constrained by 3D dust maps, to include metals for predicting emission lines and explores the effects of supernova feedback and time-dependent metal ionization.

Data: The study uses 3D dust maps and observationally-derived simulations of the local photoionized interstellar medium.

Method: The authors employ static photoionization simulations and radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, including time-dependent metal ionization and supernova feedback, to predict emission lines and analyze the local star formation rate.

Result: The study predicts all-sky emission lines and estimates a local Galactic star formation rate of 370 solar masses per million years per square kiloparsec, four times lower than previous estimates, suggesting a bursty star formation history and highlighting the role of luminous O-stars in ionizing diffuse gas.

Abstract: This work is the continuation of a series attempting to characterize the
local warm ionized medium through both static and time dependent simulations.
We build upon our three dimensional, observationally-derived simulation of the
local photoionized interstellar medium - based on static photoionization
simulations constrained by 3D dust maps - to include metals required to predict
collisionally excited optical and infrared emission lines, providing the first
all-sky prediction of a series of lines including [SII] 6716$\mathring{A}$,
[NII] 6584$\mathring{A}$ and [OIII] 5007$\mathring{A}$. While these predictions
only include O-star photoionization under ionization equilibrium, we also carry
out a suite of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations including time-dependent
metal ionization and the effects of supernova feedback to highlight missing
features in our predicted skies. We use the simulations to estimate the very
local (1 $\rm kpc^{2}$) Galactic star formation rate, finding a rate of 370
$\rm M_{\odot}~Myr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}$ provides the best match between the
observationally-derived and ab-initio simulations. This is approximately a
factor of four lower than previous estimates for the star formation rate
required to support an observed layer of high-altitude diffuse ionized gas,
possibly suggesting a `bursty' star formation history in the region surrounding
the Sun. We also investigate the effects of O-star environments on their
ability to ionize large volumes of diffuse ionized gas, and find it is likely
ionized by a small number of luminous O-stars located in regions where the
leakage of their Lyman continuum photons can produce the vast volumes of
ionized gas observed in the midplane and at high galactic altitudes.

Background: 银河厚盘中太阳型恒星在超太阳金属丰度下表现出未解释的钠富集现象，目前的研究尚未明确其来源。

Data: 使用了GALAH数据中银河厚盘太阳型恒星的[Na/Fe]和[Fe/H]数据。

Method: 采用OMEGA+银河化学演化代码，测试了四种核合成来源（核心坍缩超新星、渐近巨星分支恒星和Ia型超新星）对钠富集的贡献。

Result: 研究发现Ia型超新星爆炸模型对钠富集影响较小，现有化学演化模型无法解释观测到的钠富集现象，表明可能存在Ia型超新星的“欠污染效应”。

Abstract: We recently identified an upturn in [Na/Fe] for the population of Solar-type
stars in the Galactic thick disc ($-0.3 < [\mathrm{Fe/H}] < +0.3$ dex) at
super-Solar metallicity in GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) data. Here,
we investigate the cause of this unexplained Na enrichment between ([Fe/H]
$\sim 0 - 0.6$ dex) using the OMEGA$+$ galactic chemical evolution code. We
investigate the increase of [Na/Fe] with four combinations of nucleosynthetic
yields from the literature, with source contributions from core-collapse
supernovae, asymptotic giant branch stars, and Type Ia supernovae. We focus on
two possible causes for the Na-enhancement: the "metallicity effect" resulting
from core-collapse supernovae at super-Solar metallicity and the contribution
of metal-rich AGB stars. We adopt two sets of Type Ia supernova yields with one
model assuming only Chandrasekhar-mass explosions, and another assuming only
sub-Chandrasekhar-mass explosions. We find that the assumed Type Ia explosion
has little effect on the [Na/Fe] Galactic chemical evolution modelling, and all
Galactic chemical evolution models tested fail to reproduce the observed
[\mathrm{Na/Fe}] enrichment in the young thick disc population at super-Solar
metallicities. Our study indicates a possible "under-pollution effect" by SNe
Ia, which are the dominant producers of iron, in the Galactic disc's Solar-type
star population. These findings provide a step forward toward understanding the
origin of the unexplained sodium enrichment at super-Solar metallicities in the
Galactic disc.

Background: 星系结构的准确分解（如核球和盘）对于理解星系形成和演化至关重要，尤其是在高红移区域，星系通常较为致密且暗弱。

Method: 通过模拟具有核球+盘结构的星系，分别评估了单Sérsic和双Sérsic模型的拟合效果，并利用贝叶斯信息准则比较了两种模型的适用性。

Result: 研究发现单Sérsic模型可以恢复总星等（误差在0.5星等内）和大小（误差在0.2 dex内），而双Sérsic模型在恢复核球和盘的星等及有效半径方面具有类似精度；信噪比超过10时，模型参数可可靠复现。

Abstract: Characterizing and accurately decomposing galaxies into structural
components, such as bulges and disks, is essential for understanding galaxy
formation and evolution, particularly at high redshift, where galaxies are
compact and faint. Leveraging the unparalleled resolution and sensitivity of
JWST and imaging data from CEERs program, we simulate galaxies with bulge+disk
components and assess the effectiveness of single and double S\'ersic model
fittings, respectively. We first evaluate the performance of single S\'ersic
fits, and find it can recover total magnitudes (i.e., within 0.5 mag), and size
(i.e., within 0.2 dex), down to 27 mag. The features that emerged in the
residual map can properly reflect the underlying two-component structures. We
also show that S\'ersic indices can serve as proxies for the bulge-to-total
flux ratio (B/T). For double S\'ersic models, we find comparable accuracy in
recovering bulge and disk magnitudes (i.e., within 0.5 mag), and effective
radius (i.e., within 0.2 dex), down to 26 mag. To quantitatively determine
whether a double S\'ersic model better describes our two-component systems
compared to a single S\'ersic profile, we evaluate the Bayesian Information
Criterion for both model configurations. To extend the applicability of our
results to other NIRCam programs, we evaluate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
of the simulated galaxies and find that model parameters are reliably
reproduced when the SNR exceeds 10. Our work demonstrates the detailed
morphological measurement uncertainties using single and double S\'ersic
models, which provides an essential reference for future JWST/NIRCam-based
morphological studies, especially for high-redshift galaxies.

Background: 宽线活动星系核（BLAGNs）通常具有来自中心宽发射线区（BLRs）和窄发射线区（NLRs）的强发射线，但缺乏中心BLRs的类星体已被发现，而缺乏中心NLRs的BLAGNs仍是一个未解决的问题。

Result: 研究发现SDSS J1251+0613缺乏中心NLRs，提出了一种新的BLAGNs子类，并推测NLRs的演化可能与径向外流有关。

Abstract: Strong both broad and narrow emission lines from central broad emission line
regions (BLRs) and narrow emission line regions (NLRs) are fundamental
spectroscopic characteristics of broad line Active Galactic Nuclei (BLAGNs).
Lack of central BLRs leads to the identified true Type-2 AGNs without central
hidden BLRs, providing clues on formation/suppression of AGN BLRs. Whether were
there BLAGNs with lack of central NLRs is still an open question. Here, in the
blue quasar SDSS J1251+0613, both blue continuum emissions and broad emission
lines can be clearly detected in its SDSS spectrum, however there are no
apparently detected narrow emission lines in the optical/NUV bands, leading to
no central normal NLRs in the blue quasar SDSS J1251+0613. In order to explain
the lack of NLRs, evolving NLRs is proposed that the radial outflows are
carrying materials from BLRs to NLRs and the current narrow line emission
materials are lying closer to the outer side of central BLRs in SDSS
J1521+0613. The results in this manuscript can indicate a new unique subclass
of BLAGNs, the BLAGNs without central normal NLRs, which will provide potential
clues on physical origin/evolution of AGN NLRs.

<details>

Background: 星系盘的明亮内部区域通常具有指数径向光度分布和恒星表面密度分布，但其外围区域常表现出断裂轮廓（下弯型或上弯型）。近期欧几里得望远镜的观测显示，在英仙座星系团中下弯型断裂较少见，这与之前在室女座星系团的发现一致。

Abstract: Galactic discs are known to have exponential radial profiles in luminosity
and stellar surface density in their bright inner regions. Nonetheless, their
faint outer regions often display a break, with either a down-bending or an
up-bending profile. Recent Euclid Early Release Observations show that
down-bending breaks are scarce in the Perseus cluster, as already suspected in
Virgo. We use hydrodynamic simulations of disc galaxies interacting with a
Perseus-like cluster. We show that Type II profiles (down-bending) can be
rapidly eroded by the cluster tidal field on a 1 Gyr timescale, while Type III
(up-bending) and Type I (no break) profiles remain largely unaffected. Type II
profiles are eroded through dynamical processes, including tidal stirring of
stars by the cluster potential and triggering of star formation in the outer
disc. Our simulations show that observations of disc breaks across environments
and cosmic epochs are consistent with a coherent evolutionary picture. At high
redshift, JWST reveals early break structures in isolated environments. At low
redshift, field disc galaxies retain these breaks, while dense clusters, as
observed by Euclid in Perseus, show significant alterations. Our findings
support a scenario in which down-bending profiles result from internal
processes during early formation phases and are later modified by environmental
effects in clusters. This interpretation does not require additional mechanisms
such as ram-pressure stripping or star formation threshold variations to
explain the observed evolution of down-bending breaks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 椭圆星系周围的圆形弥散射电结构的形成机制尚不明确，J1218+1813的发现为研究这一问题提供了新的机会。

Data: VLA FIRST巡天数据（1400 MHz）、VLA C-configuration在L、C和X波段的数据、uGMRT在波段3（250-500 MHz）、波段4（550-850 MHz）和波段5（1000-1460 MHz）的数据。

Method: 多波段射电观测（VLA和uGMRT）、光谱分析、中央宿主星系的光谱数据分析。

Result: J1218+1813的核心频谱指数为0.8，表明其辐射主要由光学薄的同步辐射主导；外围频谱指数在1.1到1.8之间变化，最陡的值出现在弥散发射的边缘。宿主星系的黑洞质量为2.8±0.8×10^8 M⊙，恒星质量为2.9×10^11 M⊙，恒星年龄为8.58 Gyr。

Abstract: We report the discovery of J1218+1813, a circular diffuse radio source
detected in the Very Large Array (VLA) FIRST survey at 1400 MHz. The source has
an angular diameter of approximately one arcminute, corresponding to a physical
size of ~180 kpc, and is associated with an elliptical galaxy with a redshift
of z = 0.139635. To investigate its nature, we conducted a comprehensive
multiwavelength analysis spanning both high and low radio frequencies,
utilizing the VLA in C-configuration at L, C and X bands, along with the
upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at bands 3 (250-500 MHz), 4
(550-850 MHz), and 5 (1000-1460 MHz). A spectral study based on these
multiwavelength observations reveals that the core of J1218+1813 exhibits a
steep spectral index of 0.8, indicating that the emission is dominated by
optically thin synchrotron radiation. The spectral index varies between 1.1 and
1.8, from the inner to the outer structure, with the steepest values observed
at the periphery of the diffuse emission. An optical analysis of the central
host galaxy using spectroscopic data is also performed. The estimated black
hole mass is $2.8 \pm 0.8 \times 10^{8}$ M${_\odot}$, while the host galaxy has
a stellar mass of 2.9 $\times$ 10$^{11}$ M${_\odot}$ and a stellar age of 8.58
Gyr. The identification of J1218+1813 is particularly significant because it
provides insight into the mechanisms responsible for the formation of circular
diffuse radio structures surrounded by an elliptical galaxy. Potential
formation scenarios for J1218+1813 are discussed in this paper.

Abstract: Open clusters have long been used as tracers of Galactic structure. However,
without a selection function to describe the completeness of the cluster
census, it is difficult to quantitatively interpret their distribution. We
create a method to empirically determine the selection function of a Galactic
cluster catalogue. We test it by investigating the completeness of the cluster
census in the outer Milky Way, where old and young clusters exhibit different
spatial distributions. We develop a method to generate realistic mock clusters
as a function of their parameters, in addition to accounting for Gaia's
selection function and astrometric errors. We then inject mock clusters into
Gaia DR3 data, and attempt to recover them in a blind search using HDBSCAN. We
find that the main parameters influencing cluster detectability are mass,
extinction, and distance. Age also plays an important role, making older
clusters harder to detect due to their fainter luminosity function. High proper
motions also improve detectability. After correcting for these selection
effects, we find that old clusters are $2.97\pm0.11$ times more common at a
Galactocentric radius of 13~kpc than in the solar neighbourhood -- despite
positive detection biases in their favour, such as hotter orbits or a higher
scale height. The larger fraction of older clusters in the outer Galaxy cannot
be explained by an observational bias, and must be a physical property of the
Milky Way: young outer-disc clusters are not forming in the outer Galaxy, or at
least not with sufficient masses to be identified as clusters in Gaia DR3. We
predict that in this region, more old clusters than young ones remain to be
discovered. The current presence of old, massive outer-disc clusters could be
explained by radial heating and migration, or alternatively by a lower cluster
destruction rate in the anticentre.

Abstract: We considered five galaxies in the MaNGA survey that show distinct azimuthal
asymmetry in the abundance, in the sense that in the inner part (more than half
of the optical radius, $R_{25}$) of each galaxy there is a sector-like region
where the oxygen abundances (O/H)_h are higher than the abundances (O/H)_l in
other sectors. M-11761-12705 is a massive galaxy with a stellar mass of
log(M_star/M_sun) = 11.6; the masses of four other galaxies are moderate: 10.1
< log($M_star/M_sun) < 10.4. Abundances within both high- and low-metallicity
regions show flat radial gradients. The histogram for the spaxel abundances
demonstrates two distinct peaks, the difference between the (O/H)_h and the
(O/H)_l abundances are of 0.06 - 0.08 dex. The high-metallicity regions are
located in the O/H - N/O diagram closer to the lower envelope of the band than
the low-metallicity regions. The abundance properties in the massive galaxy can
be explained by the low-metallicity gas infall onto the galaxy and subsequent
starburst in the diluted interstellar gas. For moderate-mass galaxies, the
higher oxygen abundance in the high-metallicity region and its shift towards
the lower envelope in the N/O -- O/H diagram compared to the low-metallicity
region can be explained in one of two ways: either the starburst in the
high-metallicity region occurred several dozens of Myr ago, or the star
formation in the galaxy is accompanied by galactic winds, and the region
evolved with the lower efficiency of the enriched galactic winds shows higher
metallicity. Two galaxies of our sample are members of galaxy pairs. However,
the asymmetry parameter, A, quantifying the asymmetry of a light distribution
across the galaxy, is above the canonical threshold (A = 0.35) between
non-interacting/interacting galaxies in the massive galaxy only.

### [23] [Dim cores of radio-bright AGN jets: VLBI and Gaia astrometry pinpoint different parsec-scale features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17769)
*A. V. Popkov,Y. Y. Kovalev,A. V. Plavin,L. Y. Petrov,I. N. Pashchenko*

**TL;DR**: 研究者利用VLBI和Gaia数据系统性地搜索了AGN中明亮喷流特征与核心位置显著偏移的罕见案例，发现了35个此类源，并探讨了其物理原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 大多数活动星系核（AGN）的最亮致密细节是其射电喷流的不透明核心，但少数源的明亮特征是与核心相距甚远的喷流特征，这类源此前难以发现。

Data: 使用了公开可用的多频率VLBI和Gaia数据。

Method: 通过比较VLBI和Gaia坐标的统计显著偏移，并结合VLBI图像中的主导特征向量，系统性地搜索这类源。

Result: 发现了35个源，其VLBI坐标与喷流明亮成分相关，而Gaia坐标对应喷流起源；这些源的射电核心亮度异常低，喷流成分亮度极高，可能是驻激波前沿。

Abstract: Astrometry with the very long baseline radio interferometry (VLBI) allows us
to determine the position of a point close to the brightest compact detail of
the source at milliarcsecond scales. For most active galactic nuclei (AGNs),
this compact detail is the opaque core of the radio jet. Rare cases of sources
whose brightest detail is not the core but a prominent jet feature parsecs away
from the core have been reported, but such sources remained elusive. In this
work, we use a novel method for a systematic search of these sources. We
scrutinize the AGNs for which the offset between their coordinates determined
with VLBI and Gaia is statistically significant and coincides with the vector
between two dominant features in their VLBI images, using publicly available
archival multi-frequency data. We find 35 sources whose VLBI coordinates are
associated with a bright component of their jet separated by several to tens of
mas from the radio core. Their Gaia coordinates, in turn, correspond to the jet
origin and are close to the radio jet core. The previously published jet
directions of most of them must be reversed. These sources exhibit atypically
low brightness temperatures of the radio cores, down to 10^9 K in the host
galaxy frame, and, at the same time, extreme brightness of the dominating jet
components. We argue that these bright components are standing shock fronts and
discuss possible physical reasons for the low core brightness, such as
ineffective particle heating, atypical absorption, or differential Doppler
boosting.

**TL;DR**: 研究证实了蟹状星云中X射线通量与光子指数之间的负相关性，并发现这种相关性在硬波段比软波段更强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 蟹状星云中X射线通量与光子指数之间的反相关性是近期报道的现象，但其机制尚不明确。

Data: 使用了RXTE/PCA（3 - 50 keV）、RXTE/HEXTE（20 - 100 keV）和NuSTAR（3 - 78 keV）的存档观测数据。

Method: 从软波段（3 - 10 keV）和硬波段（10 - 50 keV、10 - 78 keV、20 - 100 keV）提取光谱，并用吸收幂律模型进行拟合。

Result: 在所有仪器和能量范围内，确认了X射线通量与光子指数之间存在持续的负相关性（高通量时谱更硬），且这种相关性在硬波段更强，与脉冲星风云中磁场变化调制的同步辐射一致。

Abstract: We present a systematic study of the recently reported anti-correlation
between X-ray flux and photon index ($\Gamma$) in the Crab Nebula, using
archival RXTE/PCA (3 - 50 keV), RXTE/HEXTE (20 - 100 keV), and NuSTAR (3 - 78
keV) observations. Spectra were extracted in soft (3 - 10 keV) and hard bands
(10 - 50 keV, 10 - 78 keV, 20 - 100 keV) and fitted with an absorbed power-law
model. Across all instruments and energy ranges, we confirm the existence of a
persistent negative correlation -- harder spectra at higher flux levels. The
correlation is stronger in the hard bands compared to the soft bands. This is
consistent with synchrotron emission modulated by magnetic field variations in
the pulsar wind nebula.

**TL;DR**: 利用VLBA对JWST北黄极时域场进行4.8 GHz观测，发现12个射电源显示非热AGN活动，并探讨了AGN与恒星形成对射电辐射的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: JWST北黄极时域场（TDF）的射电源研究旨在理解AGN活动与恒星形成的关系，现有研究认为射电宁静AGN的射电辐射主要由恒星形成驱动。

Data: 使用VLBA和VLA观测数据，覆盖106个射电源，其中12个被VLBA检测到。

Method: 通过VLBA的高分辨率（4 mas）和高灵敏度（3.3 μJy rms）观测，结合VLA数据，分析射电源的物理特性。

Result: 发现12个射电源显示非热AGN活动，AGN驱动的射电辐射贡献显著，且JWST/NIRCam数据支持早期型星系主导的AGN活动。

Abstract: We present initial results from the 4.8 GHz Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA)
survey of the JWST North Ecliptic Pole Time-Domain Field (TDF). From 106 radio
sources found in the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations in the TDF,
we detected 12 sources (11% detection rate) at 3.3 $\mu$Jy rms sensitivity and
4 mas resolution. Most detections exhibit pc-scale emission (less than 40 pc)
with high VLBA/VLA flux density ratios and brightness temperatures exceeding
10$^5$ K, confirming non-thermal AGN activity. Spectral indices ($>$ -0.5)
correlate with higher VLBA/VLA flux ratios, consistent with synchrotron
emission from AGN coronae or jets. In the majority of our sources star
formation contributes less than 50% of the total VLBA radio emission, with a
few cases where the emission is almost entirely AGN-driven. Although the radio
emission from radio quiet AGN is thought to be primarily driven by star
formation, our VLBA observations confirm that there is also often a
contribution at various levels from black hole driven AGN. Eight VLBA
detections have JWST/NIRCam counterparts, predominantly early-type,
bulge-dominated galaxies, which we use to get an estimate of the redshift and
star formation rate (SFR). WISE colors indicate that VLBA detections are either
AGN or intermediate-disk-dominated systems, while VLBA non-detections
correspond to extended, star-forming galaxies. We compare SFRs derived from
previous SCUBA-2 850 $\mu$m observations with new JWST-based estimates, and
discuss the observed discrepancies, highlighting JWST's improved capability to
disentangle AGN activity from star formation.

**TL;DR**: 通过结合ACT DR5的CMB温度图和DECaLS DR9的大尺度结构成像数据，研究kSZ效应和斑块屏蔽效应，发现斑块屏蔽信号受CMB透镜效应主导，并给出了DESI LRG样本的光学深度上限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 宇宙微波背景（CMB）的次级各向异性提供了丰富的天体物理和宇宙学信息，但目前对kSZ效应和斑块屏蔽效应的研究仍存在不足，尤其是在光学深度和透镜效应的影响方面。

Data: 使用了Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR5的CMB温度图和Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DECaLS DR9)的大尺度结构成像数据。

Method: 通过堆叠分析Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs)的轮廓，结合N体模拟和流体模拟，研究了kSZ效应和斑块屏蔽效应，并采用补偿孔径光度法（CAP）和高通滤波器进行信号提取。

Result: 检测到7.2σ的kSZ信号和4.1σ的斑块屏蔽信号，后者受CMB透镜效应主导；给出了DESI LRG样本的光学深度上限τ < 2.5×10⁻⁴；发现两种效应测量的光学深度信号一致，并观察到DESI LRGs周围存在额外的重子反馈。

Abstract: The secondary anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide a
wealth of astrophysical and cosmological information. Pairing measurements of
the CMB temperature map obtained by DR5 of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope
(ACT) with the large-scale structure imaging survey conducted by the Dark
Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, DECaLS DR9, we investigate two effects that
are sensitive to the gas density $\tau$: kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) and
`patchy screening' (also known as `anisotropic screening'). In particular, we
measure the stacked profiles around Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) at a mean
redshift of $z \approx 0.7$. We detect the kSZ signal at 7.2$\sigma$, and we
find a signal at $\sim 4.1\sigma$ for the patchy screening estimator, which is
in excess relative to the kSZ signal. We attribute this excess to contamination
from CMB lensing. We demonstrate the effect of lensing using $N$-body
simulations, and we show that the screening signal is dominated by it.
Accounting for lensing, our measurement places a 95\% upper bound on the
optical depth of the Extended DESI LRG sample of $\tau <$ 2.5 $10^{-4}$ for a
mean value of the sample of $\tau \approx$ 1.6 $10^{-4}$. Furthermore, via
hydro simulations, we show that the underlying optical depth signal measured by
both effects (after removing the CMB lensing contribution) is in perfect
agreement when adopting either a Compensated Aperture Photometry (CAP) filter
or a high-pass filter. Consistent with previous measurements, we see evidence
for excess baryonic feedback around DESI LRGs in the patchy screening
measurement. Provided both effects are measured with high signal-to-noise, one
can measure the amplitude ratio between them, which is proportional to the
root-mean-square velocity of the host halo sample, and place constraints on
velocity-sensitive models such as modified gravity and phantom dark energy.

### [27] [Flash Ionization of the Early Universe by Pop III.1 Supermassive Stars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18490)

**TL;DR**: The study explores the implications of Pop III.1 theory for SMBH formation on the CMB scattering optical depth, suggesting a combined contribution that may resolve issues in ΛCDM cosmology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: The Pop III.1 theory predicts early universe ionization by supermassive stars at redshifts z∼20-30, followed by recombination, impacting the cosmic microwave background (CMB) scattering optical depth.

Data: The study uses theoretical predictions related to the Pop III.1 theory and contributions from standard galaxy populations at z≲10.

Method: The research involves analyzing the implications of early universe ionization on the CMB scattering optical depth, combining contributions from Pop III.1 and standard galaxy populations.

Result: The study finds a total CMB scattering optical depth of τ≃0.10, which may help resolve issues in ΛCDM cosmology related to negative neutrino masses and dynamical dark energy.

Abstract: The Pop III.1 theory for supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation predicts
that a substantial fraction of the early universe was ionized by supermassive
stars at redshifts $z\sim20-30$, an era we refer to as ``The Flash''. This is
followed by recombination to a mainly neutral state within a few tens of Myr.
Here we discuss the implication of this ionization for the scattering optical
depth of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), $\tau$. We find a fiducial
contribution of $\tau_{\rm PopIII.1}\sim0.04$. Combining this with the
contribution to reionization by standard galaxy populations at $z\lesssim 10$
with $\tau_{\rm gal}\simeq0.06$, yields a total of $\tau\simeq0.10$. As noted
recently by several authors, such a value can help resolve apparent
``problems'' faced by $\Lambda$CDM of negative neutrino masses and dynamical
dark energy that have been implied by recent Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation
(BAO) results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI).

Background: 极贫金属恒星的研究对于理解早期宇宙的化学演化具有重要意义，但目前对这类恒星的高分辨率光谱分析仍较为有限。

Data: 使用了Subaru/HDS高分辨率光谱仪获取的四颗极贫金属拐点恒星的光谱数据。

Method: 通过高分辨率光谱分析技术测定了Li、C、Mg、Ca、Sr和Ba的丰度及上限。

Result: 研究发现四颗恒星的金属丰度范围在[Fe/H] = -3.3至-4.4 dex之间，其中一颗恒星的锂丰度为Log(Li/H) = 2.1 ± 0.2；两颗恒星的[α/Fe]丰度较低；最贫金属恒星（[Fe/H] = -4.42 dex）的[Sr/Fe]丰度比高达0.9 dex，与HE 1327-2326类似，表明北半球高分辨率光谱仪可能发现更多超贫金属恒星。

Abstract: We present the analysis of four new extremely metal poor turn-off stars
thanks to high-resolution spectra obtained with the Subaru/HDS spectrograph. We
determined the abundances and upper limits of Li, C, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba.
Metallicities range from [Fe/H] = -3.3 to -4.4 dex. For one of the stars, we
measure the lithium abundance Log(Li/H) = 2.1 {\pm} 0.2. Two stars of the
sample have low [{\alpha}/Fe] abundances. The most metal-poor star of the
sample with [Fe/H] = -4.42 dex has a high [Sr/Fe] abundance ratio [Sr/Fe] = 0.9
dex, a high value also found in HE 1327-2326. This star is the second-most
iron-poor star observed with Subaru telescope, suggesting that more ultra
metal-poor stars could be discovered using high-resolution spectrographs in the
Northern Hemisphere.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 非线性电动力学（NED）与广义相对论的耦合是当前研究的热点之一，但现有研究在电磁场规则性和黑洞解的多样性方面存在不足。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Data: 本文未明确提及具体数据来源，但基于理论推导和数学模型。

Method: 采用非线性电动力学与广义相对论的最小耦合模型，通过数学推导得到带电球对称黑洞解。

Result: 研究发现，某些参数下黑洞解的所有NED场（电场和电磁场平方）在径向坐标的所有值上均规则；另一些参数下，NED场和Kretschmann标量在空间无限远处规则。此外，还得到了具有不同或相同渐近行为的解，且不违反弱能量条件。

Abstract: We consider non-linear electrodynamics (NED) minimally coupled to general
relativity. We derive novel electrically charged, spherically symmetric,
black-hole solutions having, for some set of parameters, all their NED fields
(the electric field and the square of the electromagnetic field) regular for
all values of the radial coordinate. For another set of parameters, the NED
fields and the Kretschmann scalar are regular as the radial coordinate runs
from one spatial infinity to another spatial infinity without the metric being
a wormhole. We obtain solutions that have two distinct or the same asymptotic
behaviors (two spatial infinities) with equal or unequal ADM masses and
solutions with always one horizon whatever the ratio of the electric charge to
mass. We comment on some regularity theorems and generalize them to
multi-valued NED Lagrangians. The derived regular solutions do not violate the
Weak Energy Condition.
