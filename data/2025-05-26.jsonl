Most observational works in dwarf\ngalaxies employ integral field unit data to investigate gas physics in the\nentire galaxy body.

We study\nthe only known HII region in the SagDIG dIrr, a metal-poor dwarf galaxy of the\nlocal universe, using VIMOS-IFU/VLT and EFOSC2/NTT archival data. We aim to\nprobe the structure of the gaseous nebulae to (i) give insights into the\nphysical processes shaping its gas dynamics, and (ii) relate these mechanisms\nto the low gas-phase metallicity content estimated with the direct method. The\nH$\\beta$ emission line map shows two clumps as a biconic-like structure aligned\nacross the same axis. The [OIII]$\\lambda$5007 map, on the other hand, shows a\nmore symmetric structure.

By comparing the gas structure with the stellar\npopulation in the same region, the young stellar population ($<700$ Myr) are\nfound closer to the edges of the biconic-like structure.

In addition,\nSagDIG is in line with the low-mass end of the MZR. The observed\nstratification, the distribution of young MS stars, and the metal-poor content\nof the HII region suggest that the evolution of SagDIG seems to be actively\nshaped by stellar feedback processes, likely as the result of extragalactic HII\nregions being subject to the same gas physics as HII regions of the Milky-Way."}

The environment plays a crucial role in galaxy evolution,\nparticularly for galaxies infalling into clusters. Accurately estimating the\ninfall times of galaxies from observations can significantly enhance our\nunderstanding of the environmental effects on galaxy evolution. Aims. This\npaper aims to evaluate existing methods for estimating infall times via the\n$R-V$ diagram, explore possible strategies to improve accuracy in estimating\ninfall times, and discuss fundamental limitations. Methods. We utilize a\nTNG300-1 simulation and construct the $R-V$ diagram that is directly comparable\nto the observations. Using the same dataset, we systematically compare four\ncommonly used methods, including the projected radii, caustic profiles, and two\ndiscrete methods. A simple linear partition is also considered as a reference.\nResults. Each method exhibits distinct characteristics. While the linear\npartition slightly outperforms other methods, all methods suffer from limited\naccuracy ($\\gtrsim 2.6$ Gyr), constrained by the intrinsic dispersion ($2.53$\nGyr) of infall times in the $R-V$ diagram. Given this limit, we explore two\npotential approaches that can improve accuracy: (1) the infall time dispersion\nis smaller in more dynamically relaxed clusters, and (2) employing two\nestimates of infall times instead of one reduces the dispersion to\n$\\lesssim1.5$ Gyr. We further demonstrate that the intrinsic dispersion\nprimarily arises from orbital overlap: galaxies in different orbital phases\noverlap with each other in the $R-V$ diagram and thus appear indistinguishable.\nConclusions. Orbital overlap fundamentally limits the accuracy of infall time\nestimation. The linear partition approach could be a simple and robust\nestimation."}

However, such moderate mass systems are\nsusceptible to being disrupted by the external tidal field of their host\ngalaxies, potentially limiting their effectiveness as GW sources. In this\nstudy, I investigate the formation of BBH mergers in tidally dissolving star\nclusters. This is achieved with a newly computed grid consisting of 95\nevolutionary model star clusters, where the clusters are subjected to a varying\nextent of tidal stripping. The cluster evolutions are computed with the direct\nN-body integrator NBODY7 that includes, among others, treatments for\npost-Newtonian (PN) effects in compact-binary members, mass loss due to stellar\nevolution, formation of stellar remnants, and tidal stripping. It is found that\neven strong tidal stripping does not quench the formation of a black hole (BH)\ncore inside a cluster or the formation of dynamical BBH mergers in the system.\nThe overall properties of BBH mergers, e.g., the form of the distribution of\nmerger delay time, primary mass, and mass ratio, and the redshift evolution of\nmerger rate are not significantly altered by the extent of tidal stripping of\nthe parent cluster population. Furthermore, even strongly tidally stripped\nclusters are capable of dynamically forming Gaia-BH-like detached\nBH--main-sequence-star binaries that escape into the galactic field.\nLimitations of the present study and potential future improvements are\ndiscussed."}

Submitted to The Astronomical Journal on 22 May\n  2025", "summary": "The Milky Way Backup Program (MWBP), a survey currently underway with the\nDark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) on the Nicholas U. Mayall 4-m\nTelescope, works at the margins of the DESI Main surveys to obtain spectra of\nmillions of additional stars from the Gaia catalog. Efficiently utilizing\ntwilight times (<18 deg) and poor weather conditions, the MWBP extends the\nrange of stellar sources studied to both brighter magnitudes and lower Galactic\nlatitude and declination than the stars studied in DESI's Main Milky Way\nSurvey. While the MWBP prioritizes candidate giant stars selected from the Gaia\ncatalog (using color and parallax criteria), it also includes an unbiased\nsample of bright stars (i.e., 11.2 < G < 16 mag) as well as fainter sources (to\nG < 19 mag). As of March 1, 2025, the survey had obtained spectra of ~7 million\nstars, approximately 1.2 million of which are included in the DESI Data Release\n1. The full survey, when completed, will cover an area of more than 21,000\nsquare degrees and include approximately 10 million Gaia sources, roughly equal\nto the number of stellar spectra obtained through the DESI Main Survey, while\nonly utilizing <9% of all DESI observing time."}

Complicating the Oort cloud evolution\nprocess is the fact that comets can be stripped from orbit due to perturbations\nfrom passing stars. We explore how a star's cluster escape time (t$_{ \\rm\nesc}$) and the time its Oort cloud reaches maximum mass (t$_{ \\rm max}$) affect\nthe Oort cloud's ability to survive via $N$-body simulations. In a 14\nM$_\\odot$/pc$^3$ cluster, we identify 50 stars of 1 M$_\\odot$ with a range of\nt$_{ \\rm esc}$ to host Oort clouds, each with 1000 comets at t$_{ \\rm max}$.\nFor each host, we consider Oort clouds that reach maximum mass 0, 50, and 250\nMyr after the cluster's formation. Each Oort cloud's evolution is simulated in\nthe cluster from t$_{ \\rm max}$ to t$_{ \\rm esc}$. Only a fraction of comets\ntend to remain in orbit, with this amount depending on t$_{ \\rm max}$ and t$_{\n\\rm esc}$. We observe that 12%, 22%, and 32% of Oort clouds with a t$_{ \\rm\nmax}$ of 0, 50 and 250 Myr retain >50% of their comets at t$_{ \\rm esc}$,\nrespectively. We find that the fraction of comets stripped has the\nrelationship, $\\rm f=m\\log_{10}(\\frac{t_{ \\rm esc}-t_{ \\rm max}}{Myr})$ where m\n= 0.32$\\pm$0.04, indicating that the longer the Oort cloud remains in the\ncluster, the more comets are stripped, with this fraction increasing\nlogarithmically at approximately the same rate for each t$_{ \\rm max}$."}

The normalised cumulative rank (NCR) method was used\nto compare the explosion sites of 10 events to the star-formation distributions\nof their host galaxies, and to the sites of different evolved massive stars.\nThe resulting sample mean value of NCR$_{\\mathrm{H}\\alpha} = 0.170 \\pm 0.076$\nis low, while the NCR$_{\\mathrm{NUV}}$ distribution is flat with a mean value\nof $0.488 \\pm 0.084$. The NCR distribution of SN 1994W-like events is\nconsistent with relatively low-mass red supergiants (RSGs) and, despite the\nsmall sample size, inconsistent with high-mass stars such as luminous blue\nvariables. To explain the nature of SN 1994W-like transients, interaction\nbetween an expanding ejecta and a relatively massive circumstellar medium is\nlikely required, with the latter possibly having been produced by a H envelope\nejection via a nuclear flash event, or a luminous red nova (LRN) from a stellar\nmerger; both channels are consistent with low-mass RSGs suggested by the NCR\nresults. In this context, we find the early $-26$ d spectrum from light curve\nmaximum of SN 2003G to share similarities to those of F8-type supergiant stars\nand LRNe. Finally, based on late-time HST imaging, we set the deepest limits\nfor the surviving precursor of SN 2011ht to $M_{\\mathrm{F438W}} > -3.8$ and\n$M_{\\mathrm{F555W}} > -4.0$ mag. This would exclude most supergiants as a\nnon-terminal progenitor, assuming that such a star is not completely obscured\nby newly formed dust."}
