We find that the\nmajority of stars in the tail are formed close to the galaxy disc at the\nbeginning of stripping. Most stars have ages that reflect outside-in stripping\n-- older stars are found at larger radii than younger stars. The velocities and\nmetallicities of stars indicate that ICM mixing both increases the velocity and\ndecreases the metallicity of star-forming gas, leading to faster, lower\nmetallicity stars at larger distances from the galaxies. However, not all stars\nfollow this simple model, even in the case of face-on stripping. Indeed, a\nconsiderable number (15--25 per cent) of tail stars are formed with negative\nvelocities, indicating the fallback of star-forming gas on to the galaxy.\nAlmost all of the tail stars formed within 20 kpc from the disc will eventually\nfall back on to the galaxy, and their contribution to the intracluster light is\nnegligible. The orbits of the stars formed in the tail result in an extended\n(and asymmetric in the case of W45) stellar distribution around the disc. Mock\nUV images reveal that the observed vertical distribution of its stars is not\nsignificantly broader than in an undisturbed galaxy, indicating that more stars\nwould need to form in the stripped tail than we find in our simulations to\nobservably impact the UV disc width of ram pressure stripped galaxies."}

We take pyrene as an\nexample PAH and investigate how different degrees of superhydrogenation affects\nthe applicability of the harmonic approximation and the role of temperature in\nIR spectra of PAHs. This is achieved by comparing theoretical IR spectra\ngenerated by classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental IR\nspectra obtained via gas-phase action spectroscopy which utilizes the Infrared\nMultiple Photon Dissociation (IRMPD). All simulations are accelerated by a\nmachine learning interatomic potential, in order to reach first principle\naccuracies while keeping low computational costs. We have found that the\nharmonic approximation with empirical scaling factors is able to reproduce\nexperimental band profile of pristine and partially superhydrogenated pyrene\ncations. However, a MD-based anharmonic treatment is mandatory in the case of\nfully superhydrogenated pyrene cation for matching theory and experiment. In\naddition, band shifts and broadenings as the temperature increases are\ninvestigated in detail. Those findings may aid in the interpretation of JWST\nobservations on the variations in band positions and widths of interstellar\ndust."}

However, the number of\nbinaries with known orbital parameters remains limited. Utilizing the\nLAMOST-MRS survey, we derived orbital solutions for 665 SB2 binaries by fitting\nthe radial velocities of 1119 SB2 systems with at least six observations,\nemploying a modified version of Thejoker optimized for SB2 binaries. To ensure\nthe reliability of the results, four selection criteria were applied: reduced\nchi-square, normalized mean absolute error, maximum phase gap, and RV\ndistribution metric. After applying these criteria, 665 reliable orbits were\nretained. Comparison with Kepler, TESS, and ZTF light curve data shows\nexcellent agreement, with discrepancies in some cases attributed to shorter\npulsation periods observed in light curves. Additionally, good consistency is\nfound between our periods and those of SB1 systems in Gaia data. These orbital\nsolutions contribute to understanding binary star evolution and the statistical\nproperties of binary populations."}
