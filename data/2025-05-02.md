  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 在宇宙历史的早期阶段，存在数十亿太阳质量的超大质量黑洞（SMBH）是一个挑战，而类星体的寿命估计可能因视线方向的遮蔽效应而被低估。

Data: 使用了来自甚大望远镜/多单元光谱探测器（VLT/MUSE）的观测数据，分析了六个红移z约6的类星体的扩展Lyα发射。

Method: 通过测量类星体周围扩展Lyα发射的光传播时间，独立估计了类星体的寿命。

Result: 研究发现类星体的独立寿命估计与基于邻近区大小的估计一致，但其中一个类星体的邻近区被吸收系统截断，导致估计差异。结果支持类星体的当前吸积阶段刚开始，挑战了SMBH增长模型。

Abstract: The existence of billion-solar-mass black holes hosted in luminous quasars
within the first gigayear of cosmic history poses a challenge to our
understanding of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. The problem is further
exacerbated by the very short quasar lifetimes of $t_{\rm Q}\lesssim 10^6$
years, as derived from the extent of their proximity zone (PZ) sizes observed
in the quasars' rest-UV spectra. However, the quasar lifetime estimates based
on the extents of the proximity zones may be underestimated, as time-variable
obscuration effects might have limited the quasars' emission along our
sightline in the past. In this work, we present independent quasar lifetime
measurements for six quasars at $z \sim 6$ leveraging the extended nebular
emission perpendicular to our line-of-sight. We use observations from the Very
Large Telescope/Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) to search for extended
Ly$\alpha$ emission in the circumgalactic medium around quasars with small
proximity zones and estimate their lifetimes as the light travel time between
the SMBH and the outer edge of the nebula. We find agreement between the
independent lifetime estimates. For one object we find a proximate absorption
system prematurely truncating the extent of the quasar's proximity zone, which
thus results in an expected discrepancy between the lifetime estimates. Our
results provide further evidence that the quasars' current accretion episode
has only recently begun, challenging our models of SMBH growth.

*O. L. Dors,C. B. Oliveira,M. V. Cardaci,G. F. Hägele,I. N. Morais,X. Ji,R. A. Riffel,R. Riffel,M. Mezcua,G. C. Almeida,P. C. Santos,M. S. Z. de Mellos*

**TL;DR**: 研究通过分析11个活动星系核的紫外和光学发射线数据，揭示了紫外碳线校准中(C/O)-Z关系的不适用性，并提出了新的关系以解决金属丰度估计的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 活动星系核窄线区的紫外发射线估计的金属丰度与光学发射线估计的结果存在差异，但其来源尚不清楚。

Data: 文献中收集了11个活动星系核的窄近紫外（1000 < λ < 2000 Å）和光学（3000 < λ < 7000 Å）发射线测量数据。

Method: 使用基于C43发射线比的半经验校准方法，并与电子温度直接测量法和光学发射线校准法进行比较，研究了电离参数、电子密度和碳丰度对差异的影响。

Result: 研究发现紫外碳线校准中假设的(C/O)-Z关系可能不适用于活动星系核，提出新的关系后，紫外数据与电子温度法的金属丰度估计结果一致。

Abstract: Metallicity ($Z$) estimates based on ultraviolet (UV) emission lines from the
narrow-line regions (NLRs) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been found to
differ from those derived from optical lines. However, the origin of this
discrepancy ($ZR$) remains poorly understood. To investigate the source of
$ZR$, we compiled from the literature the fluxes of narrow near-UV ($1000 <
\lambda(\angstrom) < 2000)$ and optical ($3000 < \lambda(\angstrom) < 7000)$
emission line measurements for a sample of 11 AGNs (9 at $z<0.4$ and 2 at
$z\sim2.4$). Metallicity values for our sample were derived using a
semi-empirical calibration based on the
$C43$=log[(\ion{C{iv}$\lambda$1549+\ion{C{iii}]$\lambda$1909)/\ion{He}{ii}$\lambda$1640]
emission-line ratio and compared with those obtained via direct measurement of
the electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$-method) and via calibrations based on
optical emission-lines. The source of the discrepancy was investigated in terms
of the ionization parameter ($U$), electron density ($N_{\rm e}$), and carbon
abundance (C/H). We found a weak correlation between $ZR$, $U$ and $N_{\rm e}$.
However, a moderate correlation was observed between $ZR$ and direct estimates
of C/H, suggesting that the previously assumed (C/O)-$Z$ relations in
photoionization models used to derive UV carbon-line calibrations may not be
valid for AGNs. By combining a large set of abundance estimates for local
star-forming regions with those of our AGN sample, we derived a new (C/O)-$Z$
relation. Comparisons between the results of photoionization models that assume
this new abundance relation and the UV observational data of our sample produce
$Z$ values derived from the $C43$ index that are consistent with those obtained
using the $T_{\rm e}$-method.

### [3] [Evidence for Core-Core Collision in Barnard 68](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00301)
*Dalei Li,Christian Henkel,Alexander Kraus,Xindi Tang,Willem Baan,Jarken Esimbek,Ke Wang,Gang Wu,Tie Liu,Andrej M. Sobolev,Jianjun Zhou,Yuxin He,Toktarkhan Komesh*

**TL;DR**: 通过Effelsberg 100米望远镜对Barnard 68的SO发射线观测，支持了其核心碰撞的动力学和化学证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: Barnard 68（B68）是研究恒星形成初始条件和化学过程的典型源，此前数值模拟表明其东南部子弹状结构正在撞击主核心。

Data: 使用Effelsberg 100米望远镜对SO（1_0-0_1）发射线在30 GHz的映射观测数据。

Method: 通过速度场和通道图分析SO发射线，并使用1D球形非LTE蒙特卡洛辐射传输RATRAN代码推导SO的径向丰度分布。

Result: 观测结果显示三个速度分量，主核心的旋转符合刚体旋转模型，子弹与主核心的速度差为0.4 km s^-1，SO丰度在碰撞界面增强，支持核心碰撞场景。

Abstract: The prestellar core Barnard 68 (B68) is a prototypical source to study the
initial conditions and chemical processes of star formation. A previous
numerical simulation suggested the southeastern bullet is impacting on the main
body of B68. In order to obtain more observational evidence, mapping
observations of the ground state SO ($1_0-0_1$) emission line at 30 GHz were
made with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope. Based on the velocity field and
channel maps derived from SO, three velocity components were clearly detected.
The velocity field of the main body indicates rotation and is well fitted by a
solid-body rotation model. The measured radial velocity difference between the
bullet and the main core is about 0.4 km s$^{-1}$, which is almost equal to the
velocity obtained by the previous numerical simulation. Therefore, the bullet
is most likely impacting onto the rotating main body of B68. A 1D spherical
non-LTE Monte-Carlo radiation transfer RATRAN code is performed to derive the
radial abundance profile of SO by analyzing the observed velocity-integrated
intensity. SO is depleted inside a 60$^{\prime\prime}$ (0.02 pc) radius from
the core. The abundance stays constant at 2.0$\times$10$^{-9}$ for radii larger
than 60$^{\prime\prime}$ from the center of the main core. The abundance is
enhanced at the interface of the bullet and the main core indicating that shock
waves were produced by the collision between the bullet and the main core. In
conclusion, based on the kinematical and chemical analysis, our observational
results support the previously proposed core-core collision scenario in B68.

### [4] [The Jackknife method as a new approach to validate strong lens mass models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00553)
*Shun Nishida,Masamune Oguri,Yoshinobu Fudamoto,Ayari Kitamura*

**TL;DR**: 本文提出了一种新的Jackknife方法，用于验证强透镜质量模型的有效性，特别是在星系团尺度上，并通过模拟和实际观测数据展示了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 强透镜分析中质量模型的准确性对于放大率和时间延迟等物理量的无偏预测至关重要，但多重图像的位置不确定性常需调整以考虑暗物质的复杂结构，这使得卡方值的解释变得困难。

Data: 使用了模拟数据和星系团MACS J0647.7+7015的实际观测数据。

Method: 引入了Jackknife方法，通过移除一个源的多重图像进行拟合，优化质量模型后计算被移除源的多重图像位置，并与观测位置进行定量比较。

Result: 研究发现Jackknife方法在简单模型模拟中表现有效，并展示了其在星系团MACS J0647.7+7015质量建模中的应用潜力，可用于验证物理量误差估计。

Abstract: The accuracy of a mass model in the strong lensing analysis is crucial for
unbiased predictions of physical quantities such as magnifications and time
delays. While the mass model is optimized by changing parameters of the mass
model to match predicted positions of multiple images with observations,
positional uncertainties of multiple images often need to be boosted to take
account of the complex structure of dark matter in lens objects, making the
interpretation of the chi-square value difficult. We introduce the Jackknife
method as a new method to validate strong lens mass models, specifically
focusing on cluster-scale mass modeling. In this approach, we remove multiple
images of a source from the fitting and optimize the mass model using multiple
images of the remaining sources. We then calculate the multiple images of the
removed source and quantitatively evaluate how well they match the observed
positions. We find that the Jackknife method performs effectively in
simulations using a simple model. We also demonstrate our method with mass
modeling of the galaxy cluster MACS J0647.7+7015. We discuss the potential of
using the Jackknife method to validate the error estimation of the physical
quantities by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo.

### [5] [Can We Probe Spacetime Non-commutativity Through Tidal Deformability of Compact Objects?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00498)
*Junting Peng,Yanbo Zhao,Antonino Marciano*

**TL;DR**: 研究了时空非对易性对致密天体潮汐形变的影响，并通过引力波观测探讨了探测非对易效应的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 当前研究领域关注时空非对易性对致密天体潮汐形变的影响，特别是通过引力波观测探测非对易效应的可能性。现有研究提出多种致密天体作为探测时空非对易性的候选对象，但本研究通过解析方法发现，对于表面无奇点的致密天体（如中子星和玻色星），其潮汐形变的非对易修正值在黑洞紧致极限下收敛为有限值，避免了在视界尺度上的无限增强。

Data: 研究中使用了中子星和玻色星的数据，考虑了多种不同模型。

Method: 基于德西特引力规范理论，对时空几何进行了非对易修正，并计算了这些修正对潮汐形变的影响。通过解析和数值计算，分析了非对易效应对引力波信号的印记。

Result: 研究发现，在黑洞紧致极限附近，主导阶的非对易修正对致密天体的潮汐形变起主要作用，但中子星和玻色星并非约束时空非对易性的可行候选对象。

Abstract: We investigate the impact of spacetime non-commutativity on the tidal
deformability of compact objects and explore the feasibility of detecting
non-commutative (NC) effects through gravitational wave (GW) observations. We
considered NC modifications to spacetime geometry based on de Sitter gauge
theory of gravity and calculate their impact on tidal deformability. While
several types of compact objects have been proposed as candidates for probing
spacetime non-commutativity, particularly at the horizon scales, our study
showed analytically that, for compact objects with non-singular metric at their
surface (such as neutron stars and boson stars), the NC correction to their
tidal deformability converge to a finite value at the black-hole-compactness
limit, eliminating infinite enhancement at the horizon scales. We then compute
the NC corrections for neutron stars and boson stars, considering several
different models, and analyze their imprints on the GW signals. By comparing
the results, we assess the scale of NC effects across different compactness
regimes and discuss the conditions under which these NC effects can be
amplified. While our findings suggest that the leading-order NC correction
dominates the tidal deformability of a compact object near the
black-hole-compactness limit, we demonstrate that neutron stars and boson stars
are not viable candidates to constrain spacetime non-commutativity, while
relying on the tidal deformability through GW observations.

### [6] [Reconstructing the Free-floating Planet Mass Function with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00092)
*William DeRocco,Matthew T. Penny,Samson A. Johnson,Peter McGill*

**TL;DR**: 本文研究了南希·格雷斯·罗曼太空望远镜在探测自由漂浮行星质量分布方面的潜力，并提出了通过群体统计推断改进现有估计的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 自由漂浮行星是银河系中最神秘的行星群体之一，尽管地面观测表明其数量庞大，但对其起源和人口统计知之甚少。

Data: 南希·格雷斯·罗曼太空望远镜的银河凸起时域调查预计将探测到数百颗自由漂浮行星。

Method: 通过群体统计推断方法重建自由漂浮行星的质量分布。

Result: 研究发现，罗曼望远镜将能够显著改进对地球质量以下自由漂浮行星丰度的估计，并区分不同的假设质量分布。

Abstract: Free-floating planets comprise one of the most enigmatic populations of
exoplanets in the Galaxy. Though ground-based observations point to a large
abundance of these worlds, little is known about their origins and
demographics. In the coming years, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's
Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey is expected to detect several hundred
free-floating planets, providing the first opportunity to characterize these
worlds at the population level. We present a first study of Roman's prospects
for reconstructing the mass distribution of free-floating planets through
population-level statistical inference. We find that depending on the true
underlying mass distribution of free-floating planets in the Galaxy, Roman will
be able to improve upon existing estimates of the abundance by orders of
magnitudes in the largely unexplored mass range below that of Earth. When
applied to Roman's observations, the methodology we present herein will be
capable of discriminating between different hypothesized mass distributions at
high statistical significance, opening a new window into the origins of these
rogue worlds.

### [7] [Bayesian Inference of Core Properties of Hybrid Stars from Future High-Precision Measurements of Their Radii](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00194)
*Bao-An Li,Xavier Grundler,Wen-Jie Xie,Nai-Bo Zhang*

**TL;DR**: 通过贝叶斯框架和元模型，研究高精度中子星半径数据如何更好地揭示中子星壳核过渡密度、强子-夸克相变密度及高密度物质状态方程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: 未来高精度的X射线和引力波观测预计能将中子星半径测量精度提高到0.1公里以内，为研究中子星核心超密物质的性质和状态方程提供前所未有的机会。

Data: 研究中使用了模拟的中子星半径数据，精度从1.0公里到0.1公里不等。

Method: 采用贝叶斯框架和元模型，结合已知的核物理和天体物理约束，分析中子星半径数据。

Result: 研究发现，壳核过渡密度几乎不受数据精度影响，而强子-夸克相变密度及其相关参数对先验范围敏感；高精度数据能更严格约束相变密度、夸克物质比例和高密度强子状态方程参数。

Abstract: Future high-precision X-ray and gravitational wave observations of neutron
stars (NSs) are expected to measure NS radii to better than $\sigma=0.1$ km
accuracy, providing unprecedented opportunities to extract novel information
about the nature and equation of state (EOS) of supradense matter in NS cores.
Within a Bayesian framework using a meta-model for NS EOS encapsulating a
first-order hadron-quark phase transition and satisfying all known constraints
from both nuclear physics and astrophysics, we investigate how NS radius data
with higher precision may better inform us about (1) the NS crust-core
transition density $\rho_{cc}$, (2) the hadron-quark transition density
$\rho_t$, quark matter fraction $F_{\rm{QM}}$ and its radius $R_{\rm{QM}}$, and
(3) high-density NS EOS parameters. Using fiducial NS radius data with mocked
precisions varying from $\sigma=1.0$ km to 0.1 km, we found (a) the most
probable crust-core transition density $\rho_{cc}$ and its 68\% confidence
boundaries are essentially unaffected by $\sigma$ especially for massive NSs;
(b) our answers to the questions (2) and (3) listed above depend sensitively on
the prior range of hadron-quark transition density $\rho_t$ assumed. Using its
fiducial range of $(1.0-6.0)\rho_0$, the posterior PDF($\rho_t$) has a major
peak around $(1.7-2.0)\rho_0$ that is sufficient but unnecessary in describing
all existing NS radius data, and a minor peak around $(3.0-5.0)\rho_0$
consistent with the indication about $\rho_t$ of recent Beam Energy Scan
Experiments at RHIC. Narrowing down the prior range of $\rho_t$ to
$(3.0-6.0)\rho_0$, NS radius data with smaller $\sigma$ can constrain more
stringently the posterior PDF($\rho_t$), $F_{\rm{QM}}$, $R_{\rm{QM}}$ and
several high-density hadronic EOS parameters.

### [8] [Multiple generation star formation in Cepheus Flare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00407)
*Fan Wang,Min Fang,Xiaoting Fu,Yang Su,Xuepeng Chen,Shiyu Zhang,Penghui Liu,Xiao-Long Wang,Haijun Tian,Wenyuan Cui,Zhongmu Li*

**TL;DR**: 通过分析Gaia DR3数据，研究扩展了年轻恒星移动群ASCC 127的成员至3,971颗恒星，揭示了其五个亚群与Cepheus Flare星形成区域的联系，并提出了反馈驱动的星形成历史。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Background: ASCC 127是一个年轻恒星移动群，现有研究对其成员数量和亚群结构的认识有限，且其与Cepheus Flare星形成区域的关联尚未充分探索。

Data: 使用了Gaia DR3数据。

Method: 通过运动学和距离标准对ASCC 127进行亚群划分，并结合尘埃和气体映射分析。

Result: 研究发现ASCC 127包含五个亚群，年龄范围15至32 Myr，揭示了与Cepheus Flare区域的四阶段星形成序列，并发现了一个可能由超新星反馈形成的空间空腔。

Abstract: We present an analysis of the young stellar moving group ASCC 127 using Gaia
DR3 data, significantly expanding its membership to 3,971 stars -- double the
number identified in previous studies. Using kinematic and distance criteria,
ASCC 127 is divided into five subgroups (Groups 1-5) with ages spanning from 15
to 32 Myr. Groups 1-5 are spatially linked to the Cepheus Flare star-forming
region, revealing potential evidence of four sequential star formation episodes
at approximately 32 Myr, 20 Myr, 15 Myr, and 7 Myr. Through dust and gas
mapping, we identify a spatial cavity extending several tens of parsecs, which
may have resulted from feedback processes such as supernovae associated with
earlier generations of stars in the region. This structure, along with the
larger Loop III feature, indicates that feedback from massive stars likely
influenced the interstellar medium (ISM). By integrating young stellar
populations with ISM studies, we provide a detailed picture of the
feedback-driven star formation history in the Cepheus Flare region.
