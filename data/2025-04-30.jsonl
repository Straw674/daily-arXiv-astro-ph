Disentangling their contributions is\nessential for understanding galaxy evolution and constructing accurate mass\nmodels of the MW. We analyze the time-dependent structure of MW-mass halos from\nzoomed cosmological-hydrodynamical simulations by decomposing their mass\ndistribution into spherical harmonic expansions. We find that the dipole\n($\\ell=1$) and quadrupole ($\\ell=2$) moments dominate the gravitational power\nspectrum, encoding key information about the halo's shape and its interaction\nwith the cosmic environment. While the dipole reflects transient perturbations\nfrom infalling satellites and damps on dynamical timescales, the quadrupole --\nlinked to the halo's triaxiality -- is a persistent feature. We show that the\nquadrupole's orientation aligns with the largest filaments, imprinting a\nlong-lived memory on the halo's morphology even in its inner regions ($\\sim30$\nkpc). At the virial radius, the quadrupole distortion can reach 1-2 times the\nspherical density, highlighting the importance of environment in shaping\nMW-mass halos. Using multivariate Singular Spectrum Analysis, we successfully\ndisentangle the effects of satellite mergers and filamentary accretion on\nquadrupole. We find that the quadrupolar response induced by LMC-mass\nsatellites has an order of magnitude larger gravitational power than in\nspherically symmetric MW models. This highlights the need for models that\nincorporate the MW's asymmetry and time-evolution, with direct consequences for\nobservable structures such as disk warps, the LMC-induced wake, and stellar\ntracers -- particularly in the era of precision astrometry."}

The\ninner disk displays a monotonic, homogeneous chemical evolution with little\ndispersion, while the outer disk shows little metallicity increase over the\npast 8 Gyr. The solar neighborhood appears as a mixture, not only due to\nstellar migration but also because the chemical evolution of the ISM in this\nintermediate region results from the mixing of gas from the inner and outer\ndisks.

This\nrelation exhibits small scatter, thus providing key constraints for models of\ngalaxy formation and evolution -- allowing us to map the distribution of dark\nmatter in galaxies -- as well as models of modified dynamics. However, it has\nonly been extensively studied in the very local Universe with largely\nheterogeneous samples. We present a new measurement of the RAR, utilising a\nhomogeneous, unbiased sample of H{\\sc i}-selected galaxies. We introduce a\nnovel approach of measuring resolved stellar masses using spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) fitting across 10 photometric bands to determine the\nresolved mass-to-light ratio, which we show is essential for measuring the\nacceleration due to baryons in the low-acceleration regime. We find that the\nstellar mass-to-light ratio varies across galaxies and radially, favouring\nlower mass-to-light ratios compared to previous studies. Our results reveal a\ntight RAR with a low-acceleration power-law slope of $\\sim 0.5$, consistent\nwith previous studies. Adopting a spatially varying mass-to-light ratio yields\nthe tightest RAR with an intrinsic scatter of only $0.045 \\pm 0.022$ dex.

Their key distinction lies\nin the 'viscous' timescale parameter - tied to the disk's stress and angular\nmomentum transport efficiency - which should be treated as a free parameter\nwhen modeling the disk evolution of transient events. We examine the\nimplications for QPE models by tracking the time evolution of disk properties\nsuch as mass surface density and accretion rate.

Data\n  available online at http://svocats.cab.inta-csic.es/gaiaagb/", "summary": "This paper describes the identification of Gaia counterparts of a sample of\noxygen-rich AGB stars with OH maser emission as a first step towards the\ncompilation of a general Gaia Catalogue of Galactic AGB stars. With this\ncatalogue, tests of evolutionary models for the AGB star population in the\nsolar neighbourhood will become feasible. We cross-matched AGB star candidates\nshowing OH maser emission with Gaia DR3 using a cross-match with AllWISE and\n2MASS as intermediate steps to avoid ambiguities. With the help of the Virtual\nObservatory, we retrieved photometric data from the near-ultraviolet to the\nfar-infrared and built spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the sources. The\nSEDs were fitted with theoretical models. The fit results, together with\ninformation from the literature, allowed us to clean the sample from non-AGB\nstars and to obtain bolometric fluxes for the AGB stars. Distances based on\nGaia parallaxes were used to derive the stellar luminosities. We identified\nunique Gaia counterparts for 1487 OH masers. Of these, 1172 had an unambiguous\nclassification as AGB stars; they make up the Gaia OH/IR star sample.\nParallaxes with relative errors $<$20\\% and astrometric excess noise $<$1.5 mas\nwere available for 222 OH/IR stars. We conclude that the study of the AGB\npopulation in the solar neighbourhood is limited by the obscuration by\ncircumstellar dust, as \\G\\ DR3 only provides parallaxes for a few of our\ncandidates. The location of the OH/IR stars matches that of LPV discovered by\n\\G\\ in the (BP$-$RP; G$_{abs}$) diagram, but the OH/IR star sample is biased\ntowards redder colours (BP$-$RP$>$4) mag and larger amplitudes ($>$1 mag in the\nG-band), which are typical for periodic large-amplitude Mira variables."}

Most theories of dust formation in SNe heavily rely only on SN\n1987A. In the last two years, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has enabled\nus to probe the dust evolution in decades-old SNe, such as SN 2004et, SN\n2005ip, and SN 1980K. In this paper, we present two decades of dust evolution\nin SN 2005af, combining early-time infrared observations with Spitzer Space\nTelescope and recent detections by JWST. We have used a chemical kinetic model\nof dust synthesis in SN ejecta to develop a template of dust evolution in SN\n2005af. Moreover, using this approach, for the first time, we have separately\nquantified the dust formed in the pre-explosion wind that survived after the\nexplosion, and the dust formed in the metal-rich SN ejecta post-explosion. We\nreport that in SN 2005af, predominantly carbon-rich dust is formed in the\nejecta, where the total mass of ejecta dust is about 0.02-0.03 Msun, while in\nthe circumstellar medium the amount of surviving oxygen-rich dust is\n0.001-0.004 Msun."}

In the $\\gamma$-ray band, multiple flaring\nepisodes were observed, with the strongest flare reaching a peak flux of\n$(5.60\\pm1.11)\\times10^{-7}\\:{\\rm photons\\:cm^{-2}\\:s^{-1}}$ on MJD 55869.03\n(04 November 2011). In the optical/UV band, the source was in an active state\nbetween MJD 57360 (04 December 2015) and 57960 (26 July 2017), during which the\nhighest flux of $(1.07\\pm0.02)\\times10^{-10}\\:{\\rm erg\\:cm^{-2}\\:s^{-1}}$ was\nobserved on MJD 57681.23 (20 October 2016). In the X-ray band, both the flux\nand spectral index exhibit variability. To investigate the origin of the\nbroadband emission from OJ 287, we systematically modeled 739\nquasi-simultaneous SEDs using a leptonic model that self-consistently accounts\nfor particle injection and cooling. This analysis is possible thanks to the\nrecent development of a surrogate neural-network-based model, trained on\nkinetic simulations. This innovative, time-resolved, neural network-based\napproach overcomes the limitations of traditional single-epoch SED modeling,\nenabling to explore the temporal evolution of key model parameters, such as the\nmagnetic field strength, Doppler factor, and electron injection distribution,\nacross different states of the source. We identified distinct emission states\ncharacterized by unique combinations of magnetic field $ B $, electron index $\np $, and Doppler boost $ \\delta $, associated to different underlying\nmechanisms such as varying acceleration processes (e.g., shocks, turbulence)\nand magnetic confinement. The analysis provides insights into the jet physics\nprocesses, including particle acceleration mechanisms and dynamic changes in\nthe jet structure."}

The results are: 1) the presence of relativistic protons has\na significant effect on the correlation of the light curves as the emerging\npair cascade prolongs flaring states at the highest energies; and 2) comparison\nof the theoretical light curves with existing VHE gamma-ray data shows that\nboth leptonic and hadronic models can only partially reproduce the data."}
