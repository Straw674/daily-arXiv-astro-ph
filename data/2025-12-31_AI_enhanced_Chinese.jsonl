To reduce cross-dataset systematics, we define the green valley internally using $(g-r)$ percentiles: for galaxies with $\\log_{10}(M_\\star/M_\\odot)>10$, we select the 75th-95th percentiles (SDSS observed-frame fibre colours; simulations rest-frame synthetic colours within 30 kpc). SDSS hosts are linked to the MPA-JHU catalogue for stellar masses and aperture-corrected total SFRs. TNG green-valley centrals are almost entirely quenched, with a sharp pile-up at the imposed SFR floor and median $\\log_{10}\\mathrm{sSFR}\\simeq-14.85$ ($\\sim$3.5 dex below SDSS). EAGLE instead produces a broad, continuous distribution with median $\\log_{10}\\mathrm{sSFR}\\simeq-11.71$ and substantial overlap with SDSS, robust to varying the lower percentile between 60 and 90. At fixed mass, TNG yields higher green-valley occupancy fractions (reaching $\\gtrsim60$ per cent near $M_\\star\\sim10^{11}M_\\odot$) than EAGLE (20-40 per cent). A simple forward model of nebular line ratios places EAGLE analogues across the star-forming and composite loci in the BPT plane, while TNG analogues concentrate in a LINER-like, low-sSFR regime. We infer that TNG's kinetic mode drives an efficient, near-binary shutdown of star formation, whereas EAGLE's stochastic thermal feedback supports a slower decline more consistent with local AGN hosts.

Due to randomly triggered accretion events, the lifetime of the retriggered jet is not expected to have any connection to the time of quiescence between jets, yet we show that a correlation between the two quantities may exist, which we interpret as resulting from continued accretion through the quiescent jet phase. Despite continuous accretion, a jet is absent because its presence depends on a non-zero value of black hole spin, but accretion transitions the system from counter-rotation to corotation, and therefore through zero black hole spin where a jet cannot form. The time of jet quiescence depends on how long it takes to spin the black hole up again in corotation, which is longer for lower accretion rates. Once the black hole spin is large enough for a renewed jet, this inner jet will last longer the lower the accretion rate is. Hence, in a continuous accretion scenario, longer quiescent times tend to associate to longer inner jet times. In addition, DDRG jets are of FRII morphology which we show to result from the absence of a tilt in the accretion disk in the transition through zero black hole spin, ensuring the absence of an FRI jet in a way that connects with our understanding of X-shaped radio galaxies. Both correlated timescales as well as sameness in jet morphology offers evidence in favor of our picture.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error code: 429 - {'error': {'code': 'ServerOverloaded', 'message': 'The service is currently unable to handle additional requests due to server overload, please retry later or contact with administrator if not work afterwards.

The diversity in emission line profiles, ionization potentials, and kinematic signatures suggests a structured outflow emerging from the accretion disk, with different zones contributing to specific spectral features. High-ionization lines (e.g., Civ λ1549) exhibit strong blueshifts and asymmetric profiles indicative of fast, inner winds, while low-ionization lines (e.g., H\\b{eta}, Mgii λ 2800) show more symmetric profiles consistent with predominant emission from slower, denser regions farther out, although exhibiting systematic blueshifts in quasars radiating at high Eddington ratios. The intermediate ionization lines (e.g., Aliii λ1860) present a situation that is intermediate in terms of shift amplitudes, although in several super-Eddington candidates radial outflow velocity may reach values comparable to the ones of the high ionization lines. These results are consistent with radiatively driven wind models featuring radial stratification.

Using two recent large LAMOST catalogues of field, low-mass giant stars (both Li-rich and Li-poor) with metallicities from -4.0 to -1.0, we studied the conditions for Li enrichment and the distribution of stellar rotations in the Galactic halo and thick disc. Due to the scarcity of stars with [Fe/H] < -3.0, only three Li-rich RGB stars are known in this regime. The observational appearance of giants across the horizontal branch (HB) and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stages (with Li abundances up to 6.15 dex) has been detected for metallicities > -2.5. Among these stars, we detected IR excesses indicative of giant stars losing mass, showing a recent episodic Li-enrichment process related to the Cameron-Fowler mechanism for the formation of new 7Li. Because stars with IR excesses are distributed across most metallicity values, we suggest this mechanism is at work throughout an important part of the Galaxy's evolutionary history. Based on these IR excesses, we identified three Li thresholds: about 1.5 dex for RGB stars, about 0.5 dex for HB stars, and about -0.5 dex for AGB stars, establishing a new criterion to characterise Li-rich giants. We carried out a study of stellar rotations in metal-poor giant stars, revealing that a plateau appears for velocities greater than 40 km/s up to near 90 km/s, with Li abundances from 1.02 to 1.82 dex. Among Li-rich giants with v sin i > 40 km/s, increasing rotation is observed as metallicity decreases from -1.0 to -2.5.

We focus on the first stars and use stellar evolution simulations to track down how DM capture evolves over time from the zero-age main sequence to the late metal-rich stages of stellar evolution. During the early hydrogen-helium-dominated phase, the capture process is well described by scattering with two targets. As a star evolves, metal production leads to the formation of a dense core surrounded by a lighter envelope. The core significantly enhances the capture of ultra-heavy DM; in this case, three distinct nuclear species are required to accurately describe multiple-scattering capture. We use the Eddington inversion method to obtain a realistic DM velocity distribution, better suited when the star is near the center of a halo, than the widely used Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. We find that heavy DM would be able to thermalize and achieve capture-annihilation equilibrium within a massive star's lifetime for regions of the parameter space not excluded by direct detection. For non-annihilating DM, because of the high amount of targets available for capture and despite massive stars being short-lived, it would even be possible for DM to achieve self-gravitation and collapse to a black hole, which eventually could swallow the star from within before the expected end of the star's life, for non-excluded regions of the parameter space.

We propose a ''time aligned orbit'' that the readings of an ideal clock in this orbit could equal to the selenoid proper time in O2 and these readings could be converted to Lunar Coordinate Time in O1 by a known linear transformation.

The algorithm yields a deep null with just 0.2~dB reduction in main lobe directivity, despite lacking any constraints on main lobe pattern.

In the low-compactness regime, we derive analytical expressions showing that environmental effects generically shift the ISCO inward and the principal light ring outward, leading to parametric deviations in their associated orbital frequencies and Lyapunov exponents. At higher compactness, we explore the emergence of additional light rings, marginally stable orbits, and secondary horizons, identifying the regions of parameter space in which these ultracompact configurations arise.

Indeed, the neutrino flux predicted by the hadronic model for RS Oph was below IceCube sensitivity. T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), a nova similar to RS Oph, is anticipated to undergo an outburst soon. Being closer to Earth (0.8 kpc versus 2.45 kpc for RS Oph), T CrB is expected to yield a higher neutrino flux, making the upcoming outburst a once in a lifetime opportunity to test-and potentially detect-nova neutrinos. In this work, we present the first model-based estimates of the hadronic secondary fluxes from T CrB and assess their detectability with gamma-ray (LHAASO, Fermi-LAT, MAGIC, H.E.S.S., MACE, and HERD) and neutrino (IceCube and KM3NeT) telescopes.

In this work, we adopt the Fisher-matrix method to examine the angular-resolution performance of the newly proposed Crater Interferometry Gravitational-wave Observatory (CIGO) on the lunar crater rim near the north pole, together with TianQin and LISA, for monochromatic sources in the 0.1-10 Hz band. We find that above 0.1 Hz, CIGO achieves better localization accuracy than the other two space-based missions and dominates the combined detector network's performance, provided that lunar noise mitigation is achieved in the 0.1-2.87 Hz frequency range. We further explore an upgraded Tetrahedron configuration, TCIGO, with a fourth station at the bottom of a crater, which forms a regular tetrahedral constellation on the lunar surface. The result shows that TCIGO yields a five-fold improvement in angular-resolution capability over CIGO and gets better sky coverage across the target frequency band.", "AI": {"tldr": "研究发现，在0.1-10 Hz频段内，月坑边缘引力波干涉仪（CIGO）在0.1 Hz以上频率的定位精度优于天琴（TianQin）和LISA，且在0.1-2.87 Hz范围内抑制月球噪声后主导联合探测器网络性能；升级版四面体构型（TCIGO）将角分辨率提升五倍并改善全频段天空覆盖。", "background": "月球引力波干涉测量（lunar-based gravitational-wave interferometry）作为填补空间与地面探测器观测空白的新兴方法，旨在探索0.1-10 Hz频段内引力波源的定位性能。", "data": "采用费希尔矩阵(Fisher-matrix)方法分析月球北极附近环形山边缘的环形山干涉引力波天文台(Crater Interferometry Gravitational-wave Observatory, CIGO)及其升级版四面体构型(TCIGO)的角分辨率性能，其中TCIGO在环形山底部增设了第四个站点形成月球表面规则四面体星座。", "method": "采用费希尔矩阵法(Fisher-matrix method)分析月球坑边缘引力波观测站(CIGO)及其升级版四面体构型(TCIGO)在0.1-10赫兹频段对单色源的角分辨率性能。", "result": "在0.1-10 Hz频段内，CIGO（Crater Interferometry Gravitational-wave Observatory）在0.1 Hz以上频率的定位精度优于天琴（TianQin）和LISA（Laser Interferometer Space Antenna），且在0.1-2.87 Hz范围内有效抑制月球噪声时主导联合探测器网络性能；升级版四面体构型TCIGO（Tetrahedron CIGO）通过增加第四个站点形成月面规则四面体星座，其角分辨率能力较CIGO提升五倍且目标频段内天空覆盖更优。"}}

This increases by more than an order of magnitude the ensemble of binary stars with known characteristics, which previously numbered about 140 thousand pairs. To perform statistical analysis of the complete ensemble of binary stars, including both previously known and newly discovered pairs, cross-identification by coordinates was carried out between the most complete pre-Gaia publication compilative binary star catalog ILB and data from binary star catalogs based on Gaia DR3 results. An analysis of the results of this identification was performed, showing the dependence of its characteristics both on the data from the source catalogs and on coordinates. It is shown that in dense stellar fields, particularly in the Galactic disk, an increase in the fraction of false positive identifications can be expected. At the same time, for systems with large proper motion, there is a high probability of a false negative outcome. Possible modifications to the identification method are proposed to reduce the role of the described systematic errors and increase the reliability of its results.", "AI": {"tldr": "基于盖亚(Gaia) DR3数据创建了包含260多万对双星的星表，将已知特征的双星样本规模扩大了一个数量级以上，并分析了交叉识别结果的系统误差特征及改进方法。", "background": "基于盖亚(Gaia) DR3数据大幅扩展双星系统样本规模，聚焦双星统计特性研究及交叉识别方法优化。", "data": "数据来源为盖亚卫星第三次数据发布（Gaia DR3）和前人汇编的双星目录（ILB）。", "method": "采用坐标交叉匹配(cross-identification by coordinates)方法对盖亚(Gaia)DR3数据与ILB星表进行统计分析。", "result": "基于盖亚(Gaia) DR3数据构建的双星目录将已知特征的双星系统数量从约14万对提升至超过260万对，显著扩展了统计样本规模。"}}
